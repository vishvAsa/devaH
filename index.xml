      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2024/03/03/some-further-notes-on-the-mongol-religion-3/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some further notes on the Mongol religion-3&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The core of the material discussed in this note is based on the publications of the Hungarian-Mongolian Joint Expedition studying folk traditions in Mongolia and the masterly work of Igor de Rachewiltz on religion in the Secret History of the Mongols (SHM). We take a look at this material from a comparative religions and historical perspective. &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2021/07/01/some-further-notes-on-the-old-mongol-religion-2/&#34;&gt;A primer.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the Ṛgveda, the deities Dyaus and Pṛthivī (alternatively known as Bhūmī or Kṣāmā) generally occur as dyad — a devatā-dvandva of the form Dyāvāpṛthivī or Dyāvābhūmī or Dyāvākṣāmā — that may be rendered as Heaven and Earth. These devatā-dvandva-s are mentioned a total of 122 times in the RV. They are understood both as the parents of the gods and the universe (e.g., ya ime dyāvāpṛthivī janitrī rūpair apiṃśad bhuvanāni viśvā ।), and the stage for their acts. Imagine a religious system where these other gods recede into that backdrop or reside in a hidden realm that can only be seen by special individuals. What we would end up with is something like the overt religious system of the SHM. In that primal history (epic) of the Chingizid Mongols the chief religious protagonists are a precise cognate of the Indo-Aryan devatā-dvandva Dyāvāpṛthivī. In the Mongolian, it occurs in the form Tenggeri[Tengri]-Qajar, with Tengri being the cognate of Dyaus and Qajar being the cognate of Pṛthivī. Together, Tengri-Qajar are said to shape human events (Mo: jayaghan ~ destiny), provide the foundation for the existence of animals, and give “increase”, power, strength and protection. As per the SHM, together they conferred on Temüjin the lordship of the ulus and, in the same text, they are elsewhere mentioned as protecting Chingiz Khan and his army. They are explicitly mentioned to have aided Temüjin in the campaign again the Merkits along with Toghrul Wang Khan and Jamuqa to recover his wife, Börte. Thus, generally, the role of the Mongolian devatā-dvandva matches quite well with the Indo-Aryan Dyāvāpṛthivī. For instance, Atri invokes the dyad thusly:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This visualization might be solely mental/textual or expressed in different ways in the graphic and plastic arts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The mode of representation can change dramatically over time in the same religious tradition. For instance, we can infer that the early Indo-Europeans, going back to their Indo-Hittite past, had a fairly elaborate visualization of deities, but it was minimally expressed as physical iconography. However, different branches of Indo-Europeans convergently acquired physical artistic expressions of their pantheon in their loci of post-conquest settlement. Sometimes, these interacted with each other, resulting in fusions of styles. Thus, in the borderlands of the Panjab, there developed a vigorous iconographic tradition that brought together three distinct branches of Indo-European expression—the Hindus, the Iranics (Zoroastrian and Non-Zoroastrian), and the Greeks.+++(5)+++ The triumph of the Romans brought together the Greek and Roman traditions into a common iconographic expression that additionally swept in various non-IE articulations from West Asia and North Africa.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

That being Vak Devi as a Wrathful Lioness, as we hear of in the Taittiriya Samhita and the Shatapatha Brahmana of the Yajurveda.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The predominant art of the region of not just these tribes but&#xA;also including the entire Swat valley (the earlier territory of Kamboja&#xA;and Gandhara) also has been called ‘Dionysiac’ for their prolific use of&#xA;wine and ‘Bacchalic scenes.’ But, is it really ‘Dionysiac’? As wine&#xA;consumption and the other related art is well attested in the context of&#xA;the Western classical world and medieval Iran (Filigenzi, 2019: 56),&#xA;this resulted in a tendency to see such art form in the Swat valley to&#xA;be hierarchically dependent on the western classical world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

He says that he descends on his father’s side from an ancient Hunnic clan founded by a certain Yöngsiyebü, who was the lord of a tümen. He records an oral chant preserved by the clan on this ancient ancestor of theirs. On his mother’s side he claims descent from Chingiz Khan via Tsoktu Taiji (1581-1637 CE), the chief of Kokonor, who aided the practitioners of the ancient Bon religion of Tibet before they fell to the bauddha-s backed by the Oirat Mongols.+++(5)+++ Rinchen, with his connections to the old Mongol religion prior to its fall to the bauddha-s, records several notable features of its practice. As we have noted before on these pages, the fall of the old religion to the bauddha-s was neither smooth nor complete. In addition to the material collected by Heissig, we have deprecations such as this one from the old shamans against the religion and followers of the tathāgata invoking at the black (qara) “ghosts” or “spirits”:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;THE QUEEN OF SERPENTS – THE SERPENTINE FIGURE OF THE INDO-EUROPEAN EARTH MOTHER&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://aryaakasha.com/2020/12/18/the-queen-of-serpents-the-serpentine-figure-of-the-indo-european-earth-mother/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;figure class=&#34;&#34;&gt;&#xA;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;https://aryaakasha.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/ef9s3hzwkaea5we.jpg?w=1024&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;img src=&#34;https://aryaakasha.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/ef9s3hzwkaea5we.jpg?w=1024&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As we have often noted, the prevalent mythic perception of the Serpent amidst the minds of many is that of a demonic antagonist – and a male one, at that. There are solid reasons for this, of course: foremost among these is the Judeo-Christian baseline many of tend to operate under, where a certain serpent is indeed symbolic of the Arch-Enemy right from the Garden of Eden through to the End of Days. And, within the realms of the Indo-European mythology more endogenously, we have the incredibly prominent figure of the Demon-Dragon in the Waters – Vritra, Jormungandr, and others besides. It would be tempting, therefore, to relegate the role of the Serpent in our ancestral beliefs to that of the Adversary – as Something To Be Overcome [and certainly, ‘Vritra’ as ‘Obstacle’ is a not-entirely inappropriate translation].&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This often occurs in the context of the epithets&#xA;evaya or eṣa (meaning swift or ardent) being applied to them. This&#xA;association is not per say out of place or surprising because it might&#xA;be seen in the context of Viṣṇu accompanying Indra in the battle against&#xA;Vṛtra, where the Marut-s too accompany Indra as his troops (gaṇa-s).&#xA;Thus, they might be seen as surrounding Viṣṇu, one of the leaders of the&#xA;deva-s in this battle. However, this association is not purely a mythic&#xA;one — in the context of the RV it extends to the Marut-s and Viṣṇu being&#xA;invoked together for receiving offerings in a specific ritual. For&#xA;example, this is clearly stated by Gṛtsamada Śaunahotra:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Indeed, even the litany of the 1000 names begins with viśvaṃ viśṇur vaśatkāraḥ signaling the connection to that ancient layer of tradition, with viśvam i.e, “everything” being an etymological elaboration of his name Viṣṇu, “the all-pervader”. Further, vaṣaṭkāra indicates his link to the Vedic ritual (the vaṣaṭ offering to Viṣṇu is already specifically mentioned twice in the Ṛgveda) wherein we can trace the meteoric rise of this god as the head-deity of one of the great sectarian streams of the āstika-s.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Vrishchika of pretty tresses got off the bus and walked up the stairs to reach the over-bridge. She reached the middle of the bridge and stood there looking out expectantly at the road. It was a remarkably clear day and she could see the yonder horizon where the azure heights of father Dyaus met his lover mother Pṛthivī clad in the verdant vesture of the distant woods. Vrishchika passed into a reverie at that sight and remained oblivious to the throng of people who criss-crossed the bridge in either direction. Suddenly, an ugly man sidled up beside her and before she could react to his presence he said: “Ma’am do you visit the Hindu temple at Śukramārga?” Vrishchika: “On rare occasions.” The man responded: “We need wealthy patrons like you to visit the temple more often and make donations. Please do so devī”. So saying he handed a pamphlet to her. Vrishchika wondered: “A soothsayer at the temple of the Vāyu-born vānara had once told my family that I would be the wealthiest of all my sisters. But I’m hardly in that state now. Yet, why does he even think I’m wealthy?” She snapped out of that train of thought and waved the ugly man away saying “śubham astu! It is far way from my place but I’ll try.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Vrishchika of pretty tresses got off the bus and walked up the stairs to reach the over-bridge. She reached the middle of the bridge and stood there looking out expectantly at the road. It was a remarkably clear day and she could see the yonder horizon where the azure heights of father Dyaus met his lover mother Pṛthivī clad in the verdant vesture of the distant woods. Vrishchika passed into a reverie at that sight and remained oblivious to the throng of people who criss-crossed the bridge in either direction. Suddenly, an ugly man sidled up beside her and before she could react to his presence he said: “Ma’am do you visit the Hindu temple at Śukramārga?” Vrishchika: “On rare occasions.” The man responded: “We need wealthy patrons like you to visit the temple more often and make donations. Please do so devī”. So saying he handed a pamphlet to her. Vrishchika wondered: “A soothsayer at the temple of the Vāyu-born vānara had once told my family that I would be the wealthiest of all my sisters. But I’m hardly in that state now. Yet, why does he even think I’m wealthy?” She snapped out of that train of thought and waved the ugly man away saying “śubham astu! It is far way from my place but I’ll try.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2013/04/03/some-further-notes-on-the-mongol-religion/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The young Mongol scholar Dorje Banzar, published a book in 1846 in Russian at the university of Kazan that brought to light for the first time the old religion of the Mongols to the scholarly world. In the 1960s, M. Jaadamba, a descendent of Chingiz Kha’Khan, along with a group of Mongolian workers brought to light several texts and incantations of the ancient Mongol ritual that had never been seen before. We have alluded to some of these incantations on these pages before. This old religion of the Mongols has been considerably diluted by the missionary activity of the tAthAgata-s but remains in certain pockets of steppe eking out a precarious existence. Along with the hoary Shinto tradition of the eastern islanders it remains one of the important documents of old Eurasian ritual expression. We had early pointed out parallels between to &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2005/10/23/the-fire-hymns-of-the-mongols/&#34;&gt;Mongol fire ritual&lt;/a&gt; and the ancient Hindu one in the veda. We had also pointed to the interactions of the Mongol tradition with the Indo-Aryan and Iranian traditions, with elements such as the the &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2010/05/10/the-mahamayuri-vidya-rajni/&#34;&gt;nakShatra mantra-s&lt;/a&gt;, the equation of &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2007/12/06/the-confluence-of-four-paths/&#34;&gt;Köke Möngke Tengri with Ahura Mazda&lt;/a&gt; and the invocation of Darqan Guejir Tengri.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This triad is mentioned on a number of occasions&#xA;in the R^igveda. However, the R^igveda does not explicitly enumerate the&#xA;members of any of these three categories deva-s and only mentions some&#xA;of the members of each category by name. In the origin mythology&#xA;presented in RV 10.72 there is an allusion to 8 Aditya-s, but there is&#xA;hardly any evidence that this number was uniformly intended throughout&#xA;the RV. In the shatarudrIya of the yajur veda there is an allusion to&#xA;thousands of rudra-s (a concept preserved in the shaiva tantra-s,&#xA;especially of the Urdhva-srotas belonging to a much later era). The vasu&#xA;who is explicitly named in the RV is agni. Three Aditya-s, mitra, varuNa&#xA;and aryaman are frequently mentioned, but the other candidates of this&#xA;category are hazy (beyond aMsha and dakSha who are named but rarely if&#xA;ever made any offerings). In the brAhmaNa texts the number, if not the&#xA;identity, of the constituent deities in each category appears to have&#xA;been standardized. The gAyatrI is associated with the vasu-s as they are&#xA;8 in number and so is the number of syllables in a foot of this meter.&#xA;The triShTubh is associated with the rudra-s as they are 11 in number&#xA;and so is the number of syllables in a foot of this meter. The jagati is&#xA;associated with the Aditya-s as they are 12 in number and so is the&#xA;number of syllables in a foot of this meter. Since then, the number of&#xA;deities in each category has remained conserved in Hindu tradition. The&#xA;constituents of the vasu category were explicitly laid out first in the&#xA;shatapatha brAhmaNa as being the deities who composed the world namely&#xA;agni, vAyu, pR^ithivi, sUrya, antarikSha, dyaus, soma and nakShatra-s&#xA;(SB 11.6.3.6). Subsequent texts provided conceptually similar lists,&#xA;while trying to systematize to world-forming deities to a greater extant&#xA;by adjusting the names to include entities such light and water, and the&#xA;Pole star as a representative of the nakShatra category.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

In modern tantrika parlance the&#xA;suShumna mentioned in this R^ik is taken to mean the suShumna nerve&#xA;path, but it is clear that in the vaidika context in simply meant&#xA;well-disposed. This word (i.e. sumna) is often used in the context of&#xA;rudra. For those who are insiders of the mantra-shAstra and those who&#xA;are endowed with the j~nAna, certain words reveal the deep underlying&#xA;inspiration in the mantra. They who recognize the import these words are&#xA;able to instantly or gradually “connect” to the mantra and cognize or&#xA;see the devatA, unlike a lay practitioner, or an indologist, or one&#xA;merely filled with ignorant bhakti. In the case of vaidika mantra-s this&#xA;knowledge has declined among most practitioners. In the case of this&#xA;mantra the key words are “bhuvanasya pitaraM” and “bR^ihantaM&#xA;R^iShvam”]&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The wives of Mars and the Carmen Arvale</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2008/10/04/the-wives-of-mars/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In our earlier discussion we had argued based on structural homologies&#xA;the marut-s of the vedic system are “para-skanda”. We speculated that&#xA;kumAra himself descends from a para-vedic Indo-Iranian system, which&#xA;contained an ancestral version of the deity, who in that system was the&#xA;homolog of the marut-s of the vedic system. This para-vedic skanda was&#xA;laterally transferred to the vedic system in the late vedic period of&#xA;India. This transfer most probably occurred by an independent&#xA;Indo-Iranian invasion from the Northwest frontiers of India, prior to&#xA;the historical Iranian invasions of the Achaemenids, Sakas and&#xA;Kushana-s. By developing this line of argument further we accepted the&#xA;possible proto-Indo-European (probably excluding Hittite) origin of the&#xA;deity. In this light we are reasonably comfortable with the homology of&#xA;Mars and the Maruts: Given that the older Italic form Mars is Mavors,&#xA;their proto-IE ancestor can be accepted as *Mawort. The only&#xA;philological problem that does bother us a little is the vR^iddhi of the&#xA;initial vowel in the Italic branch.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The deva-s started unveiling themselves: the upward blaze of agni in the three stations, the power of vAyu, the all-encompassing indra, the natural conservations of mitra, the natural laws whose violations are punished by varuNa, the exhilaration of knowing the natural law in aryaman, the swift transmission of the maruts, the dissolution of natural bonds through their father, the archer rudra, the light of savitA, the warmth of puShA, distribution of energies through bhaga, the flow of time in viShNu, the Milky way and the earthly flows of sarasvatI, the chemistry of the ashvins, the clear reflection by bR^ihaspati, the revolutions and the cycles of the observable cosmos in soma and tvaShTa with the R^ibhus, the world axis and its precessions in Aja-ekapAd and ahir-budhnya, the origins in aditi and then the mysterious prajApati called ka, and national identity in the 3 goddess ilA, sarasvatI and bhAratI&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;2) Then the exploits of the great pinAkin-mahAdeva came to us. Having escaped from the worldly pursuit of riches for which our amAtya had much hope, we found ourselves in the dark defile between the two stacks where the wondrous deeds of rudra were to reveal themselves from the rudra saMhitA – the original core of the shiva purANa. The power of rudra was felt by us. We caught a glimpse of the greatness of kumara then, but we had to wait some more time till the great skanda vidyA manifested in all glory to us.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>maruts as &#34;para-skanda&#34; and other elements of their mythology</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2007/07/25/maruts-as-para-skanda-and-other-elements-of-their-mythology/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Many deities undergo drastic changes when they move across the&#xA;veda-purANa transition: Some lose status: e.g. indra; others lose status&#xA;and change character e.g. varuNa; others rise to exalted heights e.g.&#xA;viShNu and rudra. But their mythology is still rooted in large part in&#xA;their vedic antecedents. The marut-s are one of the most important&#xA;deities of the veda-s, praised by all clans of R^iShi-s in various hymns&#xA;and rituals. But the maruts not only fade away greatly, they but also&#xA;undergo a drastic shift in mythology. In the purANa-s the marut-s are&#xA;minor deities and are actually called sons of the mother demoness diti,&#xA;whose fetus indra cut up into seven pieces. Perhaps, this is a&#xA;misinterpretation of the vedic term sudAnava (good-giver) as su-dAnava&#xA;(the good demon). The maruts are reduced to mere winds in classical&#xA;Sanskrit, often used in singular as a synonym of vAyu, a very different&#xA;vedic deity. This synonymy is seen right from the rAmAyaNa, where&#xA;hanumAn, while inheriting many features of the vedic maruts, is&#xA;described as the son of vAyu/marut. As result of this, the maruts are&#xA;thoroughly misunderstood by the common Hindu and their true nature&#xA;remains shrouded. One point, while apparently rather obvious, is quite&#xA;completely ignored by most students of the veda and mythology as far as&#xA;I can see (The learned vaishya Prithvi Kumar Agrawala being a possible&#xA;exception): this is the relationship of marut-s with skanda. Hence, I&#xA;have decided to briefly outline the obvious:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2007/06/24/a-local-pantheon-of-mallanna/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A train of thought culminated in me remembering the peculiar case of the equestrian deity mallaNNa found in Ailoni. There is a smaller temple of mallaNNa in that village. Here he is depicted with his two wives with four arms hold a sword, trident, skull bowl and Damaru. His first wife is mADaladevI who is supposed to be umA incarnated amongst the lingAyata-s or gone kApu-s. She is depicted with a crown and two hands with a sword and skull bowl. She is the Andhra ortholog of mhALsA. His second wife is ketammA who is believed to be ga~NgA incarnated as a golla, and is the ortholog of bAnU. She is similarly armed as mADaladevI but has an elaborate hair-do instead of a crown. Also shown are 3 heads of Meccan demons or mlechCha-turuShka-s or yavana-kula daitya-s who where beheaded by mallaNNa.&#xA;He has a peculiar entourage of deities around him. He has a herd of sheep that he obtained from his wife ketammA. He has an army of 7 (or 7 times 100) dogs (vedic: shvabhya shvapatibhyashcha vo namaH; also compare with 7 fold troops of maruts). His brother is bayaNNa (a fierce bhairava; bhairoba in the mahArATTa country). There is a goddess poshammA who may have many arms and is like shAkambharI. There is then agni and vAyu. Then there is vAsukI or nAga-sarpaM. mallaNA is supposed to make 13 cups of sheep milk for the 7 dogs, bayaNNa, poshammA, vAsukI, agni, vAyu and himself. In the temple following this a ritual is performed where the cups of leaf are made and milk offered the deities. Here, as in some forms of the khaNDobA myth from mahArAShTra, mallaNNa is said to have incarnated to slay Meccan demons or green-robed demons who had seized the land in the age of kali and were tormenting the Hindus. maNi and malla may be called suratrANa-s who ruled from Bidar and some other place.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2007/01/16/mantra-of-trailokyavijaya/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The mantra of the goddess trailokyavijayA is provided by the&#xA;yuddha-jayArNava tantraM. A somewhat corrupt version of this tantra is&#xA;incorporated into the agni purANa. Stand-alone manuscripts of the YJA&#xA;also exist, though they have not been edited or published. In addition&#xA;to the version of the agni-purANa I had access to a hand-written&#xA;transcript on paper. The Dutch explorers have recovered a corrupt&#xA;version of the same in their collection of Hindu mantras known as&#xA;stuti-s and stava-s from Indonesia (now only surviving in Bali). All&#xA;these with a single input from oral tradition help to obtain the&#xA;critical version of the trailokyavijayA mantra as per the available&#xA;traditions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The sarvAtman hymn to viShNu</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2006/12/31/the-sarvatman-hymn-to-vishnu/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The sarvAtmAn hymn to viShNu shows some variations between recensions&#xA;and traditions but form accepted amongst smArtas has 40 core shlokas&#xA;corresponding to Mbh 12.47.23-63. This an extremely important hymn of&#xA;viShNu, comparable to the hymn to rudra by the goat-faced dakSha. The&#xA;R^iShi of sarvAtmaka mahAvaiShNava stotra is given as bhagavAn vyAsa,&#xA;the Chandas is anuShTubh, the devAtA is sarvAtmaka mahA-viShNu.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Its importance lies in the fact that it might represent one of the&#xA;earliest post-vedic compositions to viShNu, within an early vaiShNava&#xA;lineage that was strongly affiliated with vedic ritualism. An important&#xA;point to note is that the critical version of the hymn shared by all&#xA;recensions and practiced by smArtas does not have any mention of the&#xA;avatAra-s or the vAsudeva-centric elements of sAttvata that contributed&#xA;to pA~nchAratra. So its original composition was possibly outside of&#xA;these streams and was latter swallowed into the sAttvata context (as&#xA;much of the vaiShNava material in the mahAbhArata belongs to the early&#xA;sAttvata tradition). We suspect that there were 3 streams of early&#xA;vaiShNavism: 2 associated with the kR^iShNa yajurvedins: 1) The&#xA;taittirIyas, of which the vaikhAnasa branch gave rise to an early&#xA;vaiShNava system. 2) the kaTHas who possibly incorporated an early&#xA;avatAra model centered on yaGYa-varaha (viShNu smR^iti, viShNu-dharma&#xA;and viShNu-dharmottara eventually emerged from this school). 3) The&#xA;sAttvata-s who promulagated the chatur-vyUha system and developed other&#xA;aspects of the avatAra concept centered on kR^iShNa. This was the&#xA;precursor of the later pA~ncharAtra. It is possible, but not certain,&#xA;that this school might have had association with a shukla-yajurvedic&#xA;shAkha called ekAyana. This school was strong in Mathura and interacted&#xA;with the early shaivas and kaumAra-s, who also have a presence in the&#xA;mahAbhArata. In later history all these three schools extensively&#xA;exchanged concepts, espcially in terms of the avatAra concept.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2006/12/11/devata-chitra-samgraha/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The eldest son of the great king of Nepal, pR^ithivi nArAyaNa shahA (who&#xA;defeated the British and founded the Nepal Kingdom until its recent&#xA;destruction by Marxists), pratApa siMha, compiled a voluminous work on&#xA;the mantra shAstra during his brief life. As a companion to this a&#xA;collection of pictures for the dhyAna-s on various deities was prepared&#xA;by the artists in Nepal. A copy of this collection with R1’s father is&#xA;of considerable interest in terms of tradition Hindu dhyAna art of which&#xA;not many old samples survive. That this Hindu tradition was very old is&#xA;shown by the chitra-kalA section of the viShNudharmottara. Here the&#xA;bhArgava mArkaNDeya gives a lecture on drawing and painting and&#xA;specifically provides the principal lakShaNas that should depicted in&#xA;paintings of devatAs. Most of the drawings in this collection are pretty&#xA;exquisite and depict the following deities:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2006/12/05/paschimamnayeshvari-and-shiva-of-the-shikha/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We first salute the master of the school, matsyendra and ku~nkumAMbA&#xA;who was his kulA~NganA without whom none of these mysteries would be&#xA;known to us mortals.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;“siddhamAtA vibhuH shabdarAshIti yonyArNavI vAgvishuddhAsi vAgeshvarI”&lt;br&gt;&#xA;That provides the inspiration of the rudra-shaktI – mahAsenasambhoginI.&#xA;The one with pretty curves, who is the queen under the chinchini tree,&#xA;manifests simultaneously in all her glory in the great oDDiyAna,&#xA;jAlandhara, pUrNagiri and kAmarUpa. The very name kubjIshAna causes the&#xA;ullAsa that cannot be described in words, the leading steps on the kula&#xA;path. Even a moment of revelation of kubjIshAna is just like the&#xA;drinking of the tIvra soma, sweeted for the sacrificial rite. He is the&#xA;glorious navAtman like a thunder cloud, the wielder of the pinAka bow.&#xA;On his lap, like streak of brilliant lightning illuminating that roaring&#xA;thunder cloud is our goddess, paschimAmnAyeshvarI, the queen of the&#xA;samayavidyA. The one who can recite the daNDakaM recalls the words “tvaM&#xA;navAtmAnadevasya chotsa~NgayAnAshritA“.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;From the 32 syllabled samayavidyA’s shikhA mantra emanates svachChanda,&#xA;who is the manifestation of the tantric aghora mantra. One who has&#xA;stilled his mind for the expansion of the mighty samayavidyA sees a&#xA;preta ma~ncha. On that is seated lokeshvara, the mighty yogin bearing&#xA;the universe in him. On him emerges a bright blue lotus. In the pericarp&#xA;of that lotus is seen the terrific serpentine ananta, blazing forth with&#xA;all-conquering power of heat and other radiations. He is the deadly&#xA;kAlasaMkarShaNa, armed with a musala and halAyudha. On his shikhA is&#xA;seen an eight-petalled lotus. In that is the powerful shiva of the&#xA;shikhA or svachChanda. From him emerge 32 brilliant mayUkhas, which are&#xA;the energies of the samaya-vidyA. He is adorned by ornaments of various&#xA;colors. He has 4 heads and 10 hands and inspires extreme terror. At the&#xA;same time he is imbrued with the shR^ingAra rasa and tightly hugs a devI&#xA;of dark color, the great dUtI, with ornaments of all colors. In her&#xA;manifests the power of the vaShaT.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The green elements mark the fire&#xA;altars&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He sat in the place where the first of the pieces had fallen. In his&#xA;mind’s eye h remembered the tale of the great grahanatha: “tArakAsura&#xA;the accursed enemy of the gods wore a li~Nga around his neck that&#xA;protected him from death as long as it was there. As he fought viShNu&#xA;and vIrabhadra their weapons failed on him after prolonged and fierce&#xA;duels. Finally the one born of the arrow-forest charged forth to meet&#xA;the daitya. After a prolonged duel he finally struck the daitya with his&#xA;charmed shakti, from which none escape. The shakti shattered the li~Nga&#xA;into 5 fragments and the pierced the daitya-s broad chest slaying him.&#xA;The pieces of the li~Nga fell on pR^ithivi and each became a&#xA;maha-li~Nga in which The god is worshiped.” It was near the first of&#xA;these pieces he had constructed a kumAra gR^iha. After having performed&#xA;the kha-chakra-dharaNi he offered the oblations to the bull-headed&#xA;nandikeshvara at the appropriate altar. Then he moved over to the altar&#xA;of pilipichChikA and offered seven oblations: pilipichChikA, revatI,&#xA;shakunI, ShaShThi, jAtahAriNi, mukhamaNDikA and devasenA on the&#xA;pa~nchami day. Even as the last oblation hit the fire a terrifying&#xA;graha named pariprakAsha arose, filling the air with awe that only the&#xA;masters of the mahAmantra know. He muttered the graha-stotraM was&#xA;transported to the great mound of shrI-parvata by that awful graha. Atop&#xA;shrIparvata he remained lying at night performing the complete cycle of&#xA;the kha-chakra-dhyAna. He joined the siddhaugha.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

When his eyes were closed by umA’s&#xA;hand which had the complexion of coral and a golden lotus the universe&#xA;turned exceedingly dark, for after all he is soma-sUryAgni-lochana.&#xA;umA’s hands heated by his eye on the forehead began to sweat copiously&#xA;and resulted in divine conception due to contact with the god. A&#xA;terrifying being manifested itself. It was blind, deformed, and black in&#xA;complexion, with matted locks of hair on the head and fine down all over&#xA;the body. It sang and laughed horribly, danced and put out its tongue&#xA;like a serpent and roared fiercely. haimavatI aghast at the sight asked&#xA;what it was. rudra said, you made it yourself by closing my eyes. She&#xA;took her hands of his eyes and as the light came back the being looked&#xA;even more hideous. rudra said: this awful being is andhaka, the blind&#xA;one, who was born when you closed my eyes. Take care of him well as he&#xA;is an object of our creation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The shArikA-tripurA krama of&#xA;aghora-shiva is related in terms of the formulae to dakShiNa-mUrti&#xA;virachita uddhAra-kosha, a famous work on mantra shAstra that contains&#xA;most of these formulae. The aghora-shiva here is the south-face of rudra&#xA;or dakShiNa-mUrti. Many similar or same formulae are also found in the&#xA;well-known devI-rahasya tantra. The central manifestation of the shakti&#xA;are shArikA and tripurA, and then there are the faces of the cardinal&#xA;directions comprised of the mantras of the AmnAya krama. Note that in&#xA;this procedure the base tripurA mantra is derived from kAdi-vidyA and&#xA;not the hAdi-vidyA.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

In days&#xA;long past I was wandering in the fringes of the magadha, when I stumbled&#xA;into the mighty brahmin, kashyapa, the son of marIchI. I asked him to&#xA;narrate to me the tale of the wonderous exploits of skanda and his&#xA;agents.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;kashyapa said: “Listen sUta this ancient story of the great god kumAra,&#xA;the commander of the deva forces and his agents. In the ancient kalpa,&#xA;after the devas had drunk the amR^ita, the asura-s smarting due to their&#xA;outwitting sought to avenge themselves. The gods have won account of vAk&#xA;they said. We too shall strive with our vAk, declared dundubhi the lord&#xA;of the asuras. All the asuras put forth their mighty vAk simulataneously&#xA;and from the asura-vAk was born the deadly asura-kanyA, dIrgha-jihvI.&#xA;The asuras then attacked the gods and a fierce battle broke out. The&#xA;devas fought with their ranks comprised of the vasus, the rudras and&#xA;Adityas, and their commander-in-chief being the six-headed skanda. He&#xA;had with him his brothers and gaNa-s lead by shAkha, vishAkha, nejamesha&#xA;and the bull-headed nandI. At first the deva assault drove back the&#xA;asuras to pAtAla, but then they let out their secret agent-&#xA;dIrgha-jihvI. Of black color and with many strong arms and a long&#xA;lolling tongue the asura-kanyA rushed on the deva army. She started&#xA;eating up the weapons shot by the devas and licking them up with her&#xA;long tongue. Seeing their army in disarray the deva-s huddled around&#xA;their commander kumAra and asked him to aid them in battle.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The&#xA;term aratau has been somewhat obscure to some commentators. It is a&#xA;synonym of aratni, which means a unit length (probably ell), which is a&#xA;metaphor for the samidh which might be an aratni long.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Now we shall&#xA;describe that meditation of and the mantra emanation from it.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;-As one starts the meditation of the pa~nchAkSharI one sees the maNDala&#xA;of eight kalA goddesses appearing in the eight directions:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;vAmA- brilliant white complexion, (E); jyeShThA -blood red, (SE);&#xA;raudri- white again, (S); kAlI- bright yellow, (SW) ; kalavikariNI-&#xA;purple, (W); balavikariNI- shining gold, (NW); balapramathanI-black, (N)&#xA;sarvabhUtadamanI-light red, (NE). manonmanI appear in the middle of the&#xA;maNDala with complexion of a bright blowing light. One then realizes&#xA;manonmanI within one self and the entire maNDala of the kalA goddesses&#xA;surround you.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2006/09/26/wanderings-in-oddiyana/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Long ago the great old vaiShNava wandered in the hallowed oDDiyAna&#xA;pITha, when he reached an old desolate prAsada towards the evening hour.&#xA;There he seated himself and concentrated ThaM bIja. Then the divine&#xA;boar-faced mistress of the 5th lunar digit graced him. She of most&#xA;beautiful waist appeared there with curly locks and bearing two shining&#xA;tusks on her snout. Her awesome hips were draped by a most excellent&#xA;blue and golden vesture and she held the still-bloody pestle with which&#xA;she had smashed the skull of visha~Nga. She who is called the&#xA;sa~nketA, who is seated in the Aj~nAchakra of the enlightened ones,&#xA;had lustrous bangles that shone like rings of light and her shapely&#xA;breasts, like jewel pots, were smeared with sweet-smelling saffron. The&#xA;glorious sa~nketA also held a halAyudha that was washed with the blood&#xA;of daityas slain by her in combat. The twang of her deadly bow filled&#xA;the sky with thunder-like roars and their reverberations. On sa~nketA’s&#xA;car fluttered banners bearing buffaloes, deer and lions. In front of her&#xA;marched a vanguard of dreaded bhairava-s, dark as collyrium in&#xA;complexion, with tawny locks of hair and led by the four handed&#xA;terrifying chaNDochChaNda. She was followed by an army of boar-faced&#xA;goddesses with shapely bodies colored like the dark bark of tamAla tree&#xA;(Xanthochymus pictorius). They had tawny hair and ruthless eyes, and&#xA;held terrible weapons similar to those of samayasa~nketA. Smoke and&#xA;flames shot forth from their snouts. and the curved tusks illuminated&#xA;the darkness like crescent moons.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;They rode on charging buffaloes, while a few of these sow-faced&#xA;goddesses diffused away guarding the flanks prancing around with their&#xA;swords and shields. They advanced before them a fleet of siege engines&#xA;known as talavR^inta-s that formed a barricade for their division.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

However, in the&#xA;exploration of Satmala we did see a couple of iconic padmavatI images.&#xA;One of them was still in worship and another was largely in neglect in a&#xA;dung-ridden area. This image was strange in having a nAstIka arihant&#xA;inscribed on her. A drAviDa nastIka savant brought to my attention that&#xA;they worshiped padmAvatI as a shasana devI, that is an agent of a&#xA;nAstIka tirthankara. He gave me a print of the jaina version of the&#xA;deity that resembled the weathered image in part. This suggests that&#xA;padmAvatI was worshiped by nAstIka-s as well as astIka-s and tribes in&#xA;that region. I wonder if the padmAvatI at Venkatadri is also a&#xA;syncretized version of the old padmAvatI widely worshiped throughout the&#xA;Deccan in the early medieaval period.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

However, in the south his successor ectype shAstR^i is still worshiped in the folk religion. We have long wanted collate a file on this deva and revive his rites as we are amongst the few still adhering to his worship. We have been made aware of some other works on him but we have not read those.   Mythology   The purANas narrate the core myth of the origin of the god revanta thus:   vivasvAn was given sanj~nA as his wife by tvasTA vishvakarman. vivasvan begot the twins yama and yamI, and manu vaivasvata through her. However, sanj~nA was unable to endure the excessive fiery lustre of vivasvAn and decided to leave him and go to the regions of the uttara kuru. She created a replica of herself in the form ChAyA and placed her with vivasvAn before retiring in the form of a mare. vivasvAn took ChAyA too be sanj~nA and begot on ChAyA, the inauspicious shanaishchara, the daughter tapatI and manu sAvarNI. One day ChAyA got into a conflict with the death-like yama vaivasvata as she mis-treated her foster son. Thus vivasvAn realized that ChAyA was not sanj~nA and through his dUradR^iShTi located her in the uttara kuru regions as a mare. So he assumed the form of a stallion and reached there. They copulated first via their nostrils, spawning the ashvins and then internally spawning revanta. He was born with a sword and bow, riding a horse and bearing a quiver full of arrows. vivasvAn said to revanta that he shall be the lord of the guhyaka tribe of yakShas and yakShiNI-s. He mentioned that at the time of forest fires and volcanic eruptions, and when dasyus and mlechChas devastate the land the mortal need to invoke revanta to obtain relief.&#xA;Versions of this tale are narrated in the viShNu (VP 3.2) and mArkaNDeya (MkP 78) purANa-s. The matsya (MP 11.2) and agni (AP 272.3; 273 in MBLD edition) purANa-s narrates a variant in which vivasvAn has a separate wife rAj~nI through whom he fathers revanta. The devi bhAgavataM mentions revanta as riding on uchChaishravas to visit viShNu, when lakShmI gets fascinated by the horse and fails to pay attention to viShNu. As a result he cursed lakShmI to became a mare and generates the haihaya dynasty in this account (DB 6.17-18).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The yakShiNI-s are of&#xA;diverse forms, all very wonderful and amazing. They bear many diverse&#xA;facets of knowledge — he who can acquire them all becomes sarva-vyApin.&#xA;But the knowledge is not easily acquired from the yakShiNI. There are so&#xA;many ways in which they slip away after it has been shown to you by her.&#xA;After you land from the flight of the yakShiNI, it may evaporate from&#xA;you. Or in the delusion of the wonderous form of the yakShiNI, the&#xA;knowledge might escape from you. Some wonderous yakShiNI-s carry what&#xA;may be called “useless knowledge”. It can be endlessly fascinating but&#xA;cannot be acquired by those not fit for it, or knowing it takes you down&#xA;a path a failure.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It is different from the amR^iteshvara vidya,&#xA;like that described in the netra tantra tradition. The latter is&#xA;shAntaM, while the saMkShipta bhairava formulae are ghoraM. It can also&#xA;be used for mAraNa strikes when conjoined with mahAmArI, the mate of the&#xA;fierce bhairava, and the mantra of yama. The bhArgava mArkaNDeya is the&#xA;R^iShi of the mantra of the terrifying saMkShipta bhairava. He is&#xA;meditated upon holding mahAmArI in his grasp. He is dancing on preta-s&#xA;lying on the shmashAna. His face is terrifying with 3 eyes and a crown&#xA;of upward-standing hair. He has sharp fangs in his mouth. He has 8 arms,&#xA;and holds a trident, the pinAka bow and pAshupata missile, a&#xA;skull-topped khaTvA~Nga, a lasso, sword, a chakra and a fire pot. His&#xA;wife mahAmArI is of deep blue complexion, with long flowing locks of&#xA;black hair and is embracing the fiery bhairava. The frightful yama is&#xA;standing revertially worshiping them. Beyond him is standing the most&#xA;bewitching pradhAna yakShiNI, pramodA with her yakShiNI hordes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

One of&#xA;the older streams before its standardization in the tradition of the&#xA;kubjikAmata and ShaTsAhasra streams was the worship of kubjikA conjoined&#xA;with the five headed shiva (distinct from the other representations&#xA;where she is conjoined with shiva as navAtman (also alluded to in the&#xA;saundaryalahari; while mainly devoted to kulasundarI, 34, 39 and 41&#xA;refer to kubjikA) or has paramashiva above her) . This tradition is&#xA;associated with ancient pre-matsyendra siddha guru-s like,&#xA;bhR^igvAnandanAtha, rA~ngulAnandanAtha, samvartAnandanAtha and their&#xA;wives, and others whose feet are offered tarpaNaM-s in the guru-maNDala.&#xA;Here she is worshipped with shiva showing all his five faces sadyojAta,&#xA;vAmadeva, tatpuruSha, aghora and IshAna. He holds a trident and a&#xA;Damaru. The hallowed mother kubjikA has 6 faces; the cobras karoTaka as&#xA;a waist band, takShaka as a mid-riff ornament, vAsuki as garland and the&#xA;venomous cobra kulika as an ear ornament. The great tortoise is her ear&#xA;stud. She holds in her arms as skull, a king-cobra, a crystal-bead&#xA;rosary, skull-topped rod, a conch, a book, a trident, a mirror, a&#xA;straight sword, a gem necklace, an a~NkuSha and a bow. She is of fair&#xA;complexion like a young jasmine flower. The yantra of this worship is&#xA;provided above.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

R1, A&#xA;and our clan had similar histories with peregrinations through the&#xA;length of jambudvIpa over time in the practice and quest of the&#xA;mantra-shAstra. R1’s clan had moved back recently to the Southern realms&#xA;after 2.5 centuries in the land of the malla rAjas. R1 who treated us as&#xA;son also opened our eyes to some remarkable matters- she us acquainted&#xA;with her father, who was one the last holders of the vidyA’s of the&#xA;ShaTsAhasra tradition (since R1 was cashing her brahminical check).&#xA;Thus, I learnt some of these rahasyas that I wish to record as they are&#xA;in danger of extinction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Of course its prakaTa as&#xA;pratya~NgirA needs the inter-twining with the atharvamukha, of which&#xA;the bhinna yoni is itself a prakaTa rUpa. Its manifestation as&#xA;parameshvarI is can be seen in the stand alone bhinna yoni vidyA, though&#xA;a practioner of the bhrigu-A~Ngirasa shruti notes the deep concordance&#xA;with the atharvamukha constantly. Its manifestation as mAlinI, as stated&#xA;from the mouth of trishiro-bhairava is in the form of the mahordhva&#xA;li~Nga and the laghu-yoni. “Oh girl of pretty hips, whose firm breasts&#xA;are the mounds of manmatha-kalA, how many shrikaNThas and shiva-yuvati-s&#xA;manifest when we triangulate the great upward li~Nga with 3 equal&#xA;sides, 6-fold times ? There is one more shiva-yuvati than those of the&#xA;shrikaNThas. He who knows this knows the vidyA”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Arimaspas, dinosaurs, griffins and sharabha.</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2006/05/20/the-arimaspas-dinosaurs-griffins-and-sharabha/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A persistant Indo-Iranian motif is that of the griffin, occuring in&#xA;India as the sharabha. The sharabha may be described as an imaginary&#xA;animal or as an incarnation of rudra in that form. The famous&#xA;sharbhAstra weapon and the sharabhAstra mantra invoke this form of&#xA;rudra. The form of viShNu known as the gaNDabherunda nR^isiMha is also&#xA;inspired by the same beast. The greek chroniclers recorded the griffins&#xA;as being associated with an Iranian tribe on the steppe known as the&#xA;Arimaspas. They were described as great horsemen, as their name suggests&#xA;and are supposed to have fought the griffins. The griffins are also&#xA;described as fighting the Amazons. The griffins are supposed to have&#xA;guarded gold in central Asia from the Arimaspas. The Pazyryk graves&#xA;which have been studied over the past century in detail have gold&#xA;articles, griffin depictions and contain the bodies of female steppe&#xA;warriors. This suggests that the tales of the Arimaspa and the Amazons&#xA;are confused Greek accounts for Indo-Iranian tribes of the far east,&#xA;from whose midst the reports of the griffins first started emerging.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2006/05/08/the-second-circle/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We had sought she who dwells in the midst of the kiri chakra. Our&#xA;AchArya’s AchArya the one learned in the great atharvan lore with all&#xA;its parishiShTha-s, kalpa-s brAhmaNa and upaniShads retired to live in&#xA;the most picturesque land south of lATa pradesha, with forests largely&#xA;inhabited by niShAda tribes. There on the banks of the Damanganga river&#xA;he settled down with the forest providing him the quietude and oShadhI-s&#xA;for his rites. We decided after the great battle of tIkShNa jvara to&#xA;proceed to the sylvan slopes of Damanganga to spend time in tapasya and&#xA;acquisition of the vidyAs of the goat-headed one and she who dwells in&#xA;the midst of the kiri chakra. We got into the train that bore us on the&#xA;long journey and then we used a ratha to reach the silent Ashrama on the&#xA;banks of the Damanganga to go with our acts. The setting was most&#xA;splendid. We found that path through which ShaShThinAtha and his wife&#xA;AryamekhalA had traversed the regions infested with fierce kirATas and&#xA;bhilla-s to reach the shores skirting the sahayAdrI’s. There we went to&#xA;the ancient kumAra gR^iha, we as the sun was reaching the western peg.&#xA;The pleasant breezes were blowing from the west and we sat by the&#xA;chaitya. The amaraugha of his includes rudra, himavat’s pretty daughter,&#xA;agni and ga~Nga. The mAnavaugha began with vishvAmitra and haimavatI,&#xA;passing through, brahmAskanda, through ShaShThinAtha and AryamekhalA.&#xA;From him to saMbhadra and divyamekhalA. Then the mAnavaugha split into&#xA;the ogha of the adhoretas who moved along the paschima mayUkha and&#xA;pUrNagiri pITha and ogha of the Urdhvaretas that dwelt in prAchya&#xA;mayUkha and then moved to kumAra tapovana. We joined the adhoretasas,&#xA;being of this world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2006/04/22/dandins-purvapithika-of-dasha-kumara-charitra/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The 3rd stride of viShNu as well as his snake is the enduring Hindus&#xA;symbol of the axis that precesses with the passage of kAla or time.&#xA;Right from the R^igveda this axial role of viShNu is at the fore in all&#xA;conceptions of him. We have alluded to this a few times before, see:&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2004/12/06/the-snake-of-vishnu/&#34;&gt;snake of&#xA;viShNu&lt;/a&gt;,&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2005/09/05/the-finnish-epic/&#34;&gt;the Finnish&#xA;epic&lt;/a&gt;,&#xA;and more obliquely in &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2005/08/07/the-fall-of-prahlada/&#34;&gt;fall of&#xA;praHlAda&lt;/a&gt;.&#xA;The element of the axis and its precession is very much a part of the&#xA;“core mythology” of viShNu: 1) the horn of matsya- the new axis being&#xA;provided for the world after its shift due to precession. 2) The mandAra&#xA;mountain as the staff for the churning of the world ocean being borne by&#xA;viShNu on his back in the form of kUrma. 3) varAha raising the “world&#xA;plane” with his tusks- the world plane being the equatorial circle&#xA;intersecting the ecliptic. It had sunk because the precession had pushed&#xA;the old intersection with the ecliptic below the plane. 4) nR^isimha&#xA;emerging by shattering the pillar- the old axis is broken by the flow of&#xA;time by precession. 5) trivikrama with his three steps stabilizes the&#xA;new world plane (equatorial circle), the ecliptic’s high point (step 2)&#xA;and the precessing axis (step 3). It is in this context that the great&#xA;R^ikSha jAmbavant is described as circumambulating trivikrama as he took&#xA;his great strides. This represents the new axis being established and&#xA;the constellation of the Great Bear (represented as the bear jAmbavant)&#xA;making a circle of the north celestial pole. Indeed viShNu himself is&#xA;identified with the constellation of the shishumAra or Draco associated&#xA;with the old north pole from earlier period of Aryan memory. As the&#xA;knowledge of precession is very subtle (even alluded in the opening of&#xA;the maitrayaNi brAhmaNa fragment by shAkAyanya who was well aware of&#xA;these matters) the third step of viShNu is secret and was only know to&#xA;the great kavi-s.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2006/04/16/the-peculiar-mythology-behind-the-mayavamana-mantras/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The hAdi mata votaries from the North also preserved a range of kramas,&#xA;now largely reduced to auxilliary rites associated as AvarNa invocations&#xA;of their primary rite of tripurasundarI. This follows the basic pattern&#xA;seen in the shrIvidyArNava’s procedures. Many of these are strikingly&#xA;interesting such as the invocation of the terrific graveyard-ranging&#xA;bahurUpa bhairava and his wife, a special mantra of the supreme&#xA;Anandabhairava, the 8-handed amR^itasUrya invocation and the formulae&#xA;derived from the kaTha yajurveda. Here, however I briefly allude to a&#xA;remarkable “left-handed” form of viShNu and his mythology.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Some bagalAmukhi deployment that I have&#xA;come across include: 1) the dhattUra haritAla lepana prayogaM- the&#xA;yellow orpinient made from a mixture of dhattUra bIja and turmeric which&#xA;can used for stambhana and vashikaraNa. 2) The mR^ittika vR^iShbha&#xA;prayogaM -its effects can resemble the effects of certain dhUmAvatI&#xA;prayoga-s and can be mistaken for them. It is pretty debilitating. 3)&#xA;The vAma kapAla prayogaM- can cause a severe stambhana of the victim. 4)&#xA;The shava vastra maNdUka prayogaM- can paralyze the tongue or throat of&#xA;the shatru. 5) The ATarUShaka prayogaM- can destroy attacking law&#xA;enforcement agents. 6) indrAvAruNika prayogaM- can protect from being&#xA;tortured by law enforcement agents. And there are several others.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2006/03/11/the-left-handed-ashtha-mukha-gandabherunda-nrikeshari-mantra/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is said that there are two emanations of the mantra of the most&#xA;terrible aShTha-mukha gaNDabheruNDa nR^isimha (AMGN)- a dakShiNa and&#xA;vAma form. The right-handed form is said to lie in the text termed the&#xA;bhIma-tantra which is a upa-tantra of the ananta-vijaya saMhitA of the&#xA;viShNu-yAmala tradition. The left-handed form is said to like in the&#xA;text termed vAmA-tantra which is also an upa-tantra of the ananta-vijaya&#xA;saMhitA. Not much is know of the full extant of these texts ( if they&#xA;survive in an degree at all they are obviously kept a close secret) but&#xA;fragments relevant to ritual performance have been transmitted to those&#xA;in the know. It is however clear that the left-handed vidya has&#xA;propagated considerably in various guises. AMGN is said to have 8 heads&#xA;of the leonine form with saber teeth, whereas two heads of the&#xA;dinosaurian form (which are apparently concealed as per the vAma&#xA;mantra). He has 16 hands with a garland of skulls and holds a chakra,&#xA;trident, gadA, sword, bow and arrow, in addition to various other&#xA;weapons. The mantra was narrated thus by mahAdeva to ishAnI when she&#xA;embraced him and kissed him:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

However, their proper deployment remains&#xA;unknown except to one who has mastered the true rahasyas. The mantras of&#xA;the practioners of the chInAchAra are nowhere in the league of these&#xA;rahasya mantras. 8 principal apsaras may be invoked with apasara maNDala&#xA;though tillotamA may be offered a special sacrifice for the highest&#xA;purpose. The apasaras who are invoked are:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;shashidevI, tillotamA, kA~nchanamAlA, kuNDalahAriNi, ratnamAlA, rambhA,&#xA;urvashI and bhUshiNI.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

These idols were originally from temples of&#xA;trishiro bhairava near parihAsapura. They show the left side ugramukha&#xA;which is (rudra murti) and may have a kapAla, kamaNDalu and akShamAla in&#xA;the hands. The same iconography is retained for dattAtreya but, the&#xA;kApAla of the trishirobhairava form is not seen. The temples were&#xA;destroyed and the idols damaged by the Moslems and their current status&#xA;is unclear. The representation of the deity as trishiro-bhairava and&#xA;dattAtreya were both supposed to have dogs beside them, but their&#xA;presence in these idols is unknown.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It comes&#xA;out from the sudarshana disc.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;mahAsudarshana chakra: This is powered by padmanAbha and has 12&#xA;spokes. It is the destroyer of the asuras and the fiery atri durvAsa.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;sahasrAra chakra: This is the wheel powered viShNu manifesting in the&#xA;parame vyoman. It blazes with a 1000 spokes with all chakras, terrible&#xA;shUlas, musalas, halAyudhas, gadAs, prAsa and other weapons surrounding&#xA;it.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;</description>

The primary manifestation of nArAyaNa is vAsudeva, from whom emerge saMkarShaNa and pradyumna. From pradyumna emerges aniruddha. This pantheon appears to be a unique feature of the yadu tribes that subsequently seems to have spawned the classical pA~ncharAtra. However, the early texts suggest that there was another parallel system that appears to have largely passed out of subsequent vaiShNavism. That was the cult of the goddess ekAnamshA.

With one&#xA;of his arms was holding the most beautiful madhumati of sweet smiles in&#xA;an embrace around her gold-girt slender waist. In his other hands he&#xA;held a mace, a trident, the blazing sudarshana, and a conch. He was of&#xA;fair complexion, youthful and energetic with ever-smiling faces. The&#xA;delightful madhumati would occassionally cast her arms around him, like&#xA;a jasmine creeper winding around a full-grown khadira tree, and she&#xA;would bring her face close to his. Their eyes would meet, exchanging&#xA;glances of the highest bliss. The great trimukha would hold her face&#xA;with his hand, and it would seem like a lotus sprouting from a pond&#xA;under the pleasant spring sun. In her hands, madhumati held a chalice of&#xA;sweet maireya liqour, which she would playfully quaff. Occasionally she&#xA;would pass the chalice full of mirth to trishiras and they would quaff&#xA;together in eternal Ananda. The bIja eM was constantly resonating around&#xA;madhumati even as she with her dazzling beauty concealed the&#xA;three-headed one from the gaze of on lookers. They might stop in a&#xA;secluded slyvan grotto and engage in kAmakrIDa, nR^itya and aTTahAsa. In&#xA;the highest ecstasy of pleasure the mighty tryAnana offered madhumati&#xA;the premaratna – the gem of love, and having nothing greater to offer in&#xA;return, madhumati, full of rasa, matched it by offering her own breasts.&#xA;The incomparable trimUrtI clasping her breasts in his hands, gently&#xA;placed a camphor flavored betel leaf between her pearl-like teeth. Then&#xA;sporting with nails, polished like the mother-of-sea-pearl, he tickled&#xA;the three folds in her mid-riff. Embraced by madhumati the trideva&#xA;looked like the peaks of the Himalayas girt by snow and pine forests.&#xA;The bIjas AM, hrIM, kroM, klIM, huM and oM filled the air. They spread&#xA;the mAyA.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It is filled with the fury&#xA;of rudra mahAdeva. The agni in the midst becomes rudra and the&#xA;sacrificer readies to pacify him. He recites thus:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;rudró vA eShá yád agnís tásya tisráH sharavyAH pratIcI tiráshcy anUcI&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This fire is rudra, three are his missiles, one that strikes straight,&#xA;one transversely, and one that strikes from below (These are the 3 stars&#xA;of Orion, the invakas, which are the 3 arrows fired by rudra slaying&#xA;prajapati).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The shatru senA is as though rushing&#xA;forward when it is suddenly attacked from the flanks by flaming missile&#xA;shot by the agents of rudra. Each bhairava mantra is like a shower of&#xA;fatal arrows raining on them with unstoppable fury.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Meditate upon the Adi-guru, the kShatriya woman, lakShmI~nkarA, who is&#xA;the founder of the lineage of teachers of the lore of the bhairava in&#xA;the kali yuga, the great princess, the sister of the noble rAjan&#xA;indrabhUtI. She is of lotus complexion, of splendid beauty, seated in in&#xA;padmAsana, graced by a crimson tilaka, with her long eyes painted with&#xA;black collyrium, showing the gyAna mudra surrounded by students&#xA;receiving the bhairava vidyA from her. She has condensed the secret&#xA;vidyAs of bhairava of gAlava, vishvAmitra, bhArgava, yamoghaNTa, shUka,&#xA;shikhin and others.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It is here that my ancestors&#xA;through my maternal grandmother roamed, a clan graced with number of&#xA;notable shrauta sacrificers. One of that clan was a well-learned tantric&#xA;had attained siddhi of numerous mantras and was deeply proficient in the&#xA;mantra shAstra. In course of his secular duties he was wending his way&#xA;towards another town, when he came across the spot, where the choLa&#xA;governor of the Telugu country, known by the title, giripaschima-rAja,&#xA;had held his court. During the high reign of the reign of king&#xA;kullotu~Nga, this governor had built a temple of the great deity&#xA;karNamoTini and planted an Acacia tree in the compound. He attained the&#xA;siddhi of the mantras of the deity. The place is now in ruins and in the&#xA;grip of the practioners of adharma. Yet those of the clan that think of&#xA;her see her fiery manifestation completely subduing all before them. The&#xA;learned vaiShNava with whom we conversed in our native city told us of&#xA;his remarkable journey to the most glorious Oddiyana Pitha, where he&#xA;realized that great Mongol adept of the chInAchAra tantras, shri jahana&#xA;vajra khaan had attained a siddhi of her mantra. Moving on to Mongolia&#xA;he saw the idol of shrI mahAdevI karNamoTini and having placed her image&#xA;in his heart he he retraced his path to Oddiyana. In the high sthala of&#xA;Oddiyana meditating on her in the midst of the mountain he attained the&#xA;siddhi of her mantra.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The severed heads of&#xA;viShNu and rudra are seen beside her. The mystic bIja graaaM is&#xA;reverberating all around her. There are the senAs of the lulApamukhas&#xA;around her commanded by the dreaded kAlavAhanavadana. Beside her sits&#xA;her fair daughter rakta-jyeShThA or upa-dhUmrA. Her pArshadhas are&#xA;yelling hideous statements like without shivA, shiva is but a shava.&#xA;Others yell it is not in this jagat. In her hand she holds a large&#xA;terrible shUla.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2005/11/23/musings-on-the-aponaptriya-rite/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The aponaptrIya is an important rite associated with the somayAga and is&#xA;described in detail in the aitareya, the kaushItaki and chAgaleya&#xA;brAhmaNas. The rite seems to be associated with the deities sarasvatI&#xA;and apAM napAt and was probably instituted by kavaSha ailUsha, the&#xA;priest of the pUru king kurushravaNa. Simply told, it is said that the&#xA;other brAhmaNas, the madhymas questioned the legitimacy of kavaSha as a&#xA;brahmin, calling him a cheat and one born through a dAsa&#xA;[proto-Iranian?] mother. They drove kavaSha out in the desert and as&#xA;he departed he composed the hymn “pra devatra brahmaNe..[RV 10.30]”&#xA;and it is said that sarasvatI followed him surrounding him with her&#xA;waters. The madhyamas realizing that he was a great R^ishi favored by&#xA;sarasvati brought him back and had him institute the aponaptrIya rite.&#xA;With these hymns the hotA priest collects water in on the day before the&#xA;sacrifice and this is called the vasatIvarI water. The water collected&#xA;in the morning of the sacrifice is called the ekadhanaA water. The hotA&#xA;then pours these into a goblet with RV 1.83.2 and the adhvaryu mixes&#xA;honey and soma into these waters for the devas. This pouring is supposed&#xA;to aid crushing of the rivals through indra. Then with Rv 1.23.16-18,&#xA;the final pouring of the waters for the water goddess is performed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The following purANas state&#xA;the story:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;brahmANDa 1.2.27&lt;br&gt;&#xA;kUrma 2.37&lt;br&gt;&#xA;skanda 1.1.6, 7.1.187 and other references&lt;br&gt;&#xA;vAmana 22.6.65&lt;br&gt;&#xA;devIbhAgavata 4.20&lt;br&gt;&#xA;shiva 4.12&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The critical version of the core tale as can be reconstructed from the&#xA;above sources goes thus:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2005/10/23/the-fire-hymns-of-the-mongols/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The fire worship of the Hindus is an ancient Indo-European trait that&#xA;was clearly amplified in the Indo-Iranian branch. The primary fire&#xA;priests of the Indo-Aryans are the bhR^igus and and a~Ngirasas who are&#xA;remembered in the old vedic texts. The bhR^igus also known as atharvans&#xA;are also remembered as the founders of the fire worship amongst the&#xA;Iranians. The Iranian word for fire being Atar. One of the interesting&#xA;trends noticed in the Hindu fire worship is personal association of each&#xA;major Aryan clan with the invocation of fire, recaptitulating the way&#xA;their founders did it via the AprI hymns. Beyond the AprIs there are the&#xA;original kindlers of the fire who are remembered as part of the begining&#xA;of the fire rites. This illustrated in the famous formula remembering&#xA;the first of the bhArgavas who kindled the fire. In any regular fire&#xA;sacrifice termed the iShTi, after the rectitation of the 15-fold&#xA;sAmidhenI hymns (pra vo vAja …) the pravara of the yajamAna and his&#xA;founding fathers are recited. Then even as the adhvaryu pours a libation&#xA;of ghee in the fire even as the hotar chants:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The 3 praNavas are&#xA;the AdhAra that is known as the brahman. This is followed by the 3&#xA;tArikAs and the 3 anutArikAs which are two wives of viShNu. They are the&#xA;supremre states with all things existing in these two shaktis of viShNu.&#xA;This sequence represents the primary reality which is the absolute&#xA;puruSha, the shAnta and the nAda that manisfest there after. shrI is an&#xA;intrinsic part of each stage in the form of time manifesting as nimeSha&#xA;and unmesSha.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Perhaps not. The best means of really understanding the evolution of these old doctrines is via comparative analysis with the equivalent Greek works. When I suddenly reflected upon the old tAntric lines:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;kAmesha-gNYAta-saubhAgya-mArdavoru-dvyAnvitA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I saw the power of mahAmAyA, that entity called prakR^iti. I wondered where this stream of thought had emerged from. This took me back to the famed Greek sage Parmenides of Elea. Parmenides was a Pythagorean and a student of Xenophanes. Parmenides was a magician, medicine man and poet who was the founder of a remarkable school of Greek philosophical thought. His thoughts are summed up thus:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The effects of kAma on shiva have been enshrined in the&#xA;highest poetry of saMskR^ita by kAlidAsa in poem on the birth of the&#xA;war-god. But the brahmANDa purANa is unique in providing a version of&#xA;the tale, where kAma has a second attempt to go at shiva and in this&#xA;attempt conquers him. It is one of those eternal pieces of decorative&#xA;prose in Hindu literature. The tale goes thus:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

We decided to&lt;br&gt;&#xA;recall his awful deeds in course of his momentous life that overlapped with the tumult taking place in the bhArata realms.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The yadu was born to vasudeva and devakI, who were imprisoned by kaMsa, devakI’s brother.The tyrant kaMsa had been told that devakI’s 8th son will kill him one day.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;devakI’s eighth son was born on a rohiNI aShtTami, and was spirited away by vasudeva to his cowherd friend nanda’s abode. Instead he brought back nanda’s daughter to replace his son.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;kR^iShNa devakIputra’s possible escape still worried kaMsa so he sent a demoness putanA to slay devakIputra. But kR^iShNa slew pUtana instead.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;kR^iShNa then still a child slew effortlessly demons such as triNavarta, aghAsura and dhenuka.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;kR^iShNa then subdued the nAga chief kaliya on the banks of the yamuna.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;kR^iShNa’s brother balabhadra, son of rohiNi and vasudeva slew the demon pralamba.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;devakIputra then killed the agents of kaMsa like shankachuda, ariSTa, keshi and vyoma.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;then kR^iShNa and balarAma proceeded to the court of kaMsa, at akrUra’s invitation.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;then the brother advanced to the capital of kaMsa, mathura, and were pitted against the wrestlers chANUra and muShTika, whom they promptly slew.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;then kR^iShna killed kaMsa by suddenly attacking him and restored ugrasena on the throne In course of his varied career the mighty bowman vAsudeva killed a number of powerful adversaries of the yadus. He successively destroyed, after killing kaMsa, kAlayavana, naraka the king of pragjyotiSha and his general mura, paundraka the false vAsudeva, jarAsandha via pANDava bhima, shishupAla during the rAjasUya of yuddhiShThira, shalva the great invader, dantavakra and vidhuratha.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

It pervades the tryambaka vidya of the 7th&#xA;maNDala of the R^igveda. It is described as the supreme udyama, foremost&#xA;prANa and all weapons and shaktis of the hordes of viShNu and&#xA;vishvaksena arise from it. Of nArAyaNa modes of activity based on his&#xA;five functions this is the most effective. No single act conducted by&#xA;the supreme viShNu can performed with its aid. This is the sudarshaNa&#xA;disc. The emanation of sudarshaNa starts functioning at the moment of&#xA;the origin of the universe and lakShmi adheres to her chakra-rUpa even&#xA;as nArAyaNa sustains and absorbs creation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2005/05/30/ashvina-stuti/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The adi parvan of the mahAbhArata provides a remarkable “fossilized”&#xA;sUktaM to the ashvins. It comes in the 3rd chapter of the adi parvan&#xA;known as the pauShya section (1.3.60 in the critical Poona edition of&#xA;the mahAbhArata). This section is a particularly interesting in terms of&#xA;retaining some of the archaic structures of the epic, probably coming&#xA;unadulterated from the original form of the jaya epic. Its frame&#xA;narrates the tale of how janamejaya, the kuru emperor, and conqueror of&#xA;takShashIla came to perform his infamous sarpa yaGYa to avenge the&#xA;killing of his father parIkShit by the nAga chief. From this frame bud&#xA;off many archaic tales, one of which is the tale of trial of the sage&#xA;upamanyu of the clan of the vasiShThas. In this tale, upamanyu as a&#xA;young student in the ashrama of his teacher Ayodo dhaumya was&#xA;particularly well-fed in his appearance. dhaumya cuts off his means of&#xA;food, namely from the alms received in the city or from the cows he took&#xA;to graze, by instructing him not to eat or drink any of those things. In&#xA;this state dhaumya asked upamanyu to go and graze his cows. upamanyu&#xA;without any food eats the leaves of the arka plant and as a consequence&#xA;goes blind and falls into a pit while crawling about. Upon seeing his&#xA;absence at sunset that day, dhaumya and his students set out in search&#xA;of upamanyu and call out to him in the pastures. They hear him crying&#xA;out from a pit and mention his blindness. dhaumya asks him to invoke the&#xA;ashvins. He immediately composes a series of R^ichas with which he&#xA;praises the ashvins. As a result they are pleased and give him an apUpa&#xA;cake. upamanyu states that he will eat the cake only after offering it&#xA;to his teacher. They urge upamanyu to do so without offering him, but he&#xA;refuses. Pleased with his devotion they relieve him of his blindness and&#xA;the twin gods also give him a denture of gold, unlike the steel denture&#xA;they had given his teacher dhaumya. As a result dhaumya states that&#xA;upamanyu has passed his trial and blesses him to be a great scholar of&#xA;the vedas and the dharmashAstras.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The one who knows this rahasya and performs the invocation of&#xA;sumukhI along with the great dhUrtasvamI will be favored by them. That&#xA;glorious goddess sumukhI also called the great mahAmayUrI, engaged in&#xA;amorous dalliance with the dhUrta, is described as sulabhAgati. In the&#xA;midst of her yantra, the mate of kArttikeya is meditated as residing and&#xA;invoked with the mighty mantra (in mantra shAstra code):&lt;br&gt;&#xA;karNa ; sanayana dyuti; jarAsana svetesha ; lakShmI ; dirgha nandi ;&#xA;sadR^ik kriya ; samAdhava meSha ; karNo bhR^igu ; sendhikA tandrI ;&#xA;khidevi ma &amp;lt;svayamarupa&amp;gt; ; dIrgha viyat ; pishAchinI &amp;lt;svayamarupa&amp;gt; ;&#xA;himAdrijA ; sarginandajatritayaM.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Hence is he known as&#xA;the roguish dhUrta, who composed the taskara vidyA by manifesting as&#xA;kanakahastin and bhAskaranandin. But even the paths to the attainment of&#xA;chaurya perfection were not straight. amba wanted to slay bhIShma for&#xA;which she received a garland from kumAra but none ever wore it. So she&#xA;had to wait till as shikhaNDin she could wear it herself and slay the&#xA;kuru warrior. Likewise, kAtyAyana could not receive the kaumAra grammar&#xA;till he found the boy who learned things on hearing only once.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The kAlachakra tantra of&#xA;the unclean upachInAchAra stream gives a highly remarkable account of&#xA;the end of the yuga. It’s parallels to the mainstream Hindu version are&#xA;unmistakable and appears to have been clearly derived from it [It is&#xA;even possible that there was a now lost Hindu version which might have&#xA;been a closer precursor of the version in the kAlachakra tantra]. But&#xA;the inspiration for the account from the dreaded Islamic violence is&#xA;very clearly seen and perceived by its author, and incorporated in&#xA;typical prophetic style seen in the purANas (verse 1.150 onwards of the&#xA;kalAchakra tantra). The nature of Islam was clearly understood by these&#xA;bauddha authors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Soon, in the&#xA;core Tantro-Pauranic effloresence he developed a major cult of his own&#xA;and that sugrIva cult eventually became extinct. The tantric cult of&#xA;hanumAn developed as a para-Vaishnava cult and eventually metamorphosed&#xA;into a pan-Indian cult with considerably complexity. This full-blown&#xA;complexity was in place by the CE 1500, though hanumAn was a late&#xA;addition to the Hindu pantheon. He was actually subsuming within him the&#xA;aspect of the vedic vAyu and the maruts (which is linked to his&#xA;description as a son or manifestation of rudra). We discuss briefly&#xA;certain key aspects of ritualism pertaining to the hanumAn cult.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Then we proceeded to the foremost of his shrines in the&#xA;grove of Mayurapuri which has grown decadent as a result of the downward&#xA;turn of the age of kali, eating tasty bhakShaNas that delight the fiery&#xA;one along the way. Having reached the shrine we entered through the gate&#xA;guarded by lakShmI and nArAyaNa. Then we proceeded to see medholka&#xA;accompanied by his two wives siddhi and saMR^iddhi, who are also known&#xA;as madadravA and madanAvatI. Atop his head rests vAsukI, his eyes and&#xA;navel are studded with gems and his trunk is turned left. Having&#xA;worshiped ulka and his wives we proceeded to see the gates guarded&#xA;respectively by umA and rudra, the delightful kAma and ratI, and varAha&#xA;with mahI seated on his lap. Then we saw the 23 idols of vighna and&#xA;pacified him eight times as :&lt;br&gt;&#xA;ekadanta, mahodara, gajAnana, lambodara, vikaTa, vighnarAja, dhumravarNa&#xA;and vakratuNDa, along with his two wives. Then we worshiped the great&#xA;manthAna bhairava who stood at the wall and bhavasharvA. Then we moved&#xA;to see the rat and the peacock of ulka and the vR^iShabha of mahAdeva.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The stotra contains yet another&#xA;example of the classical macrantropic motif that is so pervasive in&#xA;Hindu thought since the puruSha sUktaM and the ashvamedha brAhmaNaM. It&#xA;is full-fledged development was in India and not in Mesopotamia or&#xA;Egypt.

They said, ‘Who shall shoot it?’&#xA;‘Rudra’, they said, ‘Rudra is a fierce (archer), let him shoot it.’ He&#xA;said, ‘Let me choose a wish; let me be overlord of animals.’ Therefore&#xA;is Rudra overlord of animals.

He stirs only when the waters rise and threaten to sink&#xA;the world plane. This shesha is time and hence he is called ananta.&#xA;Thus, when viShNu sleeps on the coils of the great world snake he is&#xA;experiencing the cyclic passage of time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once the great god vAyu and the world snake ananta had a contest of&#xA;strength. shesha wound around the mount meru around which the world&#xA;revolves and vAyu was supposed to dislodge the snake from the great&#xA;mountain. The efforts of mAtarishvan to dislodge the great snake proved&#xA;futile for a long time eventhough the world shook with his terrible&#xA;gusts. Then in fury he uprooted the mount meru snake and all and hurled&#xA;the mountain with great ferocity. Under the impact of vAyu’s blow, meru&#xA;shattered and ananta lost his grip and surrendered. With meru shattered&#xA;the world shook and had no axis. The deva viShNu then stabilized the&#xA;shattered meru it with his foot.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Even as she neared the shrirangaM her father was filled with that inexplicable mixture of joy and sorrow, but she was experiencing unrestrained excitement. As the party reached the temple she jumped out of her palanquin and rushed to the garbhAgR^iha and merged with the 4-handed one in a flash of light.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

They are:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;vinAyaka in the kR^itayuga. 3 demons dhUmrAkSha, narAntaka and&#xA;devAntaka assume great power and spread terror. So gaNapati is born of&#xA;kAshyapa and his wife. He has a 10 handed form with lion vAhana and&#xA;slays these asuras in a great battle at kAshi.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;2)mayureshvara in the tretayuga. A demon called sindhu swallowed a pot&#xA;of amR^ita he had obtained from rudra and became invincible. gaNapati&#xA;assumed a form with 6 hands and captured mayUra a mighty son of vinAta&#xA;and rode him to battle and slew sindhu after making him disgorge the&#xA;amR^ita. It said that he then gave his peacock to his brother kumAra.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

So the rogues and thieves decided to worship the&#xA;great spear-wielding deity who is known to some as son of agni, to&#xA;others as the first born son of the fierce rudra and to yet other as the&#xA;son of the kR^ittikA-s. The chief of the taskara-s accordingly set up a&#xA;well decorated maNDapa and invoked kumAra with the great formulae ending&#xA;in the refrain “&lt;strong&gt;dhurtaM AvAhayAmyahaM&lt;/strong&gt;“. Pleased by the worship the&#xA;six-headed god promised the rogues that their trouble will come to an&#xA;end.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

She&#xA;is the daughter of yama or indra. When grandson of manu was still-born&#xA;he was revived by the great ShaShTi. She is also known as devasenA or&#xA;senA and is worshipped on the shri pa~nchamI, the 5th day after&#xA;dIpAvali. A tarpaNaM performed to her and kumAra with the mantras from&#xA;the bodhAyana dharmasUtra. Usually the tarpaNaM is performed under a&#xA;large ashvatta tree or some other tree. A cat’s face may be draw on a&#xA;cloth or a leaf and left there as to invoke her. Then a cat is offered&#xA;milk as it is the vAhana of ShaShTi and she is supposed to accept&#xA;offerings that form. This day marks her marriage with the great kumAra.&#xA;She is also invoked on the 6th day after the birth of a child to keep&#xA;away the awful agents of her husband from obliterating the child. She is&#xA;accordingly invoked in the Ayushya homa performed for safe-guarding the&#xA;lives of kids. She is worshipped by thieves and knaves on the 6th day of&#xA;the waning moon for success in thievery. Another important rite of&#xA;ShaShTi is the AraNya ShaShTi that is performed around May-June during&#xA;the first 6th digit of the waxing moon. The rite is usually done under a&#xA;kadamba tree in a forest, where an idol of ShaShTi may be installed.&#xA;Then oblations are offered in the fire with the AraNya sUktaM of the&#xA;R^ig veda and then a tarpaNaM for kumAra and devasenA is done. An&#xA;oblation is also offered to the mAtrika lohitAyani, a female gaNa of&#xA;kuMAra. Then food is left for a fishing cat or a lynx and women are&#xA;given a thread to wear around their wrist.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

For this he acquired the pApa of&#xA;brahmahatyA and had to perform the kApAlika vrata. He moved on to slay&#xA;vishvaksena, the chief gaNa of viShNu and was finally purified of brahma&#xA;hatyA after drinking the blood of viShNu.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It was a huge ghost of the &lt;strong&gt;Khais&lt;/strong&gt; variety that may assume the form of a Meccan demon or a Mohammedan. When I was sleeping one night near my sheep the Khais came and pulled my leg. I was afraid and said f**k you, who is pulling at me. I woke up but could not see anything. Next morning I went to take bath at the river. I took off my clothes and went into the water. When I sprinkled myself with water the Khais pushed me into water. I said to myself f**k you, who is pushing me. Somehow I finished my bath and came out. Then I milked the sheep, washed my hands and ate some &lt;strong&gt;bhAkrI&lt;/strong&gt;. Then I took my staff and drove he sheep to the pasture. Then my body began to ache. I had hired a couple of herders to graze my 200-300 sheep. I called my herders and asked them to look after the sheep saying that I could not go on as I needed to sleep. I went to a raised platform where rice had been laid out to dry. I laid down my dhoti and went to sleep under the platform. I slept from 12 noon to 4 in the afternoon. Then I got up and slowly headed to our tent. When I got there darkness was closing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

They may feel that they&#xA;are floating in air and feel the constant sensation of being pursued by&#xA;someone while walking. A women, even if of great beauty will simply not&#xA;be looked at by any man, when possessed by the vinAyakas. Men even if&#xA;rich or handsome will simply fail to get a woman. Married women will go&#xA;sterile and children will die. A kshatriya will lose his post or kingdom&#xA;even if he has good qualifications.

On account of her mAya, the great god viShNu lay in slumber when the plane was submerged in the waters at the end of the kalpa. There arose from the wax in his ears two terrible daityas, madhu and kaiTabha. They rapidly advanced to slay brahmA when mahAkAli in order to awaken viShNu arose from his forehead and departed. viShNu having awoken fought the daityas in a relentless battle for 5000 years. At the end of it, under mahAkAli’s delusion the daityas sought a boon from vishNu. As the whole plane lay submerged in the waters, the daityas asked the boon that viShNu could only kill them in the spot where there was no water. viShNu granted it to them. He immediately raised the daityas to his thighs and beheaded them with the chakra.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The English word God may to a hindu mean either a deity (&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deva_%28Hinduism%29&#34;&gt;dEvatA&lt;/a&gt;) or that which pervades everything (&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahman&#34;&gt;brahman&lt;/a&gt;) (both of which are distinct from the Abrahamist notion of a true God). This leads to confusion while talking to Hindus. Hindu-s have a stronger need (because of unique conditioning) for distinguishing deva from brahman compared to say Egyptians or Japanese. So, their tendency to take God to mean brahman is quite understandable.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I first became aware of the group of Hindu goddesses known as the ten Mahavidyas while conducting research on the goddess Kali in Calcutta during the academic year 1968-69. Kali is nearly always listed as the first of this group often unusual goddesses and in many ways is the exemplary Mahavidya. It was not until 1983-84 in Varanasi, however, that I began to undertake detailed research on this group. With the help of a fellowship from the Canadian Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council, I investigated literary sources and did field research on Mahavidya temples, iconography, and worship. I returned to Varanasi in 1992-93 to continue my research, this time with the help of a grant from McMaster University Arts Research Board.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Although possession as a religious and sociocultural phenomenon in ancient and classical India has been understudied, in fact rarely mentioned in the secondary literature (to a great extent because it has been regarded as absent in the primary literature),1 the opposite is the case for modern India, for which studies of possession abound. Indeed, it is no exaggeration to say that possession is one of the most studied topics in anthropology and is beginning to find its way into the academic study of religion.2 Its attractiveness as a subject of study is often due to its exotic character (which is to say its spiritual distance from academe), its evident irrational Otherness, and its frequent presence in ritual. Caroline Humphrey and James Laidlaw, who have studied possession and exorcism among largely educated middle-class people at the Padampura Jain temple near Jaipur, assert, “Ethnographers have displayed an almost puzzle-solving pleasure in ‘decoding’ rituals: the more bizarre and serpentine the better. Behind this lies the idea that rituals contain hidden messages about the societies in which they are performed.”3 This, they believe, is the consuming passion of anthropologists; yet they see the scholar’s analysis of ritual (especially that in which possession is contextualized) as usually neglecting the participant’s view. This emic viewpoint is something I attempt to engage in this volume, as a parallel discourse to the etic viewpoints that constitute and regulate contemporary academics (though one may argue that the practice of an etic discourse in thinking about the Other is simultaneously the practice of an emic discourse within the tribe of scholars).4 Conferring at least limited credibility to emic viewpoints is, in my experience of contemporary scholarship (in opposition to Humphrey and Laidlaw’s observation), finding an increasingly prominent place in more recent studies of possession. Furthermore, in defense of those of us who study possession (including Humphrey and Laidlaw), it must be said that public performance of possession is nearly always thrilling and exotic for those who are enculturated. Thus anthropologists and other observers and researchers must not be faulted too severely for yielding to that same odd attractiveness, for succumbing to the spell of possession.5&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Corpses are remarkably often associated with the Mahavidyas, and cremation grounds seem to be highly favored as places in which to worship them. Kali, Tārā, Bagalamukhi, Tripura-sundari, Matarigi, and Bhairavi are all said to stand or sit upon corpses. Kali, Tārā, Chinnamasta, and Dhumavati are often described or pictured as dwelling in cremation grounds. On several occasions the *Mantra-mahodadhih *stipulates that *sadhand *(spiritual endeavor) should be done while sitting on a corpse or on a place where a corpse has recently been buried. For example, in an almost matter-of-fact way, the text says: &amp;ldquo;Bringing a corpse on a Tuesday or Saturday, . . . bury it one foot deep in the ground beneath the door of the house. Then, sitting on that spot, . . . perform 108 Japas [repetitions] every day. . . . Through such a Japa for eight days the *[sadhaka, *&amp;ldquo;adept&amp;rdquo;] becomes the lord of various Siddhis [&amp;ldquo;perfections,&amp;rdquo; magical powers].&amp;ldquo;1 The same text, again, instructs the *sadhaka *as follows: &amp;ldquo;Sitting on a Savasana [a corpse seat] . . . the Sadhaka should begin the Japa at sunrise and continue it without break till the next sunrise.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the present study we examine possession as a descriptor for a kind or class of mood, as a mechanism of divine creation, as a possible consequence of the consumption of soma, as a factor in disease production, as part of the job description of the gandharva and other semidivine beings, as ordnance in the arsenal of accomplished yogins, and as a mode of devotion. What sets these portrayals apart from representations of possession in texts we examine here is that they were assumed by the authors of the various genres we have examined so far (Vedas, Purāṇas, Sanskrit epics, Yoga texts, Tantras, medical literature, and so on) to abide in a kind of facticity based on the interplay of myth, historical event, discourse mode, and didactic intent. This presumption held its ground even when the possession episodes in question were knowingly and unabashedly embellished as part of a literary enterprise. To cite two examples, the hagiographical rendering of Śaṅkara’s possession was lifted almost entirely from earlier fictional tales, as was the story of the possession by darkness of King Purañjana.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;THE WRITING OF THIS VOLUME TOOK ME BY SURPRISE. I never envisaged it as part of my “research program” until it began to form a life of its own. Eventually, it grew from childhood to adolescence and, typical of adolescence, began to exact unreasonable demands on my resources, including time, place, and modes of thought. Having now achieved maturity, it demands to be set free. On the whole, I would have preferred to be in India translating Sanskrit and examining manuscripts, rather than working on a project like this that imposed on me a new and very different set of intellectual, psychic, and even physical demands. As it turned out, I was forced to examine worlds of thought and theory that I had always suspected lay in wait, less quietly than I appreciated, to ensnare me, while the project unceasingly transgressed boundaries I kept setting on it. Its conception and infancy—I thoughtlessly intended to abandon it in childhood—took the form of papers delivered at annual meeting of the American Academy of Religion in 1992, the American Oriental Society in 1993, and the Indic Seminar at Columbia University in 1994. My intention in these papers was to examine a few of the semantic issues surrounding some of the key terms for possession that I saw repeated in Sanskrit texts of many different periods and genres. I foolishly believed that I could accomplish this in ten, twenty, or thirty pages. Soon enough, however, I discovered the vast ethnographic literature of possession in India and became almost hopelessly entangled—and gridlocked—in the theoretical issues surrounding it. This is discussed in due course, but I must confess here that my reading of possession in modernity had a much greater impact on my reading of possession in antiquity than I had expected or desired. Instead of a paper on possession in antiquity—the initial scope of the project—this has become a work more generally on possession in South Asian culture over a long span of time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Indian devotional (bhakti) literature is one of the most prominent genres for discussion of āveśa and allied notions of divine or oracular possession. Vallabhācārya (1479–1531) provides an epitome of this in his commentary on the Bhāgavata-Purāṇa (BhP 10.27.24),1 entitled “Subodhinī.” Vallabhācārya writes: bhagavadāveśo hi sarvajñatā bhavati (one who is in a state of divine possession becomes omniscient). Bhakti literature is also the most prominent locus for discussion of the aesthetics of possession, a topic that Vallabhācārya and his followers, as well as the Vaiṣṇava disciples of Śrī Caitanya, take up in full. The underlying bhakti context for these notions is established in the Bhagavad-Gītā (BhG), where Kṛṣṇa asserts that those whose “minds are absorbed in me” (mayy āveśya manaḥ; 12.2) are the best among yogins (yuktatamāḥ).2 Furthermore, Kṛṣṇa adds that he saves from the cycle of death and rebirth those whose “thoughts are absorbed in me” (mayy āveśya cetasām; 12.7).3 Later bhakti texts explicitly or implicitly follow the Gitā. For example, in the BhP Uddhava addresses Kṛṣṇa, in a statement that could easily be multiplied, “You, O Master, have said that the discipline of devotion [bhaktiyogaḥ], by which the mind, after eliminating all attachment, enters [āviśet] into you, is independent [of other disciplines]” (11.14.2). Bhakti theologians elaborate these statements, eventually expanding the domain of āveśa to include absorption in ontological states within the broad boundaries of saṃsāra, as well as in specified experiential states.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Caraka-Saṃhitā, the oldest of the major āyurvedic texts,1 mentions three kinds of therapy (cikitsā): daivavyapāśraya (spiritual), yuktivyapāśraya (rational), and sattvāvajaya (psychological).2 Regardless of readily available (and well-known) definitions of these terms in canonical āyurvedic texts, practicing physicians most often quote the following Sanskrit verse as a prelude to any discussion of the treatment of mental illness, including those diagnosed as caused or exacerbated by spirit possession:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;janmāntarakṛtam pāpaṃ vyādhirūpeṇa jāyate |&lt;br&gt;&#xA;tacchāntair aushadhaiḥ dānaiḥ japahomārcanādibhiḥ ||&lt;br&gt;&#xA;When it takes the form of disease, a moral transgression effected in another birth may be overcome through rituals of pacification [śānta], medicines [auṣadha], gift giving [dāna], repetition of the name of god [japa], fire offerings [homa], temple offerings [arcana], etc.3&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The vedic literature from the Ṛgveda (ṚV) to the classical Upaniṣads is the earliest source of information on possession in India. It is also among the most unambiguous. Because one of the principal arguments of this book is that there is a recognizable “tradition” of possession in India, it is necessary to say a few words about the early relationship between the folk and the classical as this bears greatly on any allegation of a tradition widely regarded as an experiential phenomenon with a popular discourse that largely bypasses ancient and classical literature. I say this in spite of all the evidence adduced in the following chapters, because most of these texts, or at least the passages cited in them, exist on the periphery of mainstream classical literature, by which I here mean śāstra.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Variants of the Sanskrit āveśa and grahaṇa appear widely distributed in regional Indian languages. The unexpectedly late semantic conflation of √gṛh with ā√viś in Sanskrit is seen in several Middle Indo-Aryan languages contemporaneous with such usages in Sanskrit texts from the last few centuries of the first millennium C.E., which in turn set the stage for the all but interchangeable use of these verbs in New Indo-Aryan. In Hindi, āveś in the early Sanskritic senses of pervasion, absorption, and entry has been completely superseded. In addition to spirit possession, which is also a common meaning for the Hindi verbs caḍhnā (“to climb or mount,” hence its sexual connotations; “to become possessed”) and khelnā (to play) (cf. below, Marathi kheḷ,4 Panjabi kheḍnā,5 and Bengali khelā6), āveś discloses the senses of “charge, agitation, intense emotion, frenzy, wrath.”7 Erndl reports the use of the Hindi verb khelnā as illustrating the sense of possession as play, more specifically, the play of the deity with the person possessed. “When a woman is possessed, the goddess is said to take on a ‘wind form’ [pavan rūp], enter her, and ‘play’ within her.”8 Some of the terms for possession noted by K. P. Shukla, who conducted a sociological study of traditional healers in rural areas near Varanasi in 1969–71, are havā lagnā (to feel a breeze), pher (turn, curvature), kisī ne kucch kar (or de) dīyā hai (giving someone something, doing something to someone; probably indicating black magic).9 Ann Gold notes the term bhāv ānā (a feeling is coming) used in Rajasthan,10 while Beatrix Pfleiderer and Lothar Lutze note jāgar (waking [the deity]).11 Ruth and Stanley Freed note bhūt kī bīmārī (spirit illness), bhūt grasth (ghost possessed), and bhūt lagnā (attacked by a ghost).12&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In a list of fifty-one goddesses in the *Mahakala-samhita, *nine of the ten Mahavidyas are mentioned, Dhumavati alone being absent. This text has been dated as early as the tenth century C.e. and may be the earliest mention of the Mahavidyas as a group. *Mahdkdla-samhita *(Allahabad: Ganganath Jha Research Institute, 1974), Kamakala-khanda, pp. 65-66. Six of the ten Mahavidyas—Kali, Tārā, Matarigi, Bhairavl, Chinnamasta, and Dhumavati—are described in *upa **tantras, *small sections dealing with each goddess, in the *Sammoha-tantra, *which was probably written in the fifteenth century. Prabodh Chandra Bagchi, *Studies **in **the **Tantras *(Calcutta: University of Calcutta, 1975), p. 101.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;***The **Black **Goddess ***&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;She is the terrible one who has a dreadful face. She should be meditated upon as having disheveled hair and a garland of freshly cut human heads. She has four arms. In her upper left hand she holds a sword that has just been bloodied by the severed head that she holds in her lower left hand. Her upper right hand makes the gesture of assurance and her lower right hand, the sign of granting favors. She has a bluish complexion and is lustrous like a dark cloud. She is completely naked, and her body gleams with blood that is smeared all over it from the garland of bleeding severed heads around her neck. Her ear ornaments are the corpses of children. Her fangs are dreadful, and her face is fierce. Her breasts are large and round, and she wears a girdle made of severed human hands. Blood trickles from the corners of her mouth and makes her face gleam. She makes a terrible sound and lives in the cremation ground, where she is surrounded by howling jackals. She stands on the chest of Siva in the form of a corpse. She is eager to have sexual intercourse in reverse fashion with Mahakala. She wears a satisfied expression. She smiles.1&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Brown 1997.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Nor does it resemble the trance states experienced by contemporary charismatic or Pentacostal groups. These states have vague resonances with the possession found at Jejuri and other mass possession sites. However, I cannot consider them here.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;For an account of this festival as it occurs in Penang, see Collins 1997, whose theoretical perspective is quite different from that of others, and well worth noting. See my discussion of this in Smith 2001a. For a discussion of the experience of possession during the Thaipusam festival, along with a complementary study of its physiological correlates, see Simons et al., 1988.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cf. Gellner 1994:211f.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Goodheart 2001:13.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cf. Morris 2000 for the possession of royalty long dead in Thailand. This is also common in Africa; see the relevant articles in Behrend and Luig 1999.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cf. Behrend 1999.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;This is a major theme in Morris’s study of possession and modernity in northern Thailand; see Morris 2000:332. See also the remarks of Faure, in Chapter 1, n. 28.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Macdonald (1975) reminds us of just how remote most of Nepal remained, at least in the 1960s, and likely remains today. In the mid-twentieth century, 75 percent of Nepalese had never visited a doctor, thus depended for their health care on local healers and shamans.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Erndl 1997:23.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;For Africa, see Behrend and Luig 1999 and Sharp 1993. For the islands of the Pacific basin, see Mageo and Howard 1996 (also my review of these books, Smith 2001a). For Cambodia, see Bertrand 2004. For Sri Lanka, see Lawrence 2003 and Chapter 4 herein. Nabokov sees the same phenomenon in South India: “Over this century South India has undergone a revival of devotional fervor (bhakti) first popularized by the Tamil poets and saints between the seventh and the ninth centuries. Increased participation in practices such as firewalking, flesh piercing, and pilgrimage have moved devotee to experience deities directly, intimately, and intensely” (2000:16). The possession described in the New York Times in November 2000 (see above, p. 40) is not considered oracular, at least not by the Catholic Church, which is attempting to eradicate it through exorcism. Nevertheless, the Church does recognize its recent increase.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;See Mark Taylor on Huntington’s remarks on the connection between Westernization and modernization and the eventual backlash against the former in non-Western societies (1998:5f. on Huntington 1996:75f.).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cf. Paper 1995:117ff. For more recent information on the Mediums’ Association in Taiwan and its practices, see Tsai 2003, 2004. See Davis 2001 on the number of spirit-mediums per capita in Song-dynasty China. “These numbers are not small,” he states.&#xA;In Hongzhou [Nanchang, Jiangxi], for example, nineteen hundred spirit mediums were rounded up in the early eleventh century, which produces a ratio of one spirit-medium for every 135 families; in Chuzhou [Zhejiang], there were thirty-seven hundred spirit-medium households in the prefecture of the late eleventh century, and therefore one medium household for every 24 families; and in Fujian … [there were] four or five spirit-medium households for every village! (p. 62)&#xA;It is impossible to adduce data that can provide any figures for classical (or contemporary) South Asia.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;For example, a possessed medium mounts a throne in order to become a cakkavartin (world-turning monarch); cf. Morris 2000:115.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Morris 2000:89; for an extended description of and commentary on the Praise Ceremony, see pp. 107ff.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;One channeled book, Conversations with God: Book 1, by Neale Donald Walsch, was on the New York Times bestsellers’ list for more than three years in the late 1990s. Walsch alleges to have channeled God himself, not a spirit, angel, or minor deity. It is apparently of great comfort to millions that God gives good, commonsensical, and very general advice.&#xA;The degree to which trance channeling has entered the American consciousness (and the general level of seriousness with which it is taken) can also be seen by the following headline “YANKEES LEAD SERIES, 3–2. WELLS CHANNELS BABE RUTH TO KEEP CURSE ALIVE” in the New York Times, on the first page of the sports section, October 15, 2003. This is not altogether distant from the parody in Chapter 8 in our discussion of the Bhagavadajjukāprahasana, a drama written in the seventh century.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Sontheimer notes that in Maharashtra it is not the most respectable mode of earning a livelihood: “The rather unclassical folk-religious forms of bhakti are hierarchised: e.g., hook-swinging is rākṣasī bhakti, the possession by the god and making a living on it is styled pisacï bhakti, and feeding a Brahmān, who has to be imagined to be a form of Mārtaṇḍa Bhairava, is called sāttvikī bhakti and is the highest form of bhakti” (1995:136).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;See Gellner 1994; also Höfer 1974:163–164.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Melton et al. 1990:xiii.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;See Desjarlais 1992, ch. 1, for the author’s interesting and reflective account of his shamanic initiation in Nepal in 1988.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;See Hanegraaf 1998:23ff. He states further that channeling “is an emic term used in the New Age context to refer to the general etic category of ‘articulated revelations.’ It is no more and no less than that. The attempt to present channeling as an etic term must be dismissed as an apologetic strategy for convincing the public of the validity of New Age trance channeling” (p. 27). For “articulated revelations,” see pp. 24ff.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The commentator on the love poem Amaruśataka informs us that Śaṇkara wrote this while stationed in Amaruka’s body. It is virtually certain, however, that Śaṇkara did not write the Amaruśataka.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A few scholars, notably Elizabeth-Chalier Visuvalingam (1989) and Sunthar Visuvalingam (1989), have overplayed the idea of the transgressive in Indian religious and spiritual practices. A transgressive practice is not necessarily extrainstitutional, especially in Indian popular religion, where “institutional” boundaries are shadowy at best.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;See Solomon (1995), who rightly notes: “there is no reason—certainly no a priori reason—to suppose that emotions are the same the world over” (p. 255). For more on this topic see Chapter 8.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Brown 1997:38ff.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;In my own classes in “Comparative Religious Ritual” at the University of Iowa, I have shown Alf Hiltebeitel’s documentary film “Lady of Gingee,” produced while conducting research for his Draupadī volumes. During one scene a participant in possession bites off the head of a rooster and drinks its blood. Despite many noteworthy features of this film, this scene is often the only one that students remember. Although the scene is surely striking, it is disorienting and memorable for most American students because to them religiosity is not supposed to be expressed like this. For a photo of a “yakka-dancer” biting through the throat of a sacrificed cock, see Wirz 1954:56, plate VIII; see also Nabokov 2000:160, where the head of a chicken is bitten off, followed by the severing of the head of a goat with a single stroke of a sword and the impalement of a pig with a long spear piercing the throat. Hiltebeitel (1991) often addresses the theme of impalement as a feature of possession. The theme also occurs in Bengal; see Korom 1992:252ff.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;See Sontheimer 1965 on the legal personality of Hindu deities.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Wagle (1995) describes the legal procedure for verification, called paḍthal, in which various gods were consulted to pronounce judgment on spirits. Sometimes this was done through a medium, sometimes through other forms of divination. “The bhūt problem,” writes Wagle, “must have reached crisis proportions in the districts of southern Koṇkaṇ in the mid-1770s” (p. 191). A special constabulary was established with a designated officer and six assistants from the central government of the Peshwe’s who traveled through the area investigating and controlling bhūt cases, then levying fines of between 25 and 50 rupees.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;For example, the Ugandan Alice Auma of the spirit Lakwena; cf. Behrend 1999.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I am grateful to Michael Wright, a resident of the community headed by J. Z. Knight (Ramtha), in Yelm, Washington, for this clarification.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;But see Sontheimer 1965 on the degrees to which deities are said to be alive in Indian legal theory, their ability to accept gifts, the deity as a juristic entity, and the historical role of Mīmāṃsā in mediating such cases.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Brown 1997:156ff., 187ff.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;See ibid.: 194–195; a particularly good Web site is &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.trancechanneling.com&#34;&gt;www.trancechanneling.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ibid.:130.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;See, e.g., Sharp 1993.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Brown 1997:182.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Another related comparative study was conducted by Jakobsen (1999), who discovered that urban neoshamanistic course participants more often than not practice shamanic behavior without actually mastering the spirits, which Shirokogoroff discovered is one of the important aspects of traditional shamanism (see above, pp. 63–64).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;</description>

      <title>01 Possession as Yoga Practice</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Possession is mentioned in the third adhyāya of Patañjali’s Yogasūtms (YS), the chapter dealing with extraordinary powers (vibhūti, siddhi) gained through the practice of yoga. YS 3.38 reads: “Due to loosening the cause of bondage and from full knowledge of [the mechanics of psychic] movement, entrance [āveśa] of one’s mind [citta] into another’s body [becomes possible]” (bandhakāraṇaśaithilyāt pracārasaṃvedimāc ca cinasya paraśarīrāveśaḥ).3 The primary commentator on the YS, Vyāsa, believes that the cause (kāmṇa) of bondage in the form of the repository of one’s accumulated actions (karmāśaya) is loosened by the power of samādhi. It is the evaporation of the natural bondage of the siddha or accomplished yogin to objects of perception that allows the citta—thought or the power of mind—to flow into the body (and mind) of another person, regardless of the extent to which the other individual is caught in the grip of his or her or her own perceptual universe and karmic web.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;caveat&#34;&gt;Caveat&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Tantra is a category increasingly subject to debate. It is now regarded by many of the most informed scholars as a category with vague characterization and definition, an amorphous medley of practices, rites, and doctrines that became tantric by attrition; they simply do not fit elsewhere.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This, combined with a Western fascination for things tantric (especially a mistaken identification of Tantra with sex), enables most nonspecialists to dodge the problem of Tantra.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ethnographic work at the beginning of the twentieth century, which has been supplemented and revitalized during the past forty years, shows that spirit or deity possession is a widespread epstēmē—a historically situated discourse, phenomenon, and practice—in Indian thought, culture, religion, and medicine.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; However, if our knowledge of the subject were limited to the accounts of classical Indologists and others who have privileged the “high” intellectual and religious traditions while eschewing the history of actual religious practice, we would scarcely know of the existence of this phenomenon, much less its pervasiveness. One might say that it is the “ism” of Hinduism, the Hinduism essentialized by its most literate propagators and translators that has nullified and delegitimized its breathtakingly broad spectrum of popular practice, including possession.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; More specifically, non- or scant recognition of possession in premodern India has been due to a longstanding aversion among educated Judeo-Christians as well as educated Hindus, for whom possession has fallen outside the realm of both reason and social accountability.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Perhaps the most common perception—and consequent stigmatization—of possession among both academic and indigenous orthodoxies is that it is a nettlesome aberration, a blemish on the face of epistemological order, a phenomenon subject to benign neglect, or, at most, sanitized into nonrecognition. To whatever degree this perception is borne out by taxonomies in both Sanskrit and regional languages that distinguish various loci and states of possession (a topic dealt with extensively below), the more important point is that possession and, indeed, emotion itself, the kinder, gentler ancestor of possession, have been considered to bear the stigma of primitivism:&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; they are associated with people of lower social rank, including low castes, tribals, and women,&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; or more generally with those lacking literacy, the great (and, before modern times, extremely rare) tool generally believed capable of bestowing introspection, self-knowledge, and control.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Therefore, discussion of it has been avoided or denounced by the self-conceived (and, by no accident, highly literate) orthodox among both scholars and indigenous practitioners. And among scholars, even when this stigma has not been inflicted, possession as the exclusive property of lower-ranking individuals has been assumed so casually as to preclude a search for it among other groups and individuals. Even the eminent sociologist Louis Dumont declares possession a “mystic ecstasy … which so far we have not encountered at a learned level.”&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The present study aims to rectify these shortcomings.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-vocabulary-of-possession-in-the-mbh&#34;&gt;The Vocabulary of Possession in the MBh&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Minoru Hara has scoured the MBh for occurrences of ā√viś, ostensibly to shed light on the term śraddhāviveśa (possessed by faith) in the Kaṭha Upaniṣad (1.2).3 Indeed, his focus is more on the MBh than on the Upaniṣads, saving the present author considerable labor. He lists sixty semantic contexts in which ā√viś is found in the MBh, in verbal, nominal, and adjectival form. It is clear from Hara’s study that āveśa was a popular and highly developed notion in the MBh. Certain nuances of the word developed more fully later, for example, in tantric and bhakti texts, but its use as a signifier of intense emotional engagement, a specified ontological condition, mental state, or psychological attitude was fully manifested by the time the MBh was redacted. This range of signification has been sustained in Sanskritic and vernacular discourse ever since, a fact that may be attributed to the continuity of the two epics in local and regional culture, including their narrative progression, themes, motifs, moods, and language.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Himalayan Śaiva and Buddhist Tantras that mention svasthāvesa are primarily dedicated to descriptions of the worship of Śiva and various goddesses. The Śaiva texts fall within a class called Siddhānta, rather than under the better-known but highly suspect designation “Kashmir Saivism.”3 Thus, the texts are not the commonly cited ones (by Abhinavagupta, Kṣemarāja, Utpaladeva, and their predecessors), but the lesser-known Jayadrathayāmala, Tantrasadbhāva, Sekoddeśa, Niśvāsaguhya, Bṛhatkālottara, and Cakrasaṃvarapiṇḍārtha.4 None of these except the Sekoddesa has been edited or published;5 the remaining ones exist in manuscript form only and have been examined almost solely by Alexis Sanderson.6 These texts undoubtedly represent but a few of what must have been a much greater number of Sanskrit texts that mentioned this and other similar apotropaic rituals current at the time. What is striking about svasthāvesa, and what occupies us here in part, is the remarkable continuity of these texts with certain early Chinese Buddhist tantric texts cited by Edward L. Davis in his recent volume Society and the Supernatural in Song China and Michel Strickmann in Mantras et Mandarins and, much more extensively, in Chinese Magical Medicine,7 as well as in later manuscripts written in Sanskrit and mixed Sanskrit and Telugu in South India dating to perhaps seven or eight centuries later.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The order in which the Mahavidyas are given varies somewhat, as do the goddesses included in the group. In contemporary sources, however, the following goddesses in the following order are most common: (1) Kali, (2) Tārā, (3) Tripura-sundari (Sodasi), (4) Bhuvanesvari, (5) Chinnamasta, (6) Bhairavi, (7) Dhumavati, (8) Bagalāmukhī, (9) Matangi, and (10) Kamala. The ten are described in most sources as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Kali is black, which in fact is what her name means. She has a fierce countenance, stands on the supine body of the god Siva, and has four arms. Her upper left hand holds a bloodied cleaver and her lower left hand a severed head. Her right upper hand makes the sign &amp;ldquo;fear not,&amp;rdquo; and her lower right hand makes the gesture of bestowing boons. She is naked, apart from a garland of severed heads and a girdle of severed arms; her hair is unbound and disheveled; and she is often standing in a cremation ground or on a battlefield. She is almost always mentioned as the first of the Mahavidyas and occupies a preeminent place in the group. In some texts and in some settings, the other Mahavidyas are understood to arise from her and to be her different forms.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Having worked our way through this whirlwind tour—this grand if sometimes bewildering tapestry of Indic literature and ethnography, emotions big and small, ritual formations, health and disease, initiatory trauma and transformation, and much more—we now offer reactions and a few conclusions. First, however, summary descriptions of various kinds of possession are in order. Possession may be destructive (Kali possessing Nala and childsnatchers invading the bodies of pregnant women), instructional (the possession by gandharvas of the daughter and wife of Patañcala Kāpya in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad (BĀU) in what must have been a semipublic séance, and Śaṅkara’s possession of the dead king in order to obtain knowledge of erotics and defeat Ubhayabhāratī, the wife of Maṇḍana Misra, in debate), healing or unifying (possession by Soma, transfer of essences described in the Upaniṣads, tantric śaktipāta initiation), protective (Vipula Bhārgava possessing Ruci), symptomatic of perfected devotion (the līlāveśa or bhagavadāvesa of Vallabhācārya and Rūpa Gosvāmī), a tool used by advanced yogins to influence others (Yogasūtras, Brahmasūtras), or indicative of a state of immersion in erotic love, in the cycle of rebirth, in the Lord’s love games, or even in the Lord’s very body (again bhagavadāveśa, saṃsārāveśa, līlāveśa). When humans possess others, as in the case of Vipula Bhārgava or Śaṅkara, the purpose is viewed as benign. It is regarded similarly when the possessing agent is a substance, an abstraction, or an essence (soma, medhas, etc.). When negative spirits (bhuta, piśāca, etc.) are the agents of possession, it is considered destructive. But when the agent is a semidivine being with a preponderance of good qualities, such as a gandharva, ambiguous results are weighted toward the positive.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After explorations of the ethnography and linguistics of possession in (mostly) postclassical South Asia, we turn to the Sanskrit texts. First, we consider the extensive evidence for possession and models of thought based on possession in the vedic literature (Chapter 5). References to possession begin in the Ṛgveda itself, where we first encounter the word āveśa (and other forms derived from the root ā√viś) in the ninth maṇḍala, the book that includes most of the soma hymns. It is significant that āveśa is the most commonly attested word for “possession” in the Ṛgveda through Classical Sanskrit and Middle-Indic languages down to modern times, where it has found its way into most Modern Indo-Aryan and Dravidian languages. I argue that the vedic soma drinkers experienced (at least in part) a type of divine possession. The word āveśa occurs in nearly all vedic texts, with a preponderance in texts of the early and middle vedic periods. +++(4)+++&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The history of bhūtavidyā can be extended back to the early vedic period, in which, in the Ṛgveda (ṚV), the gods (deva, sura) were distinguished from their archenemies (asura, dānava), and in which the battle between the gods and demons was eternally fought, often to a standstill, though with a slight, if temporary, advantage to the gods. The ṚV identifies other categories of ethereal beings as well, who opposed humanity rather than the gods. In form they were anthropomorphic but, like the gods, insubstantial or, more accurately, endowed with a different substantiality. Among the most important of these beings were the gandharva, rakṣas, yātu or yātudhāna, and, later, the piśāca.10&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The definition of possession cited earlier by Boddy in her review article on the literature of possession has the advantage of both conceptual precision and elasticity. This definition bears repeating. Possession, Boddy says, is a broad term referring to an integration of spirit and matter, force, or power and corporeal reality, in a cosmos where the boundaries between an individual and her environment are acknowledged to be permeable, flexibly drawn, or at least negotiable.7&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Along with the Vedas and the two Sanskrit epics, the Tantras provide the richest sources for the phenomenology of religious possession in premodern India, and, along with the Mahābhārata (MBh) the richest sources for its analysis. Indeed, it is evident that the Tantras, particularly those of the Śaiva and Sākta sects of Kashmir and northeastern India that developed around the turn of the first millennium C.E., confront the issue of possession and problematize it more concretely than anywhere else in Sanskrit literature. The Tantras of both the dualistic Śaiva Siddhānta and the nondualistic Trika and Pratyabhijña Śaiva sects of Kashmir address possession practically and philosophically, domesticating it ritually and conferring on it philosophical credibility, apparently sensitive to its historical prominence as a popular and legitimate mode of religious experience and expression.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Possession comes into its own as a literary motif with accompanying procedural specificity in the Mahābhārata, a subject addressed in Chapter 6. Among the possession stories in this great epic are&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;the well-known tale of Nala’s possession by Kali;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;another in which Vipula Bhārgava protected Ruci, the wife of his guru, Devaśarman, against the sexual advances of the notorious womanizer Indra by entering (anupravisya) the body of Ruci through his yoga-power;+++(5)+++&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;the account in the Sauptikaparvan of Asvatthaman’s destructive possession by Rudra/śiva;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;and the account near the end of the epic in which Vidura, an incarnation of Dharma, employs his yogic abilities to leave his own body, permanently, and enter that of Yudhiṣṭhira. +++(4)+++&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Although the Mahābhārata contains many stories in which possession is central, the other Sanskrit epic, the Rāmāyaṇa, frequently refers to possession as a dimension of intense emotion but has few stories in which it is central. Thus the nexus of possession and emotion appears fully developed in the epics, a feature that characterizes Indic possession from that point on. Countless narrative passages in the epics and later literature describe extreme anger, love, anxiety, concern, or faith in terms of possession.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>02 Meditation on personhood</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After several years, at first intermittently, of data gathering and absorbing stories of possession, then reading and reflecting on theories of possession, and finally engaging it actively, I have arrived, with this book, at a meditation, a perilously intimate one, on personhood, which is sometimes, though not always, contiguous with selfhood. As the title of the book suggests, I find myself attempting to reconcile in this project the self, possessed, with a presentable veneer of self-possession. In this way, the final product has also become a meditation on embodiment and incarnation, gain and loss, transformation and transition, and tradition and imagination, which, my friend Robert Beer reminds me, “must become the same thing” (1988:9). However it began—and the raison d’être of scholarship is often contested, perhaps especially within the mind and body of the scholar him or herself—it was, upon reflection, inspired by the constant, elusive, and very personal conundrum of embodiment, by a sense of the irreducible strangeness of life, by the shock of an eternally mutating present and presence when we seek only past and future permanence, which is to say by the trauma and bewilderment of continuity when we seek resolution and termination. This was aided by a vision of the simultaneity of multiple selves clamoring for dominance, propriety, order, and voice as they succumb to the inexorable force of entropy, by dreams pushed aside incomplete and irretrievable by the disappointment of awakening, and by awakening to (and within) the disappointedness of dream. In short, the process of creating this book has been a long and complicated exorcism.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Among the prominent images in the Upaniṣads is that of the body as a locus for external forces. Although the early Upaniṣads are best known for their discussions of interior topography, they also display a sure knowledge of and deep concern for the physical body. Their knowledge of organs and other aspects of human physiology is derived largely from the antecedent Brāhmaṇa literature, in most cases indicating that this knowledge served purposes other than health. Principally, the purpose was to describe animals fit for sacrifice. This vision is modified in the Yoga, Śaiva, and other, later subgenres of Upaniṣads, when interest in the vedic sacrifices had begun to wane, to one in which the body is seen to encase nāḍīs (channels that circulate within the body) and cakras (subtle energy centers that are lined up vertically from the perineum to the crown of the head). Thus, the tantric vision of the body led to modifications in the Upaniṣadic view (e.g., Dhyānabindu Upaniṣad 50–72, Yogacūḍāmaṇi Upaniṣad).3 Increasingly, through various practices of yoga (āsana and prāṇāyāma), the body was viewed as transmutable. Although this is most evident in the later Upaniṣads, the early ones foreshadow them in this regard. In the waking state, the “self” (ātman) is said to abide in the heart, but in deep sleep and dream it wanders in the nāḍīs (BĀU 2.1.17). Sometimes it exits the body entirely, leaving the prāṇas in charge. At death, according to the later Upaniṣads, it leaves the body via the suṣumnā nāḍī (central upwardly flowing channel) (Yogaśikha Upaniṣad 6.5, etc.). The chief function of the body, then, is to house the life force (jīva) and, according to some Upaniṣads, the ātman. Brahmā, the Taittirīya (2.1.1) and Muṇḍaka (3.1.7) Upaniṣads state, dwells in the guhā, the space in the heart. Similarly, according to the Kaṭha (2.20) and Śvetāśvatara (3.11) Upaniṣads, the deity dwells in the guhā of all creatures. The Muṇḍaka (2.1.8,10) and Svetāsvatara (3.20) add that puruṣa is placed in it, while the Maitrāyaṇi Upaniṣad (26) states that ātman enters into it. The Kaṭha (4.6) says that the firstborn of Brahmā and Āditya enter and abide there, while many later Upaniṣads list a number of possible deities who assume residence in this secret place. The late Subala Upaniṣad (7.8), for example, states that Nārāyaṇa dwells there, while the Kaivalya Upaniṣad (3) states that the mendicant (yati) enters (visānti) what shines in the secret place.4 As explicated in Chapter 5, the Indic body was ripe for possession.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Yogavāsiṣṭha contains a passage (6.1.82) that is as detailed as Hemacandra’s on the process of possessing other bodies. This important ninth-century text in which yoga, Vedānta, and surreal transformation are central recounts stories told to Rāma as a child by Vasiṣṭha, his family’s guru. The passage in question is included in a lengthy tale of King Śikhidhvaja of Mālva and his devoted wife, Cūḍālā, who were supremely pious and dedicated to the pursuit of self-knowledge (ātmajñāna). It was Cūḍālā who attained enlightenment first, described here as expanded consciousness (citpracetanī, 6.1.78.29). Selflessly, she wished the same for her husband. But his patronizing attitude toward her achievements spurred her to seek solitude in the acquisition of siddhis. She transformed herself into a male sage, a more convincing authority figure to her husband, then into an amorous woman, until finally she reverted to herself. This series of transformations leads the narrator, Vasiṣṭha, into a lengthy digression on the nature of prāṇa (vital air) and the manipulation of kuṇḍalinī, the serpentine energy in the spine that, when controlled, leads to ecstatic experience and enlightenment. In the course of this discussion, Vasiṣṭha eventually turned to the means by which yogins were able to make their bodies either tiny, the size of atoms (aṇutām), or extremely large (sthūlatām, 6.1.82.1).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Possession, especially of the dead, was a particularly lively motif in Sanskrit and other Indic fiction. This was discussed at length by Maurice Bloomfield, who noted in 1917 that possessing another’s body “is an art destined to make a brilliant career in fiction.”5 Bloomfield, however, examined possession solely as a literary curiosity, not as a cultural phenomenon. In his study, Bloomfield summarized tales from the MBh, the KSS, including its lengthy cycle called Vetālapañcaviṃśati or the twenty-five tales of King Vikrama and a certain testy vampire (vetāla), and a few Jain texts, including the Pārśvanātha Caritra and Merutuṇga’s Prabandhacintāmaṇi (Wishing Stone of Narratives). His texts adopt familiar themes: a person or semidivine being like a yakṣa enters the body of another for the sake of personal gain, to protect the possessed individual, to learn a secret art, or to revive a deceased loved one. Some of these themes have already been observed in the MBh. The process of taking possession resembles that described in the Yogasūtras (YS) and its allied literature: forced, and usually stealthy, entry. The term attested most frequently is parakāyapraveśa, synonymous with the YS’s para śarīrāveśaḥ, terms consistent with our general observation that externally induced possession is recorded by forms of the verb pra√viś (the YS use of āveśaḥ demonstrates that this is not always the case). Unlike what we find in the hagiographies and yoga texts, rarely in fiction is spiritual or religious benefit suggested as a motive for possession except as it might coincide with personal gain. Instead, what is most prominent are tales in which animals are possessed either out of necessity, as when King Vikrama is exiled into the body of an elephant after his own body has been taken over by a brahman, or to gain access to secrets, as when various individuals enter the bodies of parrots, with their innate ability to mimic human speech.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The verbal root √viś, to enter, occurs 103 times in the Ṛgveda in various forms. Of these, 69 are used with the prefix . It is not necessary to examine each of these occurrences to conclude that in the ṚV forms of āviś are not used in the simple sense of entry, as a person through a door, but in a more abstract sense, beyond the normal physical contexts of entering a separate enclosed or semienclosed space.10 The root ā√viś in its many derivative forms occurs almost entirely in the sense of entities of different densities or substantialities penetrating and pervading one another.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Another remarkable feature of Mahavidya iconography is the prevalence of skulls and chopped-off heads. Kali, Tārā, Chinnamasta, Matarigi, and Bhairavi all wear garlands of skulls or severed heads and are often said to hold a freshly cut head or a skull in their hands. Skulls also adorn Tara&amp;rsquo;s forehead and sometimes Kali&amp;rsquo;s hair. Some texts devoted to worship of the Mahavidyas also prescribe skulls as seats upon which effective *sadhana *may be performed. The *Mantra-mahodadhih *stipulates that the *sadhaka *should bring a human skull to a remote place in the woods, purify it, bury it, and perform worship while seated on that spot.18 The most dramatic example of a chopped-off head in the context of the Mahavidyas, of course, is that of Chinnamasta, who has severed her own head. Although I commented upon the significance of skulls and choppedoff heads in the discussion of Chinnamasta,19 their prevalence among the Mahavidyas generally deserves further comment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Of the two primary divisions of possession, involuntary and voluntary, the former found textual bases principally in the specialized fields of āyurvedic and tantric exorcistic literature.24 However, voluntary possession, particularly that with an oracular component, appears to have been regarded as more suitable material for textuality. Two reasons may be cited for this. First, because it could be practiced, hence prescribed—and, in general, prescription was formalized through literary production. Precedents for the commission of such material to the written word are found in the literature on omens and portents, dating back to the Vedic vidhāna literature,25 scattered passages from the Sanskrit epics, and the landmark works of the astrologer and mathematician Varāhamihira around 550 C.E.26 In addition, possession was experienced as a symptom of tantric initiation, as we have seen, and for this reason it took on greater soteriological, hence literary, urgency.27 Its commission to textuality was part of an ongoing process of domesticating the ever-receding fringe, part of the expansion of Sanskritic culture into new areas of discourse that extended from the periphery to the center. This is likely a case of Sanskritization in which popular practice was brought into the realm of brahmanical orthodoxy, albeit to a place on the fringe of such orthodoxy. Sanskritization in this case might have also mitigated the threat possession presented to more normative brahmanical orthodoxy.28 This threat was of a total and unrecognizable transcendence that undermined orthodox notions of purity and an independent and impermeable ātman or self. Transcendence achieved during a state of full possession, known to many but experienced by relatively few,29 not only eroded confidence in a stable self, which now hosted other voices, but also annihilated the wellformed and complex personality, the carefully, if culturally, crafted person that served as custodian to the self. Thus, possession negated both the metaphysical and social entities, the self and the person.30&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;***The **Goddess **Who **Guides **through **Troubles ***&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In lists of the Mahavidyas, Tara almost always follows Kali. This suggests a certain importance in the group. Indeed, she is more like Kali in appearance than any of the other Mahavidyas. As we shall see below, interpretations of her significance often come close to those of Kali.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Tara occupies a central place in Tibetan Buddhism and to a great extent plays the role of a Tibetan national deity. In her Buddhist context, she is almost always a benevolent, compassionate, gentle, playful young woman who indulges her devotees and never lets them come to harm. In her Hindu context, on the other hand, particularly as one of the Mahavidyas, Tara is almost always fierce, often horrible to behold, and potentially dangerous. Although Tara also has fierce aspects in Buddhism and benign ones in Hinduism, she generally manifests gentle features in the former and fierce ones in the latter. Historically, it is likely that the Hindu Mahavidya Tara developed from the Buddhist bodhisattva Tara and that the Hindu preference was for her fierce manifestations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is difficult to recommend a single definition of possession, or indeed a single word for it, in the Indian context, primarily because this context—even as described in Sanskrit texts—is more accurately a shifting series of contexts that betray a broad life experience. Kathleen Erndl states, “The word possession can … provide only a rough and partial semantic equivalent for what is a fluid, multifaceted set of concepts.”39 The fact that I am able to locate only one attempt to define possession in Sanskrit literature, by the great tenth-century Kashmiri paṇḍita Abhinavagupta (discussed below), and that this definition does not easily suit most of the Sanskritic contexts of possession, demonstrates that possession as apprehended from these literary contexts constitutes a category in need of clarification. Determining the extent to which such a clarification can be expedited by comparison with the interpretations of possession states proffered by ethnographers is a necessary part of this study. This matter is dealt with below, but here I need simply to mention that comparisons with shamanic ecstasy, yogic samādhi, and hypnotic states must be undertaken cautiously. Mircea Eliade, who many years ago proposed these distinctions in his book Yoga: Immortality and Freedom, has not given adequate attention to possession states in spite of contributing the valuable observation that yogins and fakirs may practice the exercises of particular schools of yoga while separately (or even simultaneously, which is to say eclectically) engaging in “ecstatic practice,”40 which has too often been regarded as synonymous with possession.41 So, without overburdening the reader with taxonomies, at least in the beginning, of what has been regarded in India as spirit or deity possession, I shall try to convey what the ancient and classical texts have said about both the process and the accompanying states of deity and spirit possession.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the most prominent varieties of possession in Indian literature is demonic, disease-producing possession. This topic is largely the province of the classical medical tradition (Āyurveda), where it undergoes visible development from the earliest texts of Caraka and Suśruta in the first few centuries C.E. to the later compendia in the early to mid-second millennium. These texts describe exogenous (āgantuka) diseases caused by grahas (graspers), whose numbers grow and assume more specific identities over the centuries. Thus, a bhūtavidyā (science of spirits, or demonology) was developed to make sense of these afflictive conditions. Bhūtavidyā is articulated not only in the medical literature but in the MBh as well, reminding the reader of the MBh’s brandishing of its own grandeur: “With respect to dharma, artha, kāma, and mokṣa, what is found here may be found elsewhere, but what is not here is nowhere at all.”45 Or again: “No story exists on earth that does not reside in this epic [ākhyānam],”46 a claim with far-reaching implications for our present subject and to which we return in Chapter 13. Although I examine notions and categories of demonology in greater detail in Chapter 12, it is necessary to include traces of it here as well, in order to illustrate the range of possession phenomena noted in the MBh.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Mahavidyas are prominent primarily in tantric literature and in a few late *sakta **purdnas *and *upa **purdnas *(minor, later, or subsidiary *purdnas). *The *tantras *contain little narrative material about the Mahavidyas. They are primarily interested in providing the details of how to worship the Mahavidyas and do not dwell on the meaning of their symbolism or stories that feature them. A typical tantric treatment of a Mahavidya includes, first, her mantra, which is believed to represent her essence; a devotee seeking the goddess&amp;rsquo;s blessing or power must repeat it continually. Next, the goddess&amp;rsquo;s *dhydna *(meditation) mantra describes her physical appearance in some detail; again, the devotee is to fill his or her mind with this description of the goddess while ritually approaching her. The text also gives the goddess&amp;rsquo;s *rahasya *(essence or secret), which is usually similar to her *dhydna *mantra. It also lists her *kvaca *(armor), usually in the form of a prayer to protect her devotee on all sides. A *tantra *usually includes the goddess&amp;rsquo;s *name **stotra, *a list of her names or epithets. Sometimes it describes her yantra (a schematic drawing generally composed of circles, triangles, and stylized lotuses), along with directions for constructing and meditating upon it. In addition to this, the text sometimes gives directions for routine *piijd *(worship), in which various items are offered to the goddess.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the most striking models of possession and exorcism, in which bhūt-prets play a significant role, occurs in the environs of the Bālājī temple in Mehndipur, Rajasthan, as well as at several other spirit healing centers in India.14 Most of the clients at Bālājī are Hindu, from Hindi-speaking areas of India.15 Yet in a slight acknowledgment to the once-dominant Indo-Islamic culture, the clinical model is replete with Urdu terms. These terms are drawn from the British colonial legal system, which adopted the Persian-Urdu language of the Islamic legal system of the Mughals. This is described in the work of Antti Pakaslahti and Graham Dwyer,16 but a summary is apposite here. The possession/exorcism rituals at Bālājī are not standardized; instead, they bear the distinct imprimatur of different healers and exorcists, almost all of whom work outside the main temple.17 Nevertheless, all the healers situate their exorcisms (bhūt-pret utarṇā)18 in an adālat or Islamic court, drawing their inspiration from the concept utilized at the main temple. This, it is important to note, is not an actual court; rather, it is an envisioned court and background metaphor, employed for instituting their processes of possession, exorcism, and healing.19 The primary deity, Hanumān as Bālājī, is the supreme magistrate. He is assisted by two subordinates, Bhairavjī (the local manifestation of the protector divinity Bhairava) and Pretrāj (King of the Spirits of the Dead), who are Bālājī’s messengers (dūt)—as Hanumān is Rāma’s messenger (dūta). Before visiting the office—usually a small shrine room—of one of the many clinicians in the town, Bālājī is first petitioned (darkhvāst) at the main temple. Whether pilgrim or afflicted petitioner, Bālājī is proffered sweets (laddū), parts of which are offered into a sacred fire (havan) in his name, while the remainder is returned to the client as prosād. After this offering, a larger petition (arzi) of sweets is served to Bhairavjī and Pretrāj in side annexes of the temple, where their shrines are located. Through their consumption of the prasād, the power of the deities is said to be infused into the clients. One or two days later, trance commences, usually during scheduled offerings (ārati) or devotional singing (kīrtan), which may occur in either the main temple or the “office” of the exorcist. This kīrtan (at least at the locale in Bālājī that I observed) consists of deafeningly amplified recordings of devotional singing to the melodies of Hindi film songs.20 This engages the largely Hindu audience21 of spirit afflicted (bhūt-pret kī bīmārī) individuals and their families, who chant along with the music, “Jai Mā, Jai Mā” and so on, and clap rhythmically—some of the standard accoutrements of shamanic “trance” music. The music that most often sends afflicted members of the audience (or concerned relatives) into trance, at least in the adālat that I witnessed, is instrumental “snake-charmer” music from a Hindi film of the late 1980s, Naagin, which, appropriately, inspires some of the possessed to writhe like serpents.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Vallabhācārya mentions āveśa in several brief works. His Nirodhalakṣaṇa,9 a text of twenty verses describing the symptoms (lakṣaṇa) of the highest devotional state (nirodha), contains the following verses: “Indeed, for the benefit of those whose senses have become defiled as a result of immersion in the world [saṃsārāveśa], [I declare that as a general principle] one should connect all the [sense] objects with Kṛṣṇa, the underlying omnipotent Lord. Worldly pain or separation cannot exist for those whose minds are always immersed in [āviṣṭa] the attributes of the destroyer of the demon Mura [viz. Kṛṣṇa]. Their joy is similar to that of Hari.”10 Similarly, in his own commentary, Prakasa, on the Śāstrārtha section (verse 53cd) of his Tattvārthadīpanibandha (Essay Illuminating the Nature of Truth), Vallabhācārya states that, for one in a state of divine possession (bhagavadavese), the Lord’s own attributes, such as pervasiveness, enter that person, even if the individual soul (jīva) is not itself all-pervasive.11 In the third verse of the Pañcapadyāni, a short text enumerating qualities of those who are best suited to listen profitably to the BhP, Vallabhācārya says: “Those who know, without doubt, Kṛṣṇa as He really is, believing with all the faculties of their heart, are restless either because of possession [āveśa] by the Lord or because of entering into the highest state of bhakti [nirodha], not otherwise.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In Bengali, √bharā (to fill) is attested in the sense of possession, in addition to its expected etymological usage.49 The nominal form bhar means “weight,” hence the two meanings conflate: being filled with or bearing the weight of a spirit or deity. The extended sense of possession as intense emotional engagement is also found in Bengali: for example, karuṇā-bharala (filled with [i.e., immersed in] compassion).50&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Deborah Bhattacharyya, based in Bengal, examines possession and other behavior that “specifically refers to the collapse of the boundaries between the inside and outside of the individual”51 and are treatable through folk psychiatry. She describes three paradigms of “madness” (pāgalāmi): (1) bhūt bharā (ghost possession); (2) tuk or tuktāka (black magic or sorcery); and (3) māthār golmāl (malfunctioning of the head). The most common terms she found for possession are, in addition to bhūt bharā, bhūte pāoẏā (the getting or receiving of a ghost) and the Sanskritism apadṛṣṭi (inauspicious glance, evil eye),52 which compares to the attested Sanskrit term dṛṣṭipātam.53 Although the term apadṛṣṭi is found in Bengali literature (for example, by Tagore),54 I am unable to find it used with this particular meaning in any Sanskrit text. More common in spoken Bengali for “evil eye” is bad naẓar, borrowed from Urdu.55 I suspect that apadṛṣṭi and other Sanskrit words used more frequently in modern Indo-Aryan than in Sanskrit, such as ārūḍha for possession in Sri Lanka (but unlike āveśa, which is used commonly in both Sanskrit and modern vernacular languages), are the products of local traditions of applied Sanskrit that grew up alongside the literature but are not fully reflected within it; in other words, they were clever attempts to Sanskritize the vernaculars.56 While it is reasonable that ārūḍha should denote spirit or deity possession, it is not so reasonable in the case of apadṛṣṭi. Indeed, Bhattacharyya was surprised to find it used in this sense. Before she heard it used unmistakably in this sense, she writes, “I thought that māthāra golamāḷa was a general term for madness and apadṛṣṭi one of several causal agents of madness.”57&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Michel Foucault noted that the body is the primary site of ritualization, where “the most minute and local social practices are linked up with the large-scale organization of power.”30 This is perhaps nowhere truer than in a ritual system in which the body is regarded as a receptive replicator of the cosmos. This is the case in much of Indian ritual, in which the macrocosm is classically held to naturalize, animate, and regulate, through ritual performance, the microcosmic power structures that engender and are defined by local social arrangements and practices. Such ritual is characterized by a close relationship, more precisely, a seamless flow, of body and cosmos. A well-developed strategy for burnishing this relationship is ritual divinization of the body.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We now turn to the Himalayan and eastern rite of svasthāvesa, not losing sight of our objective of comparing it to the manuscript material from China of the same period and southern India of later epochs. Although the relevant Tantras are themselves undated, Sanderson suggests that one of the earliest, the Nisvāsaguhya, could be a product of the sixth century, though it can be dated with certainty only to a single ninth-century Nepalese manuscript. Thus, Sanderson states that, though the Nisvāsaguhya “seems to be one of the very earliest Tantras of the Siddhānta,” it is nevertheless representative of “a tradition for which we have epigraphical evidence from the sixth century onwards.”59 Sanderson’s remaining texts, which describe svasthāvesa in greater complexity and variation, were composed at various times up to the twelfth century. The epigraphical evidence to which Sanderson refers is important because it helps establish a general dateline for the diffusion of svasthāvesa to China. This evidence exposes a Śaiva tradition from Central and South India that appears to have entered Kashmir only in the first few decades of the eighth century with the ascendancy of Lalitāditya, the wealthiest and most successful of Kashmir’s imperial monarchs. It is worth noting that Lalitāditya and his successors patronized both brahmanical sects and Buddhism, establishing a climate conducive for intellectual exchange. Given the strong tantric presence in Kashmir at that time, this active exchange of ideas quickly engendered a common tantric foundation for Hindu and Buddhist sects.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If my selection of material appears planned but extravagant, the reason is that the planning came to life as a learning process, like perfecting a rāga: I found a few unique scales and constantly improvised on them. Thus, the extravagance could never be exhaustive. The material turned out to be much more extensive than I initially expected. In many key places, in dealing with the Mahābhārata, Tantra, and bhakti texts, for example, I was forced to be illustrative and selective. As a friend, a veteran of many books, told me (paraphrasing W. H. Auden, as I recall) when I was about three-quarters done, this is the kind of book that cannot be completed but, instead, should be abandoned.+++(4)+++ The lesson for me was that both data and knowledge can be infinite, especially as they are swept up in an ever-expanding vision with ever-increasing dimensions and vocalities. The evidence of the multidimensionality and multivocality of possession that I have brought to bear on the topic is more than I had ever hoped to find or thought was even possible. Many readers will still say that I left out this or that, especially from ethnographies or modern autobiographies, or could have interpreted something differently, that I should have attended more to feminist perspectives or psychoanalytic theory. I must also mention that our knowledge of Tantra from the mid-first millennium through the first few centuries of the second millennium C.E. is rapidly expanding, in great measure because of the efforts of Alexis Sanderson and his students at Oxford University. Doubtless, there will soon be much more to say about possession in tantric literature that will add considerably to what I have written in Chapter 10, and may force new paradigms on the notion of possession itself as it was configured historically in India. Nevertheless, for me, this exercise—whatever I have adduced on the topic—has turned religion, particularly as observed in South Asia, on its head, as the material ultimately argues against much of what is stated in standard textbooks. If even a tiny amount of that is transmitted to the reader, this project will have been worth the effort.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In striking contrast to the MBh, the Rāmāyaṇa does not comprehend or explicate a diversity of possession states. In the Rāmāyaṇa possession is employed entirely as a descriptor, sometimes as a metaphor of emotional engagement, not as an indicator of hostile or friendly takeover of a body by a spirit, deity, or yogin. This reflects the divergent nature of the two epics. The MBh is defined by its ambiguities of character and plot, of good and evil, and of dharma. It pits brother against brother, shaking the very foundations of culture, expectation, and familiarity. The Rāmāyaṇa, as many have noted before me, is the opposite of this; it is a story of brothers coming together, of clear resolution of evil.54 The good characters are always good, always the exemplars, while the bad are nearly always unambiguously bad. An unswerving honesty and straightforward moral nobility were inscribed into this epic, and these along with the story itself have never lost their appeal in India. Nevertheless, the later Sanskrit and regional language renditions and adaptations amplified and caricatured this morality, draining it of its heady immediacy, and stripped away much of the complexity of Vālmīki’s characters. This, however, only continued what Vālmīki began, as even in his great epic moral dilemmas were nipped in the bud. As for the characters, with the exception of a few unexpectedly friendly demons,55 the most complex characters, Sītā and Hanumān, extraordinary in the Sanskrit epic, were idealized and caricatured in the later versions.56&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Until the 1970s it was acceptable literary practice to employ terms such as “person,” “self,” and “experience” unquestioningly in academic discourse. Since then, however, these and other related terms have come under close critical scrutiny. The word “consciousness,” for example, is used in contemporary Anglophone culture in ways never imagined, for instance, in classical India; indeed, I have identified more than thirty different words and terms in one Sanskrit text alone, the Bhāgavata Purāṇa, that have been variously translated with this juggernaut significator of contemporary culture.45 These words and terms have distinct meanings with distinct, if partially overlapping, semantic fields. This confers specificity to each word and term that is not conveyed through the blanket translation “consciousness.” Thus, because of the abuse, confusion, and ambiguity of this word revealed in contemporary discursive practice, I have avoided it whenever possible.46 This is not always practical, however, because possession inevitably touches on issues raised by the concept of consciousness as variously formulated.47&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Taking rhetorical leads from the epics, many of the Purāṇas frame possession in the same way; indeed, possession in the same key appears in the Purāṇas with remarkable regularity. It is no exaggeration to say that the Mahābhārata is the most influential text in Indian history, and the tone and timbre of possession, in both its positive and negative manifestations, is established in the Sanskrit epics.+++(4)+++ Because of certain important conceptual links between the epics and the Purāṇas, specifically the way devotion frames possession, it is essential to have a brief look at possession in the Purāṇas as well.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is important now to return to the story of Śaṇkara and the deceased king. This is told in varying degrees of detail in the hagiographies of Śaṇkara life. Two may be cited here: the Śaṇkaradigvijaya (ŚDV) of Mādhava-Vidyāraṇya and the Śrīśaṅkaravijaya (ŚV) of Anantānandagiri.19 The former is much more expansive on the events of his personal life, which is densely imbued with the miraculous, while the latter is both more concise and diffuse, focusing more closely on Śaṇkara’s travels and debates. Both recount the tale of the great ācārya’s possession, which has become a standard narrative item in vedāntic circles. Both of these hagiographies were written several centuries after Śaṇkara’s life, which was probably in the early decades of the eighth century.20 Both abound with dialogue and brief frame stories and are often punctuated by commentary and analysis. From both accounts, it appears that Śaṇkara was in constant motion, traveling from place to place to debate—and defeat—exponents of countless other viewpoints (mata, darśana), from Buddhists to Jainas to Hindu sectarian leaders whose movements centered on the worship of particular deities, including Gaṇapati, Indra, and Yama, as well as exponents of astrology and worshippers of bhūtas, vetālas, and semidivine beings. Śaṇkara’s rebuttal to these teachers was usually a variation on the same theme: Their systems were invalid because they were not based on the authority of the Vedas. One of these systems was kāmaśāstra,21 systematic knowledge of human sexuality.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Mahavidya iconography, mythology, worship, and ritual are dominated by implicit and explicit sexual symbolism. Sexual intercourse is explicitly portrayed in the *dhydna *mantras and portraits of Kali, Chinnamasta, and Tara,24 and most of the individual Mahavidyas are described as sexually attractive and powerful. The mythology concerning the origin of certain individual Mahavidya goddesses (for example, Chinnamasta and Matarigi) stresses sexual tension. The yantras that represent the Mahavidyas contain implicitly sexual symbols, and the central metaphor of awakening *kundalini **sakti *may be interpreted as the arousal of sexual energy. It is also the case that most of the Mahavidyas may be worshiped through the *panca **tattva *ritual, in which sexual intercourse is the culminating act. The centrality of sexual imagery in Mahavidya worship and iconography deserves further comment and analysis at this point. Sexual imagery in Mahavidya materials must be related to the tantric philosophy and ritual that are its primary religious context. This imagery can be understood on several different, but related, levels. On the most abstract level, sexual imagery reflects the tantric vision of reality as the dynamic interaction and tension between the two great principles, Siva and Satki. As the basic underlying principles of reality, the basic components of the essential texture of the cosmos, Siva and Sakti obviously may be understood in a wide variety of ways. Several sophisticated philosophical systems have been constructed on the meaning and interpretation of these two principles, Kashmir Saivism perhaps being the most impressive. Siva and Sakti are present in the mutual attraction and complementarity of the sexes. At the level of human existence and human relationships, they are inherent and embodied in individual males and females. In the context of Tantra, sexual attraction, sexual behavior, and sexual intercourse suggest the underlying texture of reality, which is the manifestation of the dynamic, energetic, creative, and harmonious interaction of Siva and Sakti.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sāyaṇa understands the last quarter-verse of ṚV 10.136.2 differently, avoiding any suggestion of possession. He says: “[the munis] entered the deity’s own physical form” (devatāsvarūpaṃ prāviśan). This is slightly ambiguous, but he probably means here that the munis assumed or constructed a form of the deity rather than merged with a pre-existing divine body.47 The former is more likely because Sāyaṇa consistently avoids speaking of possession, while he readily acknowledges shape-shifting—which is in any case much in evidence in the vedic and post-vedic literature. This example demonstrates that shape-shifting was proximate to possession and perhaps indistinguishable from it in certain contexts, especially in the early history of Sanskrit literature when the vocabulary for the two was not fully differentiated. Although it is unwise to get too far ahead of ourselves, it may be useful to note here an example of this lexical differentiation. The much later Jain Pārśvanātha Caritra distinguishes between shape-shifting (rūpāntarakṛti) and entering another’s body (parakāyapraveśa).48 Another reason for arguing in favor of possession rather than shape-shifting in the case of the muni is that he is, unmistakably, an ascetic, and merging with or becoming possessed by a deity was more likely for such a figure than was shape-shifting, which signifies greater stakes in worldly pursuits than those that the muni appears to have.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The material on āveśa in the Gauḍīya (Bengali) tradition of Kṛṣṇa bhakti is equally rich and is consistent with these findings. I shall briefly examine a few passages from the works of Jīva and Rūpa Gosvāmī, the two greatest disciples and successors of Śrī Caitanya (1486–1533). One of the important and unique uses of āveśa in this tradition, explicated by Rūpa, occurs in the term āveśāvatāra. Avatāras may be either full or partial “descents” or appearances of the Lord in the world, manifested for the purpose of performing a specific action or series of actions. Rūpa’s Saṃkṣepa-Bhāgavatāmṛta (Concise Nectar of the Bhāgavata Purāṇa) catalogues various types of avatāras. Āveśāvatāras are, in the words of S. K. De, “not real Avatāras but Avatāras by analogy; because here the Lord enters into particular Jīvas and thus exalts them into Avatāras.”22 These avatāras share the essence of the Supreme Lord (svarūparūpa), but possess only a fraction of his power (śakti). Jīva Gosvāmī, one generation after Rūpa, refines Rūpa’s views in his Śrīkṛṣṇasandarbha. According to Jīva, various sages are “in possession” (āvesa) of different aspects of the Lord’s power: his jñānaśakti or power of knowledge, his bhaktiśakti or power of devotion, and his kriyāśakti or power of action. Occasionally, adds Jīva, a special devotee is possessed wholly by the Lord (svayamāvesa).23&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I cannot disagree with Gombrich’s statement that “brahmanism inculcates control,” but I believe that such a notion must be nuanced based on the foregoing discussions. We have established that possession is a liminal state of mind,35 with mundane concerns and discourse reconfigured though not ignored. We have also seen that “positive” possession almost always emerges from ritual. Such ritual works in one of two basic ways. The first, brahmanical, inculcates a controlled state of possession through the observance of complicated and precise processes. The second, typically non-brahmanical in the sense of non-Sanskritic (this was never a disincentive to brahman participation),36 encourages possession by inculcating strategies for release rather than control. The former amounts to a guided gradual transformation through metamorphosis, while the latter amounts to a guided sudden release. In both cases we are speaking of ritual that depicts the tension between freedom and discipline. Although the gradualists are beset with a greater number of formal rules, in both cases style and structure are important, conferring a sense of rigorousness that is essential for materialization of the process.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Possession in the āyurvedic texts has been addressed before, notably by Mitchell Weiss,36 who analyzes Indian categories of unmāda and exogenous disease-causing spirits with reference to Freudian and other psychoanalytic categories.37 In addition, Jan Meulenbeld has succinctly described views and categories of bhūtavidyā set forth in different āyurvedic texts. These textual differences have been considerable and should be kept in mind in the ensuing discussions. Among the areas of disagreement were the nature of bhūtas, their ontological reality, their number and identity, their cultural origins, and what constitutes the discipline of bhūtavidyā, including knowing not just the names and descriptions of bhūtas but the diagnostics, pharmacology, and ritual treatment for possession by bhūtas.38&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Because possession is deeply embedded in the complexities of local culture and ritual, it is important to exercise caution in formulating general theories about it.23 Although it is not my intention to present a general theory, it is nevertheless necessary to present different viewpoints regarding possession, particularly because most available theories have been applied to possession in India. To begin, the interpretation of possession as the work of demonic, ungodly beings is characteristically the property of certain Western Christian, usually Protestant, denominations, though, as shown below, South Asians themselves often enough accuse tantrikas in the temporary employ of local enemies of setting malevolent spirits on family members afflicted with mental illness. Commenting on studies of possession, though not singling out Christian perspectives, Nicholas Dirks comments: “Most of the literature on possession deals with the nasty kind, when it is the devil rather than the lord who has taken up residence within our mortal coil.”24 This may be stretching it a bit, especially given the explosion of possession studies among anthropologists since the 1960s. But it does constitute a well-represented viewpoint commonly invoked until the mid-twentieth century, one that has not been completely abandoned. It is more accurate to agree with Isabelle Nabokov, who observes that despite Christian missionary accounts of possession as “replete with prejudicial interpretations and factual errors, they still disclose a vibrant, well-established tradition of boundary transgressions between this world and the hereafter.”25&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Both literary and iconographic materials give the general impression that the ten Mahavidyas are different forms of an overarching, transcendent female reality, who is usually referred to simply as the Mahadevi (great goddess). An underlying assumption of many *sakta *texts is that the highest reality is the Great Goddess, and this infinitely great being manifests herself in a wide variety of forms. Indeed, this is perhaps the central feature of Hindu *sdkta *theology in those texts.16 Many myths in *sakta *literature describe a goddess, or the goddess, as producing other goddesses from her own body. In such cases she often announces that she assumes different forms at different times to maintain cosmic stability,17 to bless a particular devotee, or out of a sense of sport or playfulness. The theological idea is that ultimate reality, which is female in essence and form, displays herself in a great variety of ways for different purposes. Some texts even say that wherever a female being exists, there the goddess reveals herself, being present in every female form.18 This theme is strong and obvious in the case of the Mahavidyas. Their presence in *devi *temples seems to state: &amp;ldquo;The goddess enshrined in this place assumes many forms.&amp;rdquo; The Mahavidyas are the concrete expression of the idea of &amp;ldquo;many forms.&amp;rdquo; In the case of goddesses who are identified with a particular place, and who are not well known outside their local areas, association with the Mahavidyas lends them a cosmic, universal, transcendent dimension. The presence of the Mahavidyas in a goddess temple identifies a local or regional goddess with an all-India mythology or symbolic structure, lending her a certain prestige.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The obvious place to begin is the Vetālapañcaviṃśati, probably the best-known example of possession in Hindu fiction (I exclude the MBh from this category). I can hardly do better than to quote Asko Parpola’s lengthy summary of the frame story of this cycle:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The hero is a brave king called Vikramāditya, the “sun of valour,” or (in Somadeva’s version) Trivikramasena. A mendicant (bhikṣu, śramaṇa) called Kṣāntiśīla donates a fruit every day to the king, who without further ado gives them to his treasurer. Ten years pass until accidentally it is found out that each fruit contains a precious jewel. The king asks the mendicant why he is giving these presents, and the mendicant replies that he needs the help of a hero in a magic ritual. The king immediately promises his help, and the mendicant asks him to come to a big cemetery (smasāna) on the fourteenth night of the dark half of the month. The mendicant would be waiting there beneath a banyan tree (vaṭa).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

She is also sometimes said to be, along with Kali and Tārā, an *adi *(primordial) Mahavidya, which suggests that she occupies a high place in the group, that she, like them, represents a complete vision of reality.1 According to other sources, she represents the penultimate vision of enlightened consciousness, a stage of consciousness suffused with *sattvic *qualities but lacking the completeness of fully enlightened consciousness, represented by Kali, which is beyond all quality and form, *nirguna.1 *&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In view of these accounts of possession in the performances of the Kṛṣṇa and Rām līlās, can we ask whether the equivalent of “dramatic possession” is found in Sanskrit theater? The answer appears to be a qualified “yes.” We should be careful, however, not to confuse possession with other altered states. For example, in Kalidasa’s rendition of the tale of Purūravas and Urvaśī, Purūravas wanders about in a state of madness born of extreme longing for his beloved Urvaśī, who had disappeared in a sage’s garden (Vikramorvaśīya, Act 4). Although one can say that Purūravas is possessed with longing for Urvaśī and that he exhibits many of the same mental and physical symptoms of spirit or deity possession, he cannot be possessed in the sense being addressed here. Kālidāsa likely would have called it āvesa, praveśa, and so forth had he intended it in the primary meanings discussed here. Nevertheless, the proximity of Purūravas’s experience demonstrates that it is probably unwise to label an experience “possession” unless the sources provide direct support. Sanskrit texts tend to be precise to a fault, even if interpretation is occasionally warranted. In spite of frequent self-censorship of possession and emotion in general, especially in the colonial period, as discussed earlier, most Sanskrit authors, especially dramatists, poets, and redactors of religious and secular tales, had the means to point the reader in that direction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;***She **Whose **Body **Is **the **World ***&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Her complexion is vermillion in color. She has three eyes and wears a crown resplendent with jewels. She has the disk of the moon on her brow and has a smiling face. Her breasts are high and firm. In her two hands she holds a red lotus and a bowl filled with jewels. She is very peaceful and amiable. Her right foot rests on a jeweled jar. In this way one should meditate upon the supreme mother goddess.1&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Among the most visible manifestations of early Indian thought are Vedānta, classical Yoga, Buddhism, and Jainism, all of which are nuanced reactions to the perceived excesses of vedic ritualism. Chapter 7 discusses possession in these important branches of knowledge. Although possession is not a primary concern of the literature of these schools, which, on the whole, avoids discussion of personal experience except in the vaguest, most normative, and most fragmentary ways, it is nevertheless mentioned and occasionally discussed at some length in their foundational philosophical texts.+++(4)+++&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Possession is, first and foremost, a quality of embodiment. It may be a uniquely configured embodiment or, under certain conditions, a viewpoint on embodiment. Embodiment is characterized in the Upaniṣads as primordial, archetypal: It happened in the beginning. In that beginning, bráhman, the eternal, absolute, unlimited power, was anthropomorphized, even humanized, by manifesting recognizable qualities such as desire and fear, as púruṣa, the first and supreme person. This neuter bráhman, with or without its masculine cloak as púruṣa, desired multiplicity, thus entered, embodied, and animated an equally primordial, if initially inert, materiality. The bráhman then divided its newly adopted body into male and female, then into all different types of sexually differentiated beings. This primordial embodiment and subsequent mixing and recombinant identities is at the basis of the Indian notions of multiple and polyvalent selves. This is a self that cannot be expressed except through its multiformity—and which is therefore not reducible except by recapturing its archetypal nature through philosophical understanding or spiritual exercise. Embodiment or animation, however, in its multiform complexity, is irreducible in and to its essences without a termination in the form of death, which returns the materiality of an embodied individual to its primordial quiescence and latency. Archetypal embodiment, then, is also archetypal possession, serving as a model for the flow and exchange of substances, substance codes, and essences, which affect other psychophysical organisms for the duration of their shared locus. However, even on the eventual (and inevitable) separation of substances, this flow and exchange to a great extent produces the unique identity of every embodied individual.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have come across five versions of the origin of the Mahavidyas as a group. In one of these versions, the Mahavidyas are different forms of the goddess Sati; in a second version they are forms of the goddess Parvati; in a third they arise from the goddess Kali, herself one of the Mahavidyas; in a fourth they are forms of the goddess Durga; and in a fifth they are said to arise from the goddess Sataksi, who is also identified with Sakambhari and Durga.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In Marathi āveś carries the same semantic range as it does in Hindi. J. T. Molesworth notes many compounds borrowed from or modeled on Sanskrit, probably limited to Marathi literature (they are less likely in speech, even among upper castes): kāmāveś (absorption or immersion in love), krodhāveś (anger), lobhāveś (greed), śauryāveś (heroism), piśācāveś (evil or evil spirits), harṣāveś (laughter), śokāveś (grief), īrṣyāveś (envy), kṛpāveś (a state of grace), and mohāveś (delusion).63 Unfortunately, Molesworth does not provide sources, but these appear to have been drawn from (highly Sanskritized) translations or perhaps from independent texts in Marathi on poetic theory.64 These terms bespeak the increasing use of āveś with words for emotions and states of mind that are attested by the end of the first millennium C.E. in Sanskrit as well as in Mahārāṣṭrī Prakrit. Rājaśekhara, writing in the Western Deccan around 900 C.E., has the following line in his ornate Prakrit drama Karpūramañjarī: tā vasantavaṇṇaṇeṇa siḍhilaāmi se taggadam āvesam (“Well, I must sing the praises of spring-time to him and so slacken his passion [āvesam] for her”).65&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Hiltebeitel (2001:18ff.) argues for a much more consolidated dating, with the entire composition between 150 B.C.E. and the beginning of the Common Era. See Fitzgerald’s critique of this (2003).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It will not be possible here to deal with cases not involved directly with possession, no matter how fascinating, such as the case of the mixed-gender identity of Sikhandin, in the Vanaparvan.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cf. Olivelle 1998:375; Roebuck 2000:312.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The literature on regional MBhs and Rāms attests to this; cf. Raghavan 1980, Richman 1991.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cf. Amaruśataka: premāveśita (37), premāveśa (43), also Kādambarī 357:3; see Daśakumāracarita for madanāveśa (48:7), also Kādambarī 271.4, 280.7; in addition, KSS shows smarāveśavivaśa (37.205), ārūḍhasmarāveśa (65.230), smarāviṣṭa (81.55), and smarajvarāveśavivaśa (119.156). Interestingly, the only occurrence in the Kāmasūtra is for anger: iti krodhād ivāviṣṭã kalahāṃ prayojayet (2.5.38c).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Saundarānanda 14.31: nidrām nāveṣṭum arhasi.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Hará 1979a renders this “sleeplessness.”&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Lajjāsamāviṣṭa in Harivaṃśa (Citraśālā Press) 3.115.39.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;For most of these words Hara supplies multiple references, though here one suffices. All references are from the MBA unless otherwise stated: adharma (12.251.17), ahaṃkāra (13.102.10), alakṣmī (3.33.39), anartha (12.171.23), asukha (11.25.11), asura (3.240.11), avamāna (3.246.20), avṛṣṭi/ativṛṣṭi (12.91.35, ārti (6.15.4), bhaga (3.163.35), bhī (3.168.16), cintā (Harivaṃśa 109.23), darpa (1.189.17), dānava (3.240.13), duḥkha (4.18.8), durbhikṣa (12.68.29), dainya (12.149.105), ghṛnā (3.36.18), harṣa (3.162.10), hrī (9.62.54), jvara (12.27.12), kali (3.56.3), kaśmala (7.144.7), kāma (1.204.15), kautūhula (3.20.75), kopa (3.11.30), krodha (12.249.5), kṛpā (5.180.36), kṣudh (14.57.19), lobha (12.170.14), mada (16.4.31), manmatha (Rām 4.65.15), manyu (1.204.17), māna (12.253.38), mātsarya (12.12.29), moha (7.31.32), mṛtyu (12.149.41), nidrā (Rām 4.26.7), pāpman (12.17.2), pauruṣa (9.10.24), pipāsā (13.70.6), prajagara (7.56.7), rajas (12.329.29.2), rāga (14.42.51), rākṣasa (3.240.33), roṣa (3.21.18), ruṣ(ā) (9.25.25), sambhrama (1.73.25), sattva (6.40.10), śoka (3.2.15), śrama (13.70.6), tamas (4.55.24), tuṣṭi (1.187.5), vepathu (5.85.13), vismaya (3.289.23), viṣṇu (3.195.12, cf. 12.159.130), vyādhi (12.91.34), yakṣa (3.219.51), yakṣman (12.329,46.25). It should be noted that in this survey I am leaving out hundreds of references to pra√viś in its usual sense of “entrance.” On the differences between krodha and manyu, see Hara 2001.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Trans. van Buitenen 1973:426.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;See Smith and Carri 1994.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Shulman 1994:7.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Trans. van Buitenen 1975:359.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Snell 1953:49.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Pesic 2002:11.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ibid.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Shulman 1994:23.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Handelman and Shulman 1997:111.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;13.40.56ab: netrābhyāṃ netrayor asyā raśmīn saṃyojya raśmibhiḥ. This is consistent with the theory of apperception in Nyāya and Vaiśesika that sight is made possible by rays emanating from the eye and traveling to the object, thus grasping it.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;13.40.57: lakṣaṇaṃ lakṣaṇenaiva vadanaṃ vadancna ca | aviceṣṭann atiṣṭhad vai chāyevāntargato muniḥ ||&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;13.40.58d: sā tam abudhyata ||&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;13.41.3cd: niśceṣṭaṃ stabdhanayanaṃ yathālekhyagataṃ tathā ||&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;13.41.14d: vāṇi saṃskārabhūṣitā ||&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;On this story, see Bloomfield 1917:7–8. The dimensions of possession that I am addressing here are at odds with Bloomfield’s more conventional reckoning, that in the MBh “[t]here is but one elaborate instance of the art of pervading another’s body with one’s mind-stuff” (p. 7). See also White 2004 for another evaluation of paraśarīrapraveśa in the MBh. This article came to my attention too late to take full advantage of it.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I agree with Rocher (1986) that assigning exact dates to these Purāṇas is risky.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Liṅga Purāṇa (LiP) 1.24.128, cited by Hara 1979a:272.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;LiP 1.24.130.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;This concept of partial incarnation, aṃśāvatāra, was exploited by Vaiṣṇavas in the early second millennium C.E.; cf. Chapter 9.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;12.59.130ab: tapasā bhagavān viṣṇur āviveśa ca bhūmipān|. Fitzgerald translates: “Through the power of his inner heat, the blessed Viṣṇu entered into the king” (2004:311).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Hara cites a similar verse, supposedly also from the LiP (1.170.25[?], which, however, I am unable to find in the published edition): kūrmarūpam ahaṃ kṛtvā uddhareyaṃ mahīm imām | jalakrīḍānusadṛśaṃ vārāhaṃ rūpam āviśat ||. This describes Viṣṇu’s descent (avatāra) as a tortoise (kūrma) and a boar (varāha) in language typical of the idiom of avatāra in the Purāṇas. The change of voice is somewhat inexplicable; but the latter at least is phrased in terms of Viṣṇu possessing (āviśat) the form of a boar.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;MBh 1.61.66ab; cf. MBh 10.7.64–65 in the discussion below of Aśvatthāman’s possession of Śiva in the Sauptikaparvan.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Shulman 1994:27.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cf. Granoff 1998a:177ff.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Morris 2000:100.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cf. LiP 70.43–8, in which ether and sound penetrate the element of touch, vāyu contains both sound and touch, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Handelman and Shulman 1997:111.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;1.166.27cd: apy enaṃ naramāṃsena bhojayeti punaḥ punaḥ ||&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;My translations are adapted from van Buitenen 1973:333–335.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;This ferocity in which embattled warriors entered states of possession and were said to alter their appearances was not limited to India or the MBh, but may be seen elsewhere in the Indo-European world. See Cahill 1995:82–84, for an account from the twelfth-century Irish prose epic “Tain Bo Cuailnge, the Cattle Raid of Cooley.” This account has a striking resemblance to the MBh (though I am not suggesting any kind of direct influence). The Irish referred to their possession and shape-shifting as “warp-spasm.” Cahill writes: “The Romans, in their first encounters with these exposed, insane warriors, were shocked and frightened. Not only were the men naked, they were howling and, it seemed, possessed by demons, so outrageous were their strength and verve. Urged by the infernal skirl of pipers, they presented to the unaccustomed and throbbing Roman sensorium a multimedia event featuring all the terrors of hell itself” (pp. 82–83). Cahill’s translation of the passage from the “Tain” is well worth consulting.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;MBh 3.240.11-34; trans. van Buitenen 1975:692–693.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cf. the note on this verse in Johnson 1998:105.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;On Aśvatthāman’s experience as epiphany, see Laine 1989:122ff., 149ff.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cf. Johnson 1998:40.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ibid.:xxi; John D. Smith 1980:70.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;dharmc cārthe ca kāme ca mokṣe ca bharatarṣabha | yad ihāsti tad anyatra yan nehāsti na tat kvacit || (1.56.33).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;anāśrityaitad ākhyānaṃ kathā bhuvi na vidyate | (1.2.240ab).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Wujastyk 1998:219ff.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;See MBh 9.44–46 for a vivid and detailed description of Skanda’s spirit warriors.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;See Mann 2003:15–119, which is now the most complete and scholarly account of the birth of Skanda in the MBh; also Mann 2005.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The Śivasahasranāma, in the Anuśāsanaparvan, gives Āveśa as a name of Śiva: āvedanīya āveśaḥ sarvagandhasukhāvahaḥ (MBh 13.17.115ab).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;3.219.24–25; trans. by van Buitenen 1975:658.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;For a more “medically” detailed account, see a section from the Kaśyapasaṃhitā translated by Wujastyk (1998:212–230). Also very important is White 2003:35ff., which locates the balāgrahas of the MBh in the art and culture of the Kuṣāṇas. White provides a number of cognate passages in the Purāṇas and in temple architecture, and in his effort to historicize these “seizers,” provides a number of epidemiological explanations. For example, he interprets Pūtanā, “Stinky,” with the pustulant sores of chicken pox, Śītapūtanā, “Cool Stinky,” as evocative of the later smallpox goddess Śītalā, and Saramā, the mother of dogs in the ṚV, Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa, and elsewhere as carriers of epilepsy, because mad dogs, like epileptics, can foam at the mouth (pp. 51ff). Also relevant are White’s comments on the avian nature of many of these seizers, which he reads semiotically as fearful bearers of contagious diseases and carrion-eaters (pp. 43 [with a figure of a Nepalese bird-headed grāhī of the late fifteenth century], 58).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;See Snellgrove 1987:134 and Staal 1990b:288ff., for a review of different views of the problem.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;See Pollock’s insightful comments on this issue (1993b:282f.), where he describes the “othering” that characterizes the Rāmāyaṇa, quite distinct from the MBh.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;See the discussion by Sutherland and Goldman 1996:65–70. On the rākṣasas of Laṅka, they write, “although theirs is largely a brutalized world given over to the indulgence of the senses, there are numerous indications in the book that the city also possesses a life of art and even of religion” (p. 65). See also Pollock’s discussion (1991:68–84).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;See the excellent discussion on these two by Sutherland and Goldman 1996:39–62.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;This is a theme Pollock develops in 1993b.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ramanujan 1991:44ff.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;1991:199. Lutgendorf notes, however, that “[i]t is clear that most expounders do not enter into a state of actual ‘possession’—indeed, their performances are characterized by a high degree of lucidity and control—yet we must note that the relationship between possession and folk performance is a complex one and even in kathã, … the line demarcating the two is not always clear” (1991:184). This supports Ramanujan’s observations cited above.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I have seen images of Prahlāda, son of the demon king Hiraṇyakaśipu and an ardent devotee of Viṣṇu, placed on a few altars at Bālājī, and I expect that worship of him may be seen elsewhere. But this is on an extremely limited scale compared to worship of Hanumān.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;See Alter 1992:198ff.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cf. Lutgendorf 1997:320.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;For example, “rage possessed Rāvaṇa” (rāvaṇaṃ manyur āviśat, 6.62.33d); “anger could no longer possess him” (krodho nānatram āviŜat, 1.64.3).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;“Hearing of her arrival, who had lived so long in the home of a rākṣasa, Rāghava was overcome [āviśat] with the triad of delight, anger, and pity” (6.102.16).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;“Overwhelmed by brahman killing” (brahmahatyā yadāviśat, 1.23.18).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;“Heartache over the exile of Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa once more swept over [āviveśa] him, the equal of Vāsava, as the demon’s darkness sweeps over the sun” (2.57.2), trans. Pollock 1991:204.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;“But then we began to experience intense sweating, fatigue, and fear. And we were seized by confusion [samāviśata mohaḥ], which soon gave way to a dreadful stupor” (4.60.10), trans. Lefeber 1994:182.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;“Then Rāma’s consternation gave way to a feeling of fear that shot through [āviveśa] him with sharp pangs” (3.42.20, trans. Pollock 1991:176). “Having seen the bodies and all the limbs of Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa in a heap, covered with arrows, fear overwhelmed [āviśat] Sugrīva” (6.36.24). “Seeing Rāma completely enraged, all beings became fearful of a rising tide of dread, and Rāvaṇa was overcome [āviśat] with fear” (6.91.4).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;“Tell me once again, monkey, of the characteristic marks of Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa so that sorrow shall not overwhelm [samāviśet] me” (5.33.3), trans. Goldman and Sutherland 1996:201. “Grief overcame [samāviśat] Sītā, anxious, looking [for Lakṣmaṇa]” (7.47.17d).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;This is exceptional in the Rām, where pra√viś is employed almost entirely to indicate simple entrance; cf. 1.66.3, 1.67.1, 76.7; 2.1.5, 9.3, 62.12, 65.22; 3.1.1, 11.15,16, 52.11; 5.16.9; 6.22.6; 7.51.5, 65.3, 73.2, 93.6,7. In one instance ā√viś indicates uncomplicated entrance: 7.14.21d, toraṇām tat samāviśat, “Rāvaṇa entered the gateway,” parallels pra√viś in the next verse, 7.14.22.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;“The brothers were absorbed [samāviśan] in the precepts of dharma proper to each of them” (7.10.2cd).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;“It had javelins and iron cudgels arrayed in rows” (yathākramāveśitaśaktitomaram, 5.45.5d); trans. Goldman and Goldman 1996:238.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;“When Lakṣmaṇa and Sītā had entered [praviṣṭe] the cave, Rāma said to himself, ‘Good, it is all arranged,’ and then he donned [āviśat] his armor” (3.23.14), trans. Pollock 1991:137.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;“collapsed to the ground” (dharaṇyāṃ samupāviśat, 5.32.11); trans. Goldman and Goldman 1996:198.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;“Then Rama lay down [samāviśad] with Sītā upon the pallet” (2.81.20), trans. Pollock 1991:252. “Nor would sleep come [āviveśa] to him when he had gone to bed at night” (4.26.7).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;“Since I was exhausted, I once more sat on your lap as you sat [āviśam] there” (5.36.20), trans. Goldman and Goldman 1996:217.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;1.70.14: “leaving Kuśadhvaja in my care” (kuśadhvajaṃ samāveśya bhāraṃ mayi); 1.41.3: “turning the kingdom over to Dilīpa” (tasmin rājyaṃ samāveśya dilīpe).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;1.42.19cd: “They became reabsorbed into the ākāśa and were restored to their own realms” (punar ākāsam āviśya syāṃl lokān pratipedire ||); cf. also 3.50.29, 5.1.181, 6.31.62, 40.59, 45.33, 57.45. Not unrelated is 3.50.22: “like a streak of lightning caught [āviśya] within a storm cloud” (trans. Pollock 1991:196). Also: “If you fly about [āviśasi] in the three worlds, taking the form of a quick-witted bird” (6.130.60).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;2.87.17: ctaṃ āviśataḥ śailaṃ; 7.14.3: kailāśaṃ girim āviśat.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;2.38.6: vanaṃ āviíate nūnaṃ sabhāryaḥ sahalakṣmaṇaḥ |&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;MBh 11.19.16, Viviṃśati absorbed (āviśa) in sleep; Rām 3.52.12, occupying (āviśat) the women’s quarters of the palace; Rām 4.19.15, monkeys possessing (āviśya) citadels; Rām 7.58.1, Śatrughna occupying (samāviśet) the arbor (parṇaśālā) at night.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;2.30.10, trans.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Two phenomena that share conceptual territory with āveśa are nyāsa and (prāṇa-) pratiṣṭhā. There is an important distinction between them: The latter two are intentional, textualized, and enjoined bodily constructions, transformations of intellectual and social practices (arguably these are the same thing) into sacred physical terrain. Nyasa (literally “setting upon, placing down, imposition”)38 is a common, and often standard, part of brahmanical worship that finds its greatest advocacy in the Tantras and Purāṇas. As a result, extended instruction of nyāsa may be found in virtually every manual of Hindu daily practice, including those sold outside the gates of Hindu temples everywhere in India.39 Nyasa is employed in obligatory rites (nitya) such as the daily saṃdhyā, the twice-daily rites of the twice-born performed at sunrise and sunset, as well as in the full range of rituals to be performed on special occasions, some calibrated calendrically (naimittika), and others performed to fulfill personal desires (kamya).40 Related to mudras or hand positions of esoteric significance (cf. Tantraraja Tantra 4.44d, which explicitly links a certain mudra with āveśa),41 nyāsa is a practice that combines simple mudras with brief mantras invoking names of deities, divine powers, ṛṣis, Vedic sacrifices, or letters of the alphabet. The intent of nyāsa is to impose or place the power of the mantras, and perforce the deities, and so on, which they inscribe, on or within various body parts, either one’s own or that of an image of a deity. This is effected, according to the widespread theology of nyasa, through a process called bhūtasuddhi, purification of the five fundamental elements (mahabhūtas)—earth, water, fire, mobile air, and all-pervasive space.42 The idea of a conjunction of deity and ritualist is old in India. The Bṛhaddevatā, a text of probably the mid-first millennium C.E. that organized Vedic knowledge according to the deities of the Ṛgveda, states as part of its conclusions that “fully introducing the deity into the mind” (manasi saṃnyasya devatām) while performing a sacrifice is a true signifier of knowledge.43&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have limited the above critique to medical texts because Weiss and Clifford have offered the most important theoretical contributions to the consideration of negative possession in South Asia available to date, and they both do so in the context of classical medical texts. However, bhūtavidyā has a broad panorama in South Asian culture, and much of it lies in areas peripheral to these texts. Therefore, in the interest of providing a more complete portrait of negative possession in South Asia, let us consider a few other demonologies, from both texts and ethnographies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>04 Possession and the Body in the Brahmasūtras</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The final section of Bādarāyaṇa’s Brahmasūtras (BS) discusses the symptoms of enlightenment. One of the final sūtras in this section states that, just as the flame of a lamp “enters” (āveśaḥ) another wick, a liberated being can enter another body (pradīpavad āveśas tathā hi darśayati, BS 4.4.15). It will be of interest to examine the remarks of a few commentators on this sūtra. We first look at what is probably the oldest surviving commentary on the BS, that of Bhāskara, composed in the mid-seventh century, whose sectarian affiliation is unclear from this commentary. This is his sole surviving work. Then we examine the remarks of Śaṇkara, who wrote his advaita commentary about a century later. The next commentary to be briefly examined is that of Nimbārka, whose school is called bhedābheda (nondifference in difference) and whose date is disputed, but may have flourished in South India at about the same time as Śaṇkara.26 Then, we look at the Vaiṣṇava commentary by Rāmānuja, who penned his viśiṣṭādvaita (qualified nondualism) works in the eleventh or twelfth century. This is followed by a brief exploration of the Śaiva commentary by Śrīkaṇṭha of the thirteenth century and the subcommentaries by Appayya Dīkṣita on both Śaṇkara and Śrīkaṇṭha, written in the seventeenth century. Finally, we examine the śuddhādvaita (pure nondualism) commentary by the Vaiṣṇava sectarian founder Vallabhācārya written in the early decades of the sixteenth century. To all of them, the sūtra assumes a background in yoga: āveśa is clearly regarded by both the sūtrakāra and the bhāṣyakāras as a siddhi (perfection) attainable through yogic practice or as a consequence of liberation. Examining this material also sheds light on the relationship between the different sectarian and commentatorial traditions with little studied aspects of their yogic heritage.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As others have noted before me, spirit (or deity) possession must be viewed from within the cultural systems of which it is a part. In such systems, as Loring Danforth points out, “people who are seriously disturbed are generally not able to express or resolve their idiosyncratic problems through the cultural symbols provided by the idiom of spirit possession.” Spirit possession is, therefore, “an adaptive response through which they are able to resolve social and psychological problems in a widely accepted, and sometimes well-respected, cultural idiom.”41 Thus the question of labeling spirit or deity possession a form of deviant behavior or psychologically definable pathology must be answered within the context of the local culture. This is no less true in South Asia than anywhere else. In spite of (or perhaps because of) a suspected (or suspect) normalcy, and because of the extensive time frame of the topic as I approach it here, it is necessary to engage in a fairly thorough review of the psychological and psychoanalytic interpretations of possession as I see them and their relevance to the topic at hand.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In Chapter 2, I inquired as to what extent we can equate possession as discourse with possession as event. My answer(s) to this difficult question should have become clear in the course of this study. Essentially, the wealth of evidence both textual and ethnographic demonstrates that the link between discourse and event is so proximate that it is nearly indistinguishable. The discourse of possession in India is not just verbal or linguistic but performative as well. Possession is not just an inner experience defined by one’s intensity of feeling and focus, dissociative powers, and linguistic and performative capabilities; it is an event that is publicly negotiable and verifiable. Standards and paradigms of possession are available in South Asian public culture, both contemporary and ancient, and may be verified in the ethnographies and classical texts. The issue of discourse is closely tied in with the nature of individuality and the individual in South Asia and whether possession can contribute to a greater understanding or unveiling of that nature. I ask, in effect, whether a partially or fully manifested and attributed deity or spirit, within the locally constructed nexus of discourse and event, destroys the fabric of the individual. I have also wondered, apropos of these questions, whether it is a mistake to assume an autonomous individual in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I should say a few words here about the study of possession. In India and elsewhere, the field has been dominated by compartmentalized ethnographies and, less often, by histories of possession in specific lineages or local cultures. No syncretic history or synoptic account of possession in India has been attempted.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; While my intention here is to locate and capture such a history, I have tried to keep in mind the problems associated with “master narratives” and endeavored to avoid them. Even if I were dedicated to a single theoretical model (and it will soon become obvious that I am not), two things would still parry any attempt to create such a master narrative: the sheer variety of the textual and ethnographic source material, and the delicacy with which the layers of their connections must be handled.+++(4)+++ I have been constantly aware of the pitfalls of both subjectivity and objectification that confront both scholars and participants who think about and live with possession. This inspires in me a certain trepidation, because it sharpens rather than occludes the necessity to define and delimit, to construct and deconstruct, to know when to intervene and when to leave alone, to know how strongly to invoke situated histories, to know when to allow tradition and imagination to merge, and to feel comfortable if all my data and conclusions are not scrubbed clean of contradiction. Nevertheless, I take full responsibility for lapses in clarity, errors in judgment, and oversights in the use of material.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The most extended example of possession as a motif in Sanskrit fiction occurs in the early seventh-century drama Bhagavadajjukāprahasanam (The Farce of the Saint-Courtesan), by the Pallava king Mahendravarman (though it was more likely written by a paṇḍita in his court). One of the peculiarities of Sanskrit drama is that it is composed not just in Sanskrit but in one or more Middle Indic (Prakrit) dialects as well, based on the social ranking of the characters. Because several words in the Prakrit parts of the dialogue do not find Sanskrit phonological counterparts (e.g., āhiṇḍitum [to beg]), it is possible that this drama was originally written in Prakrit, after which a full Sanskrit rendering (chaya) was produced, rather than originally entirely in Sanskrit, after which the appropriate lines of the dialogue were translated into Prakrit. This is important because it may indicate that the flow of influence of the popularly conceived possession was from Prakrit, which is to say the public domain, into Sanskrit. However, this is by no means a final proof; it may simply be that the author worked in this fashion.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I speak of an experience of soma (Chapter 5), a cultural or religious experience, a personal experience, a dissociative experience, and especially an experience of possession, I am employing with apparent ease terminology that hovers on a precipitous edge of ancient and classical Indian discourse maps. No one can doubt that people as well as cultures and civilizations experience in some sense, and that they experience all the time. Several scholars, however, including Wilhelm Halbfass, Wayne Proudfoot, and Robert Sharf, have noted, or even reinforced, certain relatively recent doubts cast on the “notion” of experience, particularly religious experience, positing that its validity can be situated only within highly specified cultural contexts. Halbfass sorts out the concept in Indian thought, particularly in its encounter with Western models of experience,50 while Sharf, following Proudfoot and others, traces the conceptualization of experience to the German philosopher Arthur Schleiermacher in the early nineteenth century and shows that personal religious experience was not an issue of doctrinal concern in the textuality of Asian religions until the early twentieth century.51 Thus, when I speak of experience in the ways mentioned above, am I injecting into the personal and cultural networks of possession in South Asia an epistemology that threatens to bury the subject beneath fragile and dissembling layers of modern discourse? Am I reading possession in South Asia as a servant of the overwrought contemporary, peculiarly Western, discourse of experience? With such dangers in mind, Sharf resolves to employ the term “experience” guardedly.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is striking that imagery of both sex and death should be so central in Mahavidya materials and that both are so often juxtaposed in the characterization of a goddess and in certain rituals of worship. Kali, Tārā, and Chinnamasta, in particular, often combine both types of imagery in their icons. In an eighteenth-century Kangra painting, Tārā stands on Kama and Rati, who are copulating on a cremation fire.31 Kali is sometimes shown copulating with Siva in a cremation ground,32 and Chinnamasta decapitates herself while standing or sitting on Rati, who is having sexual intercourse with Kama. It is not unusual for the copulating couple on whom Chinnamasta stands or leans to be lying on a cremation fire. There are also examples of Chinnamasta having intercourse with Siva while he lies on a cremation pyre and she decapitates herself (see figure 24).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With this in mind, then, let us now turn again, briefly, to the Śaiva and Buddhist Tantras and to the ritual employment of the prasenā. The Niśvāsaguhya, the Tantrasadbhāva, the Cakrasaṃvarapiṇḍārtha, the Sekoddeśa, the Bṛhatkālottara, and, most importantly, the Jayadrathayāmala (JY), the latest and most compendious of these texts, present a complex intertextuality.68 So, it is fair to present a composite account of the ritual of svasthāveśa.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The texts state that the prasenā is a divinatory form assumed by a female deity (vidya) that appears before the practitioner during a ritual performed at a site sacred to Maheśvara (rudrasthāna) or in a temple to the goddess (mātṛgṛham). The practitioner, called mantrin, māntrika, or simply sādhaka, repeats (japa) relevant mantras one hundred, one hundred and eight, one hundred thousand, or five hundred thousand times. This empowers him to undertake the āvesa. In these Tantras this ritual is always presented by Śiva, sometimes called Bhairava, as a great and wondrous secret, in response to queries from his dialogic counterpart, the Goddess, who is given a large number of names. As a result of these mantra repetitions, a conjunction (saṃyoga) is forged with a prasenā, classified as a Vidyā or Mahāvidyā goddess. This assumes a kind of communication, in which the mantrin either becomes fully identified with the prasenā or gains control of her. The JY declares that the mantrin possesses a special reverence, which is a result of meditation properly performed on this highest śakti (feminine energy). In a statement reminiscent of later Tibetan esoteric Buddhist initiatory practice, the JY states that this śakti arises in one’s belly on the disk of the moon, and it is here that the mantrin accesses her, in waves.69 The practitioner becomes established in a divine body (divyakāyasthitaḥ) and is able to perceive the expanded significance of a single point (bindumandiram).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this connection, it is relevant to reprise an observation by A. K. Ramanujan on Nammāḻvār, the great Tamil saint whose poetry predates by several centuries the works of Vallabhācārya and Rūpa Gosvāmī. Nammāḻvār “speaks frequently of being entered, filled, taken over, enslaved as well as enabled by a divine being,”48 characteristics of possession found in contemporary ethnographies. Although Nammāḻvār wrote in Tamil, this description could be extended to many Sanskrit authors. In this way, bhāva adds a dimension of emotional intensity to the Vedic āvesa, in which the (ostensible) instigator is not the possessor but the one being possessed. Āveśa and bhāva tew appear to share this feature, except that bhāva adds a dimension of emotional clarity and direction to the āvesa.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As pointed out earlier, most Indic possession can be spun from the MBh: from the tales of two kings, Nala and Kalmāṣapāda, who experienced very different kinds of possession; from the story of Asvatthāman, arguably the most heinous villain in an epic with an outsized cast of reprehensible characters; from the protective possession of Ruci by Vipula Bhārgava, the composed and dutiful, yet inscrutably uncertain, pupil of the powerful sage Devaśarman; and from the tale of the birth of Skanda, which for millennia has served as the exemplar for certain demonologies in āyurvedic and tantric texts and, doubtless, in popular culture as well. Fictional though these characters may be, they connect directly to enduring features of South Asian religious and narrative culture, both Sanskritic and non-Sanskritic. Possession by the Skandas, the bālagrahas or childsnatchers, or other allied invasive agents of negative possession are not addressed further here, as I have dealt with them sufficiently. Nor do I address further the topic of possession identified as escalation of emotional engagement, except to emphasize, first, that it too can be traced in considerable measure to epic discourse and, second, that devotional possession, a form of intense emotional engagement that has its origins in a culture of mixed classicism, folk religion, and a probable early layer of shamanistic practice, has been explained in Sanskritic and certain folk cultures in terms of Sanskritic aesthetic categories.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Any discussion of a possible formal aesthetic of possession based on classical theories of Indian poetics (alaṃkāraśāstra), the central element of which is cognate, in spirit at least, with what is known in Western scholarly discourse as audience response theory, must be addressed more fully after an evaluation of possession in devotional religious practice and an appraisal of Indian demonologies (bhūtavidyā). These are discussed in Chapters 9 and 12. However, it is important to begin this discussion here, because more than anywhere else, except perhaps in the more technical and inaccessible literature of Āyurveda and Tantra, possession is revealed in fiction and drama to be a conspicuous feature of popular culture, if not always well regarded among the literati. Explicitly fictional material, which we might define in the Indian context as narrative works with no pretense to direct representation of religious or cultural history,23 should, then, be more proximate to the realm of aesthetic theory than most other genres of Sanskrit literature. So, let us conclude this chapter by referring to some of the categories of mood and emotional construction, as well as audience response, in works of classical poetics, principally the Nāṭyaśāstra of Bharata, noting possible resonances of these in possession performance as reckoned in both classical literature and modern ethnographies. I should emphasize that this is highly speculative, because possession, as mentioned at the outset of this study, finds almost no place in any formal sastra or epistemologically circumscribed field of knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Chapter 8 explores possession in Sanskrit and other classical Indic fiction, drama, and aesthetic theory. In the same way that the 1973 film The Exorcist and Henry James’s 1898 novella The Turn of the Screw influenced (and were influenced by) the Western—particularly the Anglophone—imaginaire in its views and experience of possession as a nasty and terrifying phenomenon (discussed in Chapters 2 and 3), stories of possession in India influenced its experience and occupied a major place in the Indian imaginaire. The evidence from Chapters 4 and 12, discussing the language of possession and extensive demonologies, testifies to this. But the influence and experience was not all of a “negative” sort, as tales of possession—especially from the Mahābhārata, the text with the greatest influence of all—did not simply create a psychic locale for dumping one’s worst fears and (one hopes) imprisoning one’s most terrifying ghosts. In addition, these tales opened the psychic doors to possibilities of oracular, divine possession, which is subsequently taken up by different genres of Sanskrit, Middle Indic and modern Indian literature; the tales are a major reason why possession is the most common and, at the grass roots, most valued form of spiritual expression in India.+++(4)+++&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After this volume went into production, two films dealing with spirit possession were released that deserve comment here because they illustrate the point of the title of this book. One was an American film, The Exorcism of Emily Rose; the other was an Indian film, Paheli (The Riddle).&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; What is striking about these films is their representation of the self possessed. Emily Rose was founded on the assumption of a naturalized, identifiable, and unitary self that was breached by demonic possession. This replicates the standard view within Western culture, even if it is belied by the very fact of, for example, acting (as in a movie) or role playing, which presupposes a fluidity, multiplicity, or even nonexistence of a fundamental identity on which personalities, or even persons, are constructed or superimposed. Another standard Western view, also casually supported by this film, is that possession can only be sinister, demonic, and evil. All of these assumptions are called into question in the present study.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As a group, the Mahāvidyās present a curious collection of goddesses. If there is an internal coherence to the group that explains how its members are related to each other, it is not readily apparent. Neither in textual sources nor in the contemporary oral tradition have I been able to discover an obvious pattern or logic to the inclusion of these ten goddesses in the same group. There are hints in some texts, and some of my informants have speculated about the question. These hints and speculations cover a wide range of possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Because of the ubiquity of the piśāca, a few words must be said about it. An illuminating passage appears in the Nīlamata Purāṇa (NP), a text from Kashmir that depicts a social and spiritual universe densely populated with ethereal beings of nearly unimaginable variety, which readily interact with one another as well as with humans. These beings comprise devas, gandharvas, apsarases, yakṣas, guhyakas, kinnaras, nāgas, rākṣasas, piśācas, and millions of others.181 Pisācas enjoy an honored place in this pantheon. They roam the heavens and the earth, including the rivers, mountains, towns, and forests of Kashmir. Indeed, the geography of Kashmir is vividly portrayed, rendering this Purāṇa a valuable source of historical knowledge. It is also a handbook of popular festivals and astrologically based rituals. Although recent efforts have been made to historicize the NP, much work remains to be done.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The question arises as to whether we can justly assume that the primary Indian source materials are in fact the basis of the practice of svasthāvesa found in China or whether China had its own indigenous sources quite apart from the Indian ones. To take this one step further, we can ask whether the advent of svasthāvesa and similar divinatory practices in India might be explained as borrowings from China, which, it is well known, had a rich history of such practices. Although I believe that we may preemptively reject this, the question arises because Davis cites Tang texts of the seventh and eighth centuries that agree almost verbatim with the Indian Śaiva and Buddhist texts that may be slightly later in composition. Furthermore, the epigraphical evidence cited above, though clearly linking the northern Saiddhāntika tradition with similar traditions farther south, fails to specify practices, as we have seen. An objection might then be raised concerning the provenance of these practices, especially because the earliest reference to svasthāvesa in South Asia, in the absence of other data, appears to be in the Harṣacarita, a text almost precisely contemporaneous with the earliest Chinese material. With this in mind, we should settle any lingering doubts regarding the matter of the direction of transmission.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Oracular possession in the Himalayas is very common. Daniela Berti reports that in Himachal Pradesh nearly all the village temples in Kulu district have mediums who are possessed by the main temple deity.74 The situation appears to be little different elsewhere across the Himalayas, from Ladakh to eastern Nepal. This is equally the case in Tibet, as Per-Arne Berglie notes: “Even more than the local lama … the dpa’ bo [spirit medium, lit. “hero”] acted in the centre of the religious life of the village.”75&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Possession is often interpreted as an expression of social control, or at least its attempt, a category that includes political power. Within this broad category of interpretation are almost innumerable variations that have been much pursued by anthropologists in the past several decades. Although control is exercised both actively and passively through political enforcement and cultural ideology, these interpretations have emphasized the active or performative aspects of possession and their roles within implicit psychological, social, and political contexts. This political influence in South Asia, however, is hardly felt because, despite the widespread practice of possession, it has not gained sufficiently broad formal recognition to influence religious or political bodies, as it has, for example, in certain places in Africa where possession argues much more visibly a politics of identity based on a sense of colonialist victimization,105 or in Tibet where the Nechung oracle has had a history of influencing the politics of the Dalai Lamas.106&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In spite of an official absence of an inherently existent self in Buddhism, personhood nonetheless persists, as discussed earlier. As Gombrich has remarked, “the anatta doctrine has no more affective immediacy with regard to the next life than with regard to this.”38 In practice, the person in Sinhala Buddhism, the topic of Gombrich’s appraisal, is as porous as any other in South Asia, as the work of Gombrich, Kapferer, and others testifies.39 To further demonstrate the extent of this porousness, it is instructive to examine briefly some of the lexical evidence of possession in Indian and Tibetan Buddhist texts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Related to nyāsa are pratiṣṭhā (establishment of a deity in a material object), attested as early as the vedic Brāhmaṇa literature and, more specifically and recently, praṇa-pratiṣṭhā (installation of vital breath [prāṇa] into an image of a deity).66 The relatively recent Tantrarāja Tantra (2.39–40) notes the possible loci of pratiṣṭhā in the case of the goddess: She can be established in a cakra (viz. a yantra), a disciple, or a fashioned image of herself. Pratiṣṭhā and prāṇapratiṣṭhā are (when they can be distinguished) intricate brahmanical rituals as well as the immersion or pervasion of deities within physical objects. Like nyāsa, these actions share conceptual territory with āveśa in that they engage positive forces (viz. deities), are induced by the performers, and are highly regulated.67 Interestingly, one of the older citations of prāṇapratiṣṭhā is from the Brahmāṇḍa, Purāṇa (3.30.4; fourth to tenth centuries C.E.),68 where it refers to the restoration of life to a corpse. Generally, however, it involves rites that infuse life breath and open the eyes of a deity. This transformative process occurs in both Sanskritic and non-Sanskritic ritual.69 An example from a recent ethnography of Tamil possession states: “Periyānṭavar’s divine essence (murtiharam) is transferred to the earthen body through an ‘eye opening rite’ (kaṇ tiṟappu). Beyond a cloth screen a musician paints with black charcoal the pupils of the god’s bulging eyes. When a camphor flame is waved before his face, the crowd cheers ‘Kovintā! Kovintā!’ the cry that always greets the reincorporation of gods in human bodies.”70 This cry, “Kovintā! Kovintā!” (Govinda, Govinda), is common in Tamilnadu when possession is invoked.71&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The notion of a “person” distinguished from a “self” was initially, if vaguely, proposed by Marcel Mauss in his final but seminal essay, “Une catégorie de l’esprit humain: la notion de personne, celle de ‘moi,’” written in 1938.55 Since then, philosophers and anthropologists have inquired further into these categories. This distinction is important in problematizing possession, especially in India, where the oppositions person/self share conceptual territory with the indigenous categories puruṣa/puruṣottama and ātman/brahman, and in early Buddhism with the terms attabhāva (Pali &amp;lt; Skt. ātma-bhāva; individuality) and puggala (Pali &amp;lt; Skt. pudgala; person). Consideration of these terms, especially of the paired opposites puruṣa/puruṣottama and ātman/brahman is advisable for establishing the ground on which possession may be understood in Sanskritic discourse. Only through such consideration will it be possible to comprehend the discursive context, for both scholarly and Indic categories, of the question “What or who is possessed?”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is striking how central female imagery and women are in Mahavidya and related tantric materials. Theologically, the goddess, or Sakti, in one form or another is equal or superior to a male deity or principal, usually Siva. She is usually identified with the origin of the cosmos and is said to infuse it and contain it. Frequently in Mahadevi texts she empowers the male gods to create, maintain, and consume the creation, or she undertakes these functions herself. Iconographically, the individual Mahavidya goddesses are shown dominating male deities. Kali and Tārā stand on, sit on, or have sex astride Siva. Other Mahavidyas sit on male corpses. Tripura-sundari sits on the body of Siva, which in turn rests on a couch whose legs are four male deities. None of the Mahavidyas is shown in the role of a traditional Hindu wife or consort. Even Laksml, who is widely known for her loyal and subservient position as Visnu&amp;rsquo;s wife, is shown alone. It is also noteworthy that the severed heads that decorate the goddesses&amp;rsquo; bodies are male, as are the corpses that lie beneath them. When animal sacrifice is included in worship, male animals are offered.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Related to possession and sometimes nearly indistinguishable from it, as we have seen in reviewing vedic passages on speech (vc) and sustenance (rjam), is a notion developed with considerable sophistication in the middle vedic texts and Upaniṣads. This notion may be labeled “transfer of essence.” This topic is vast and fraught with pitfalls, including proximity to early notions of karma (the pervading influence of the moral quality of one’s action on the individual as a whole),83 its overlap with the often-discussed epistemological strategy called bandhu or bandhuta, linkage of one phenomenon, entity, being, notion, or concept with another, based on phonological similarities, numerological equivalences, or other formal principles,84 and the subsequent invitation into the minefield of transactional models for human (and nonhuman) action. We can barely pause to deal with the first and second of these, but will gradually unfold the third, for which McKim Marriott and Stephanie Jamison have worked out effective models, albeit separately: Jamison did not consult Marriott’s work in constructing her transactional model of vedic sacrificial ritual in her book Sacrificed Wife/Sacrificer’s Wife.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Strickmann and Davis cite several texts that contain material strongly reminiscent of Indic and Tibetan āveśa and svasthāvesa. Indeed, the Chinese employ the word aweishe  a direct transcription of āvesa, “to designate possession rites in which a spirit was invoked into the living body of a medium. The term might also apply to procedures in which the spirit of a living person was co-opted, so to speak, into the pantheon.”94 Strickmann and Davis cite a large number of passages, including one from the Amoghapāśasūtra,95 which strikingly resemble Orofino’s description of childhood possession in the Tibetan Subāhuparipṛcchānāmatantra. According to Strickmann, the Amoghapāśasūtra, which was translated from Sanskrit into Chinese around the end of the seventh century, was the first Chinese Buddhist text to give instructions for inducing deity possession. It was at this point, says Strickmann, that a “new Tantric synthesis was about to become known in China”96 The purpose of this aweishe ritual, which invokes Guanyin (=Avalokitesvara), was therapeutic, to heal an individual suffering from spirit-induced illness. The passage is not an isolated ritual option, but occurs in a more general discussion of ritual healing. The entire passage is worth citing:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Chapter 9 places possession in the context of devotional practice. This is perhaps the most important aspect of possession, as the intensity of personal engagement is revealed in both text and practice to be the signal determining feature in personality identification. And in India bhakti it is nearly always linked to an intensity driven by a single-minded love for the deity. Thus, in the context of devotional practice, personal identification with a deity is often interpreted as possession. The primary textual locale for this is late first-millennium Sanskrit and Tamil bhakti literature, eventually extending to Hindi, Marathi, and other regional literatures. Although this narrow, interiorized, single-minded (ekāgratā) focus is ostensibly resolute and impenetrable, it is, in South Asia, indicative of the porousness of the self and the fluidity of personhood.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>06 Childsnatchers and Therapy to Counter Demonic Possession</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;(Piśacagṛhītabhaiṣajyam)191&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A section from the MBh (3.216–219) on the birth of Skanda and the origin of bālagrahas or childsnatchers was explored in Chapter 6. That passage contains much of the essential information found in the āyurvedic texts, including specialized works on pediatrics, descriptive lists of bālagrahas, diseases attributed to them, and remedies. Perhaps the most comprehensive of these passages appears in the Kāsyapa Saṃhitā (KS) of the seventh century, a text that now survives in only two fragmentary manuscripts, testifying to the fact that it was soon eclipsed by other texts, particularly the AH, despite sections like this one that are more comprehensive than the corresponding sections of the later texts. The passage in question is intact and has been translated well by Dominik Wujastyk.192 For this reason it is not necessary to enter into a full translation of it or corresponding texts.193 The important point is that the fundamental interpretation of the action of grahas, including bālagrahas, at least in the classical āyurvedic texts (we have seen that the perspective in the Tibetan medical texts can be different), is that they are agents of possession. Other symbolic interpretations of the meaning of grahas and verbs used to describe their actions (such as abhigharṣayati [attack]) may be valid as well,194 but they cannot override the centrality of possession or of moral missteps (even if inadvertent) or weaknesses that are consistently seen to lie at the basis of disease-causing possession. The KS describes many conditions, moral lapses all, ideologically consistent with what is found elsewhere, in which the archetypal childsnatcher, Jātahāriṇī, invades a pregnant woman and terminates her pregnancy. As expected, “only dharma can turn her away,” says the KS.195&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Despite the preceding discussions, it must be stated that possession was barely a blip on the philosophical screen in India. It was not problematized or thematized on its own merit, and when it was addressed at all it was out of necessity, because the authors of earlier texts mentioned it. When it was regarded categorically (as has always been the wont of Indian sastra), as it was in the Yogasūtras and Brahmasūtras, possession was assigned fuzzy ontological or soteriological characteristics rather than epistemological ones (perhaps Hemacandra and the Yogavāsiṣṭha aside). It lay within the realm of active human experience, an area prone to ontological and soteriological categorization. It was not presented as a topic germane for philosophical analysis in part because it was not considered empirically reproducible. Thus it was not a philosophical notion that could even awkwardly be assigned its own niche in philosophical composition. In this way, it lay at the periphery of such discourse, which, at least within the advancing genre of sastra, employed soteriology only as a framing device within which philosophers could address more pressing epistemological symmetries. But, as elsewhere in Indian literature, it forced its way in asymmetrically, haphazardly. Neither Yoga, Vedānta, Jainism, or Buddhism could easily discard the realm of human experience from their discourse, dealing as they purported to with notions of enlightenment or, more precisely, release from individually forged bondage to the nettlesome and ever-recurring phenomenal world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;39&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Erndl 1996:178. See Daniel 1984:227 on the impossibility of studying a culture in its own terms, but for its own terms. We must keep Daniel’s caveat in mind throughout this study.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Eliade 1969:339, also 320; cf. Eliade 1964:411ff.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Eliade 1969:339; Lewis 1989.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;In a different context, Benz (1972) distinguishes between emotion (Ergriffenheit) and frenzy or spirit possession (Besessenheit). Ergriffenheit indicates blessing, healing, renewal, while Besessenheit indicates malevolent and destructive possession); cited by Schoembucher 1993:241–42.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Fuller 1992:231.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I explore the vocabulary and senses of possession in both their “microstructures” and “macrostructures,” as elucidated by Gonda 1962: “There are ‘microstructures’: ‘meanings’ which are complex, consisting of semantic aspects, grouped round a ‘kernel’; there are also ‘macrostructures’ or ‘fields’ composed of groups of words which are in some way or other—morphologically, notionally, etc.—more closely associated” (p. 245); also Gonda 1970a:177–178.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I cannot treat this fully this here, so it must be reserved for a future article. But see, e.g., BhP 4.7.26, cinmātram; 5.12.11, jñānaṃ viśuddham; 5.19.4, viśuddhānubhavamātram; 8.18.12, avyaktacit; 10.51.57, jñaptimātram.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Were I to struggle for a definition of consciousness in the present context, I would begin by revisiting the discussion of over a century ago by William James in Varieties of Religious Experience (1958:140–156), in which he considers it an open-ended, responsive, and adaptive mental activity.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The philosophical analysis of consciousness is problematized differently in the fields of neurophysiology and cognitive science. The questions raised by neurobiologists ultimately involve behavioral and cognitive function. But, asks David Chalmers, a cognitive scientist, why is it necessary for these functions to be accompanied by conscious experience? This question remains unanswered, but the issues it raises are now being addressed by physicists, neuropsychologists, geneticists, information theorists, and an array of metaphysicians. Chalmers (1997) sees an explanatory gap between physical processes and consciousness, which, he posits, may be negated (if not closed) by considering consciousness as an independent, irreducible, fundamental property in a final “theory of everything.” As such, awareness would be defined as physical and objective, while its psychophysical counterpart, consciousness, would not. See also Black, Flanagan, and Güzeldere 1996.&#xA;I should acknowledge that “states of consciousness” have different constructions in the contexts of South Asian philosophical and religious textuality: deep sleep, dream, waking, or, in the Upaniṣads and elsewhere, turīya, a fourth transcendent state. It has also been construed as a momentary finite unit connected by time or innate tendency. Elsewhere it has been regarded as identical with thought, with the thinking I; as the central product of embodiment; as an event connected with embodiment but not necessarily limited to it, and so on. Much modern anthropological and philosophical reflection on the term draws on Merleau-Ponty’s now rather quaint view (1962) that consciousness derives from embodiment. As noted in the previous paragraph, the questions asked today are nuanced differently.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Taylor 1998a.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Winquist states, in partial introduction to his article in that volume on the concept of person: “It is a commonplace in scholarship to recognize that words, ideas, or concepts are embedded in historical and cultural settings and cannot be isolated or abstracted without being misplaced, or translated without accounting for the transformation of or the difference in the cultural milieu into which the word is rendered or onto which it is inscribed” (1998:225).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Halbfass 1988:388–402.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Proudfoot 1985; Sharf 1995, 1998.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Sharf 1998:111.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cf., e.g., Yogasūtras 1.11, 4.4, and Vyāsa’s commentary. Opposed to this is, e.g., Chāndogya Upaniṣad 7.26.2. For a good description of memory in brahmanical thought, see Caraka Saṃhitā, Śārīrasthāna 1.148–151.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Sharf writes elsewhere: “The notion that the term ‘experience’ is self-evident betrays a set of specifically Cartesian assumptions, according to which experience is held to be immediately present to consciousness. It would appear that the phenomenological transparency of consciousness—what Richard Rorty has called the ‘glassy essence’ or ‘mirror of nature’ picture of mind (Rorty 1979)—is reproduced in the conceptual transparency of the category ‘experience,’ obviating the need for definitional precision or critical analysis” (1995:229).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Mauss 1938 [1966]. The volume in which the English translation appears, in The Category of the Person, ed. Carrithers et al., is dedicated to unpacking the legacy of Mauss’s essay and includes one article dedicated to the “person” in South Asia (Sanderson 1985:190–216). Less Indological, but more anthropologically informed, is Carrithers (1985:234–256).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Critiqued by Allen, in Carrithers et al. 1985:26–45. See also Lynch: “it suffers from its evolutionary framework, which can be read as putting the Western idea of the fully individualized self as the height of progress, rather than as a different idea of the self” (2003:474).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Translation of Mauss 1938 by W. D. Hall in Carrithers et al. 1985. This deceptively simple statement may be used to counter in part the tired (and tiresome) idea, caricatured from Dumont, that Indians have little or no independent self-identity, only a corporate or systemic reflexivity.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Sanderson comments on Mauss: “What is striking in his cursory treatment is not so much his evolutionism as the inadequacy of his evidence and his lack of sociological and historical perspective” (1985:190).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Mauss 1938:18.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;See Shulman 1994:26f. I address Shulman’s views more fully in dealing with the Mahābhārata in Chapter 6.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;This is explored more extensively below; cf. Marriott 1976.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Csordas 1994:14.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Winquist 1998:229.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;On ātman (self), its relation with nara (person), and its use dialogically by Abhinavagupta, see Dupuche 2001.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;See Larson and Bhattacharya 1987:73f.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cf. Kaṭha Upaniṣad, 4.12,13, 6.17; Śvetāśvatara Up. 5.8; etc.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Gonda 1965:266.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Collins 1982:160, 172, for mention of an ‘inner soul” (abbhantare jīva), used conventionally, in the Milinda Pañha.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The texts Collins exploited were the Visuddhimagga, Dīgha Nikāya, Nettipakaraâa, Anguttara Nikāya, Saṃyutta Nikāya, Paramattha-joṭikā, and the Katthāvatthu. The latter is discussed in Cousins 1994, which relates Vasubandhu’s representation of the Vātsīputrīyas, a remnant sect of early Buddhism that maintained a certain pudgalavāda view based on the coalescence of the aggregates or skandhas. See also the references cited in ibid.:28n6.&#xA;In Jainism, poggala is an ontological category that denotes particles of matter or basic constituents of nature. These can be aggregated, recombined, and transformed to yield substances (davya &amp;lt; Skt. dravya) that may serve as a locus for a jīva. But they do not in themselves bear the weight of a person or personality. Cf. Deleu 1970:145, 183f., passim.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;See Clifford 1984:148ff.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;See, for example, the work of Parpola, who has often speculated on the origins of the Sanskrit epics (e.g., 2002). Parpola sees a mid-first-millennium B.C.E. migration of pale-skinned (pāṇḍu) Iranians who migrated into India, integrated with the local population, legitimated themselves by fabricating genealogies that situated them in ruling families, and finally disseminated tales of their exploits. Few Indologists will easily subscribe to this theory, but it demonstrates that consideration of the MBh as fiction remains an ongoing enterprise.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Morris 2000:125.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cuneo 2001 discusses this phenomenon extensively. In contemporary South Asia, the Bollywood film Aks (2000) has many of the same themes. It was not a particularly good or successful film and had little impact on Indian popular culture. The film Bhoot (2003) was somewhat better but similarly left little imprint. Much better and more successful was Paheli (2005); see preface above.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Bloomfield 1917:7.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Tawney 1901:9–10. The text reads: bhūpaḥ prāharike dvije nijagajasyāṅge ’viśad vidyayā | vipro bhūpavapur viveśa nṛpatiḥ krīḍaśuko ’bhūt tataḥ | pallīgātraniveśitātmānaṃ nṛpe vyāmṛśya devyā mṛtim | vipraḥ kīram ajīvayan nijatanuṃ śrī(vi)kramo labdhavān || Sometimes talking parrots narrate lengthy tales, including those of possession. See the Sukasaptati, stories 46–47, and the translation by Haksar 2000: 150–154.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;See Parkinson 1991, who distinguishes “apparitionist” from “non-apparitionist” interpretations of the existence of ghosts. In the former, they are viewed as veridical manifestations of paranormal reality, while in the latter they are regarded as subjective hallucinations. Parkinson maintains that James did not adopt either stance, but was neutral on the issue. Nevertheless, his work profoundly influenced later writing on ghosts, possession, and the paranormal.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A highly recommended example of possession in contemporary Asian fiction appears in the first volume of Osamu Tezuka’s (1928–89) six-volume phantasmagorical manga comic on the life and times of the Buddha; cf. Buddha Vol. 1: Kapilavastu (2003:311–356). This work illustrates the process of constructing a story line from elements of popular culture grafted onto historical narrative. Tezuka devotes considerable space to characters of his own invention, including Chapra, a slave boy born as a sūdra, who in his wanderings meets a pariah boy named Tatta, who has the power to possess the bodies of animals and then have them do his bidding.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;On the topic of authenticity in Indian ritual, which is to say the argument that what is closest to an original or archetypal form is most authentic, see F. Smith 2001b. I cannot here enter more deeply into the extensive recent discourse on the power of the image and the status of representation. For this, one must study the works of Derrida, particularly his notion of différence (1976), his essay “Plato’s Pharmacy” (pharmakon) (1981), and his meditations on mourning, esp. the chapter on Louis Marin (2001:139–164). Marin argues that the virtue of the image is its reference to its own constructed, derivative nature.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Parpola 1998:278–280; for the text, see KSS 75.34–57, 188; 98.60–74; 99.1–30.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Echoes of this continue to appear in the popular tantric imagination. See, e.g., Svoboda 1986: ch. 1.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Translation based on Emeneau 1934:106ff. Compare this with tale 22 of Vetālapañcaviṃśati of Śivadāsa, “Of the Yogi Who Went from One Body to Another” (Śivadāsa 1995:164–167). This is roughly the same story, but here it is a brahman named Nārāyaṇa who had studied the art of entering the body of another. The discourse varies slightly, and there is no mention of a dead body or a smasāna. Both Jambhaladatta and Śivadāsa (eleventh to fourteenth century) postdate the KSS version (1070 C.E.).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;See Granoff 1998a:222. Near end of this story, the Jain rendition of the tale of Nala and Damayaṃtī, “Dhanna hastened to his house and quickly returned with the milk. Filled with devotion, he gave the great ascetic milk to drink to break his fast.” This version becomes so whitewashed that it has none of the possession of the MBh original.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cf. Harootunian 1988 on early modern Japan.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;See Bloomfield (1917:9f.), who contends, wrongly, that notions of āveśa began with yoga philosophy and that philosophy and fairytale conspired for “the complete obliteration of the boundary line between fact and fancy” (p. 3). “Nothing is impossible,” he adds, “where the canons of time and space and number, and of every sobering empirical experience have been undermined by such a travesty on scientific thought” (ibid.).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cf., e.g., Kasulis et al. 1993:39–145; more generally, see Bynum 1994, Sheets-Johnstone 1992, and especially LaFleur 1998, on the topic of the body in the study of religion.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The cultural resonances of this with the Doonesbury cartoon characters Boopsie and Hunk-Ra (see Chapter 3) are perhaps not too far-fetched.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;See Lockwood and Bhat 1994:32.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Compare this with the central theme in Brinkhaus 1987.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I am reminded of Henry James Sr.’s declaration in the 1870s (I cannot remember the source) that individualism was a better idea for men than women because social order depended on women’s willingness to give up “selfhood.” Willing or, more likely, otherwise, the anthropological record bears this out. Indeed, abandoned selfhood, at least selfhood as thought about in the West, does contribute to possession.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Pūrvapīṭhikā, pp. 42, 44; e.g., p. 42: yakṣāḥ kaścid adhiṣṭhāya bālacandrikāṃ nivasati, p. 44: bālacandrikām adhiṣṭhitaṃ yakṣaṃ balavantam.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Daśakumāracarita, part 2, p. 176: aham asmi bhavajjāmātā bhavadanumatyā vinā tava kanyābhimarṣī.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Examples of works we must exclude would, then, be the MBh, Rām, Purāṇas, Brajbhāṣā vārtā literature, with the caveat noted with respect to the MBh.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;See Chapter 11 and Inden et al. 2000. Despite Inden’s methodological overkill—banning the words “religion” and “ritual,” among others, from his book, which results in clumsiness and obfuscation rather than clarity—the authors’ use of inscriptional and historical sources represents a step forward in historical analysis of South Asian cultural and religious textuality.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Lutz 1988:54.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ibid.:4.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;See Bynum 2001:39ff., for an inquiry into wonder as emotion, based on medieval Christian writings. In constructing a theory of wonder, Bynum subsumes within it terror and disgust (among others), which in South Asia are regarded as independent emotions. She asserts that the “wonder-reaction ranges from terror and disgust to solemn astonishment and playful delight” (p. 57). Notwithstanding the excellent work of Lutz, Nussbaum, Lynch, and others, a great deal remains to be done on the study of emotions across cultures.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The most accessible discussions of rasas and their enumeration are Masson and Patwardhan 1969 and Raghavan 1967; cf. the discussion in Chary 1993:55–61. See also Raghavan 1978:427–433, 438–453, which addresses the question of bhāva. Bhoja regards all bhāvas as rasas, in disagreement with Abhinavagupta, cf. ibid.:283–285). With respect to the salvific value of rasa, Bhoja says of śṛṅgāra: yena śṛṅgarīyate sa śṛṅgāraḥ (it is itself the peak and takes men to the peak of perfection). The third stage of rasa is called by Bhoja uttarakoṭi, which synthesizes all the scattered bhāvas within the ahamkāra and turns them into prcman, a stage of divine love. “In this stage every bhāva is a kind of love, preman, and every kind of love is a love of ātman, ahaṃkāra, abhimāna, or śṛṅgāra” (ibid.:440). Thus, Bhoja’s rasa theory is called śṛṅgārādvaita in the Sāhityamīmāṃsā (ibid.:458; Sāhityamīmāṃsā, p. 161).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;This is the translation in Ingalls et al. 1990:68ff. Abhinavagupta brings out the character of the word itself, which should be translated literally as “one with a shared heart.” On sahṛdaya, Abhinava says that it “denotes persons who are capable of identifying with the subject matter, as the mirror of their hearts has been polished by the constant study and practice of poetry, and also who respond to it sympathetically in their own hearts” (ibid.:70). See also Hardikar 1994.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;On this, note the discussions in Chapter 2, of the early seventeenth-century Danish missionary to Malabar, Bartholomaeus Ziegenbalg, and the twentieth-century missionary in Panjab, Wayne McClintock.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Lutz 1988:63 (emphasis in original).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ibid.:65.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Lutz recognizes that emotions might also bear a positive, humanizing value. She writes: “[E]motions are associated, in their positive but secondary sense of the engaged, with the spiritual and the sublime. To have feelings is to be truly human, which is to say, transcendent of the purely physical. Whereas emotions stand in close relationship to the instinctual when contrasted with cognition, they emerge as opposed to the animalistic and physical connotations of the instinctual when contrasted with what can be called the spiritual death of estrangement” (ibid.:66). This, she notes, is the position in American culture. In Indian culture, though, as we can see here, the subjectivity of emotion (or mood) becomes objectified and subject to positivistic categorization. The engagement of emotion and mood with the “spiritual and the sublime” does not mark them as truly or authentically human, but truly and authentically divine as well, and not only “transcendent of the purely physical” but deeply implicit within it.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;See Gray 2004:4n12 for discussion of its place in the Kanjur.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ibid.:4–5.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Knipe 2001. Halliburton is, thus, incorrect in assuming that “popular consumption of elite philosophy may be what makes Kerala unique” (2002:1126). Again: “[W]hat may make Kerala unique is that these elite philosophies and phenomenologies seem to be popularly consumed” (p. 1130); and more specifically: “What Kerala has that other states do not—and what makes its phenomenology unique—is the popular consumption of what would be considered only elite phenomenological discourses in other parts of the country” (p. 1131). The responses to Kṛṣṇa and Rām lilā should also be included in this reckoning (as specified below). Halliburton has cast a very small net then made a dubious claim based on it. In short, his understanding of Indian philosophy and regional cultures is not commensurate with his profound command of anthropological theory.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Childhood possession, including of Vīrabhadra, is the main topic of Chapter 11.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;See Biardeau 1989a; Hiltebeitel 1988, 1991.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;See Coburn 1984, 1991.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Knipe 2001:344.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ibid.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ibid.: 348–349, 351.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I am especially indebted to William Sax for discussion on this and some of the following points.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ramanujan 1986a: 69–70.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cf. Hawley 1981:13, 61.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;See Wulff 1984:20–21 for the differences in emotional comprehension of a Kṛṣṇa līlā performed in Vrindaban and the classical Sanskrit dramas of Rūpa Gosvāmī, one of the foremost exponents of canonizing bhakti as a rasa.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;See Aṣṭāṅgahṛdaya Saṃhitā 6.4.24 (PP. 495–499 below), for a description of a person possessed by a brahmarākṣasa.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cf. the litany to Rudra in the Krṣṇayajurveda that names those of whom he is the lord: e.g., spirits, dogs, thieves (Taittirīya Saṃhitā 4.5.1–11). See Staal 1983:1:512–525, for a description of the rite in the agnicayana and the text and translation of the TS passage.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The offering to Rudra in the agnicayana consists of a stream of milk on the left-wing tip of the completed bird-shaped fire altar, not in the āhavanīya, the main fire into which oblations to the other gods are offered; cf. Staal 1983.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Hiltebeitel 1988:267–275 and Chapter 4.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;See Chapter 10, nn. 27, 32, 34.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Rich Freeman has elucidated this in many of his articles.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;See the remarks of Cort 2001:258.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;See the edition and translation of the Sanskrit: Yaśodharacarita, ed. Krishnamoorthy (1963:136, 206); for the English translation of the Kannada version, see Janna 1994:32–34. Jaina authors employ the word vyantara (Kannada bantara) to designate a class of nasty ethereal beings. Vāḍirāja does not use this word, but the story is told in Kannada today with the word bantara used for the spirit. (I am grateful to the late D. R. Nagaraj for this information.) The Sanskrit text uses the term nivāsitadaivam to indicate the possession, which the commentator glosses nivāsitabhūtagraham. For more on the topic of the miraculous as a mediator of karma (and disease) in Jainism, see Granoff 1998b.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Vallabhācārya’s enumeration of the chapters differs from that of most standard editions. This corresponds to BhP 10.30.24 in the text used in other sectarian traditions.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cf. BhG 8.5, 12.7; also F. Smith 1998b.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cf. BhG 1.28 kṛpayā parayāviṣṭho (filled with supreme tenderness); also 2.1; but 8.10c: bhruvor madhye prāṇam āveśya samyak (having properly focused the prāṇa between the eyebrows).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Trans. Ingalls et al. 1990:653.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;tvam eva paramātmasvarūpo viśvasāras tasya bhaktiḥ śraddhādipūrvaka upāsanākramajas tadāveśas tena tulyam api na labdham āstāṃ tāvat tajjātīyam; see also Ingalls et al. 1990:655. A sensitive study of the relationship between the words śraddhā, kṛpā, anugraha, and prasāda would greatly enhance our understanding of bhakti. Steps in this direction are: Bhattacharya 1971; Hoens 1969; Jamison 1996: 176–184. Bhattacharya and Jamison note, appositely for Abhinavagupta’s definition of bhakti, that in sraddhā the senses of trust and confidence seem to precede that of faith.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;For a succinct discussion of bhakti-rasa according to the Gauḍīya school of Vaiṣṇavism, see Haberman 1988:31ff. For bhakti as a rasa, see Haberman 2003:118ff., 141–153.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cf. Gnoli 1968:82f.n4; Raghavan 1978:440.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Abhinavabhāratī on the Nāṭyaśāstra; cf. Gnoli 1968:21, 82ff.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;For a full translation and explication of this text, see F. Smith 1998a.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Nirodhalakṣaṇa (NL) 12–13. Puruṣottama paraphrases this in his commentary on NL 14: the anxiety (udvega) produced by saṃsārāveśa may be remedied by constant and unconditional offerings to the Lord (sarvavastusamarpaṇarūpasādhana-).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;bhagavadāveśe bhagavaddharmā vyāpakatvādayaḥ tatra śruyante na tu jīvo vyāpakaḥ | Cf. Timm 1985:241. Better is Miśra 1971, a Hindi translation of the same text.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Bālabodha. 14; see F. Smith 2005.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Saṃnyāsanirṇaya v. 6.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Subodhinī on BhP 10.32.6–7 (Yugalagītā): āveśo devavaśaś ca pūrvanirūpitau | līlāveśo ’dhunā nirūpyate | (Āveśa as the influence of the deity has been explained before; now āveśa in līlā is explained).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Subodhinī on BhP 10.2.37: smaraṇena kriyāḥ purṇāś cittāveśaś ca tatra hi | jñānakriye yadā viṣṇus tadā mokṣo na saṃśayaḥ || See also Tattvārthadīpanibandha 45c–46b: vairāgyaṃ sāṅkhyayogau ca tapo bhaktiś ca keśave | pañcaparveti vidyeyaṃ yathā vidvān hariṃ viśet || (The fivefold knowledge through which a wise person may enter into Hari are dispassion, Sāṃkhya, Yoga, austerities, and love for Krṣṇa). The process of entering can thus work both ways: Hari entering the devotee or the devotee entering Hari.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;For the text, see F. Smith 1998a.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Lālūbhaṭṭa, in his Prameyaratnārṇava (cf. Das 1986:37), a Puṣṭimārga text of the late seventeenth century, cites Muṇḍaka Up. (iti śruteḥ) 3.2.9 in elaborating on this: brahmavid brahmaiva bhavatīti śruteḥ brahmabhāve sati bhagavaddharmāveśe jāyamānasya vyāpakatvasya bhagavadvākyaviṣayatvāt. The point here is that the experience of brahman (brahmabhāve sati) brings onto the devotee the qualities of the Lord (bhagavaddharmāveśa).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;This part of the Aṇubhāṣya was composed by Viṭṭhalnāthjī. Vallabhācārya composed the Aṇubhāṣya through sūtra 3.2.23, and the remainder was completed by his son; cf. introduction to the text by M. T. Telivala, the original editor (1927), reproduced in Śrīmad Brahmasūtrāṇubhāṣyam, Caturtho Bhāgaḥ.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;ayogolake vahnir iva tasminn āveśalakṣaṇaḥ sambandho ’sti |&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;yatra jīve svayaṃ bhagavān āvisati tadā bhagavadāvesād bhagavaddharmā api kecit tasminn āvirbhavanti |&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Handelman and Shulman 2004:40; see also Chapter 4, p. 128.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;De 1942:243. See also &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.indiadivine.com/avatara-incarnations2-y.htm&#34;&gt;www.indiadivine.com/avatara-incarnations2-y.htm&lt;/a&gt;, a Web site by Atmatattva Das that succinctly describes different lists of avatāras.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;De 1942:315–316.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ibid.:36ff., 564–572.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Translation of Sanjib Kumar Chaudhuri (1940), quoted in Hein 1972:110. See also Lutgendorf 1991:184, 199, for further examples of possession, especially of Hanumān, in Rām lilā performance.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Haberman 1988:72.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ibid.:75. See also Wulff 1984 for the importance of devotion in Rūpa’s dramas. Among the main themes in the Vidagdhamādhava are impersonation and disguise, distinctly on the other side of the fuzzy boundary demarcating possession.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;“Passion (rāga) is the state of being naturally and completely absorbed [paramāviṣṭatā] in the beloved; that form of devotion that consists of such passion is here declared to be Rāgātmikā” (Haberman 2003:76–77). Elsewhere, Haberman duly notes that “[t]he practitioner of bhakti, however, never identifies with Kṛṣṇa. This fact distinguishes bhakti from Tantric visualization and identification, where the practitioner does identify with the god” (1988:192n40). See Delmonico’s comments on the term paramāviṣṭatā in his review of Haberman 1988: “Āviṣṭatā is another form of āvesa, which means mental or emotional absorption in an idea or person. Thus, rāga or passion in the context of Rūpa’s discussion means a spontaneous or natural paramount absorption in the desired object, in this case Kṛṣṇa. Both Jīva and Visvanātha say that this state of absorption is an effect through which Rūpa means to point to its cause, a thirst or desire consisting of love (preman)” (Delmonico 1993:145). Rūpa’s meaning is that supreme emotional absorption in Kṛṣṇa is in fact the highest access to him.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Haberman 1988:89–104 discusses the different views of Rūpa Gosvāmī and the apostate Rūpa Kavirāja, whose views on embodiment constituted a heresy. His views were condemned by a council held in Jaipur in 1727, and he was subsequently forced to leave Vrindavan and live out his days in Assam. It is Rūpa Kavirāja who describes the siddha-rūpa as the “meditative body” (bhavanamayarūpa, antascintitarūpa).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Haberman 1988:89. He lists three other terms for this body: bhagavatī-tanu, vaikuṇṭha-mūrti, and mukta-puruṣa. A related doctrine is found in the Puṣṭimārga, in Harirāya’s commentary, called Bhāvprakāś, on the Brajbhāṣā vārtās or “histories” written by Gokulanātha, one of the grandsons of Vallabhācāṛya. These include the tales of the 84 disciples of Vallabhācārya (Caurāsī Vaiṣṇavan kī Vārtā) and the 252 disciples of Viṭṭhalnāthjī, Vallabhācārya’s second son (Dosau Bāvan Vaiṣṇavan kī Vārtā). Harirāya’s commentary and its doctrine of triple embodiment, called tin janma (three lives), requires further study. Briefly, however, the three janmas are the adhibhautika, the body of the individual before initiation into the Puṣtimārga, the adhyātmika or spiritual body reconstituted after brahmasambandha, the Puṣtimārga rite of initiation, for use in sevā and in discourse with other bhaktas, and the adhidaivika or divine body as a consort of Kṛṣṇa’s (e.g., Candrāvalī) adopted for use in the eternal lila, in Goloka.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;antaścintitābhiṣṭatatsevopayogidehaḥ; Haberman 2003:96n126.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;See Gold 1991:102–113, for an interesting discussion of the flexibility and interchangeability of gender in the Gopi Cand epic. See also Hancock 1995:85, who follows Ramanujan on the notion of the voluntary lowering of status from masculine to feminine in order to achieve bhakti, hence, possession.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Haberman notes that there are many manuscripts in Vrindavan that remain unexamined.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Hein 1972:109.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Caldwell 1996:204. It is perhaps natural that such folklore would arise, regardless of the historical accuracy of such incidents. Lucien Lévy-Bruhl uses the term “participation mystique” to describe the “ardent investment of the self in another object or person, as when a Zuñi dancer becomes the god whose mask he wears” (cited in Pesic 2002:148).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The eminent Indian archaeologist, Dr. M. S. Nagaraja Rao, a native of Mysore, informs me that his father, M. Srinivasa Rao (1900–1955), a noted actor who performed with a traveling troupe in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, and Tamilnadu for three decades, was best known for his role as Hanumān in the Laṅkādahana drama. In this play Hanumān leads the army of monkeys and bears to Laṅkā to rescue Sītā from the clutches of Rāvaṇa. Srinivasa Rao would prepare for this role by fasting and living a celibate life, qualities for which Hanumān was celebrated. He would break his fast only during the drama itself, after sacking Laṅkā, by dining on bananas, continuing his Hanumān bhāva.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;See also Collins’s remarks on bhāva (1982:156f.).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Humphrey and Laidlaw 1994:212.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;An example of the latter is found in Kathāsaritsāgara 1.2.59, mūrkhabhāva (the state of being a fool). The anthropomorphizing of emotion in India can be traced to the Ṛgvedic hymns (10.83–84) to manyu (anger). One can argue that this is an early description for what later was labeled bhāva.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;BhP 10.47.36. The sense of meditating on form is suggested by the verb anu√smṛ; cf. BhP 11.14.27.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;śravaṇād darśanād dhyānān mayi bhāvo ’nukīrtanāt | na tathā saṃnikarṣeṇa. Occasionally other terms are attested that indicate an intensity of experience usually associated with āvesa. For example, the Dasakumāracarita has the phrase upoḍhamatsarā prāvasan (consumed by jealousy).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Humphrey and Laidlaw’s term (1994:230ff.). Emergent moods, they say, “are culturally recognized psychological states cum physical actions which are available for people to switch into” (p. 233).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I have heard the term bhāvāves (in Hindi) used casually in Vrindaban.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Kripal 1995:39.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It is not clear to me whether the mistake is in Kripal’s transcription or M’s Bengali spelling; I do not have access to the original. The Bengali koṣas do not show āviṣṭha, only āviṣṭa; cf. Bandhyopādhyāy 1988:293.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Kripal 1995:340n63.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Lockwood and Bhat 1994. See also bhāvāveśa in Hemacandra’s Anekārthasaṇgraha (4.161).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ramanujan 1981:117. See Chapter 4 for the Tamil terms. See also Gold 1987:94ff. Vaiṣṇava texts, particularly those on Kṛṣṇa bhakti emphasize correctly generated bhāva, in which the bhakta is consumed by love for Kṛṣṇa. Also relevant here is the view of Śrī Aurobindo, who concludes, with respect to bhakti, that after enlightened realization has occurred, strenuous activity to maintain it is not necessary because “knowledge of the Divine takes possession of one’s consciousness on all levels” (Ghose 1971:307).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cf. Puruṣottamācārya’s commentary Vedāntaratnamañjuṣā on Nimbārka’s Daśaślokī (Brahmasūtra-bhāṣya viii–ix, 47–49).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Hara 1979a:270n56; also KSS 22.113, 95.23: madanāviṣṭa (madana = smara); 37.205, smarāveśavivaśa; also Rāmāyaṇa 3.44.13, 46.17: manmathaśarāviṣṭa (overcome by the arrow of Eros) (Manmatha is also identical to Smara, both being names of Kāma[deva], the God of love); Skanda Purāṇa 3.3.22.56: smarāveśa (excitement due to love); Matsya Purāṇa 154.246: nāveśaṃ samapadyata (not fallen victim to passion); Madanaketucarita 73, a mid-eighteenth-century text on erotics, has the term bhāvāvesāsnigdhatārā (love as total immersion in passion). See also Bṛhaddevatā 7.46–47, where pra√viś, a more logical choice for sexual entrance, is employed: bhagāntaram pravisya (having entered inside her vulva) (the Maruts entering the vulva of Ghoṣā), and above, chapter 6 notes. It is relevant to note that the visual depiction of complete swooning to the forces of interpersonal love, an acceptable kind of possession in India, is readily available in Hindi cinema. I suspect that this aesthetic has a long history; see, for example, the 1960 classic film Barsaat ki Raat.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Burrow 1979:283.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Trans. van Buitenen 1975:335.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;To the best of my knowledge, no text actively distinguishes samāveśa from samādhi. The former, it appears, indicates blissful pervasion by an external force, while the latter, in the Yogasūtras, the key text that defines it, suggests an internal pervasion that transcends relation.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Many other equivalent passages are found in the Yoga Upaniṣads; see the edition by A. Mahadeva Sastri.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;See Brown 1921:153ff. for further references.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cf. Csordas 1990.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;See the articles by Koller, Larson, and Dissanayake in Kasulis et al. 1993. These articles, which do little more than examine well-known canonical doctrines, abundantly reveal the truth of Gombrich’s observations often cited here that “brahmanism inculcates control.”&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Dissanayake 1993:39–40.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Staal 1993:71. See also Goodman 1990, who makes a strong case for a positive correlation between physical posture, spirit or deity possession, and states of altered consciousness.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The body as conceptualized in the ṚV and in India in general, as we have seen, occupied a surprisingly liminal space. Based on his analysis of the afterlife in the ṚV, Reat notes, “in Vedic thought the most essential element of the human being is his individual identity, which resides primarily in the quasi-material tanū” (1990:63). (In spite of the general absence of historical and linguistic surety in this book, Reat’s observations on tanū, at least, are sound.) This individual identity is a composite entity called ātmán in the ṚV and Yajurveda Saṃhitās. This is to be distinguished from the ātman of the Upaniṣads, where it becomes the microcosmic equivalent of the absolute brahman.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Staal 1993. His writing on ritual (e.g., 1983, 1990a) also demonstrates this point.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Tambiah speaks of Western “notions of bounded self and atomistic individualism” (1990:133) opposing the more fluid, transactional, and interactional notions of the self in Indian thought. On “fluidity” of the self in India, see Daniel 1984.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;See the discussion in Chapter 2 on the equal attraction of possession performance to ethnographers and enculturated peoples.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cf., e.g., Kakar 1982:238ff.; Koller 1993:52ff.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cf. Heesterman’s felicitous statement on the Vedic ritualist’s conception of the universe: “In this world of floating forms there are no hard and fast lines; conceptually different entities and notions interchange with bewildering ease. All things, entities, notions, powers, are connected with each other. Nevertheless this world is not the chaos it appears to be at first sight. The point at issue for the Vedic thinker is not to disentangle and differentiate conceptually different entities and notions but to realize, to know, their connections” (1957:6). See also Chapter 5, n. 80.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;This corporeal liminality is seemingly built into the Vedic language itself. Gonda observes with respect to the enigmatic power expressed by the word bráhman that it belongs to a type of Indo-European terminology that blurs the distinction between “nomen actionis and nomen rei” (1950:72), that is between action and object. This blurring, which is in fact a blurring of identity, is a characteristic of Vedic thought, and it is most visible in bandhutās such as these.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cf. Csordas 1990:1ff.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cf. Gupta and Ferguson 1992 for the related term, “free-floating monad.”&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Marriott and Inden 1977; see also Marriott 1990.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Appadurai 1986:755.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cf. Swami Vivekananda’s “vedāntafication” of the Ramakrishna Mission, amply demonstrated in Kripal 1995. See also Appadurai, who, summarizing Ashis Nandy’s argument (1983), writes that Swami Vivekananda “largely succumbed to the androcentric, linear, protestant, and activist strands in the dominant colonial culture” (1986:748).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Gupta 1995:10.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Robinet 1993:103.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Eck 1993:59.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ibid.:59–60.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ibid.:60.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Jung 1990:495, cited by Glucklich 1997:53.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Glucklich 1997:53.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;See also Orsi: “Western styles of knowledge, which typically give priority to detachment over engagement, to textuality over vocality, to mind over body, are to be exposed to radically different ways of constructing and inhabiting reality” (2001:109). This, he asserts, runs counter to the priorities of the “once-dominated” and “once-oppressed” other. Doubtless this is largely true. However, one of the facets of Indian orthodoxy is that this allegedly Western style of knowledge is also true of it, though one may argue that the facets of Indian orthodoxy that interested Christian-inspired Western intellectuals were the ones most framed in this manner. The reliance of mainstream brahmanical śāstra on reason and logic appealed to Western intellectuals, especially the discourses of Nyāya, Vedānta, and Theravada Buddhism. Poetics (alaṃkāraśāstra) was taken slightly less seriously, as was Purāṇa, and, of course, Tantra and bhakti literature. All of these were more embodied, vocal, and engaged, and were it not for the intriguing character of their antiquity, most of the vedic literature would have met with the same fate, as the oft-cited derogatory comments of Max Müller, Julius Eggeling, and others testify. For these, see Tull 1989, ch. 1.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cf. Kjaerholm, who states: “We do not really believe that a person can be possessed by spirits or the devil or what have you. Although this was a common belief in medieval Europe it is not generally held now, certainly not by social scientists” (1982:184).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;See Bynum 2001, which examines twelfth- and thirteenth-century narratives of metamorphosis and hybridity.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Recall Varahamihira’s warning (Chapter 11) to astrologers against the use of possession.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Yocum 1982:193.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Kripal 1995:271. Kripal does not distinguish between possession and ecstatic vision (72, passim). The Kathāmṛta 4.232 contains “a self-description of how the saint’s ecstatic states used to possess him like ghosts until he finally could expel them out through his bowels” (Kripal 1995:335).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Bhattacharyya (1986) also demonstrates this in her work on cultural configurations of insanity.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I have used the word “intermedial” for this state; see F. Smith 2004.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;In spite of the active participation of brahmans in non-brahmanic possession ritual, certain artifacts of brahmanical inhibitions remain in their performance. William Sax informs me that the bodies of low-caste people in possession gyrate more wildly than those of upper-caste members.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Bynum 2001:31.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Thus Gombrich can argue that “both brahmanism and Buddhism oppose possession and commend self-control, while the communal religion of the Sinhalese, as of the Indian, village centres, and has probably always centred, on a cult of local deities whose priests become possessed and so act as mediums to help villagers solve their problems” (1988:145).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Humphrey and Laidlaw see this at work in contemporary India as well, in the Jain stance towards emotional engagement in religious practice. They write, “The more puritan of our informants disapproved of [episodes of emotional engagement], in the same way, one imagines, that ‘enthusiasm’ was frostily dismissed in the eighteenth-century Church of England” (1994:228).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Pollock 1990:333.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Biardeau 1989a:21–22.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;White discusses “vernacular ritual strategies” in his undated and not yet published paper. This is not quite identical to what I am positing here, but the article presents more evidence of the influence of “vernacular” practices on Sanskrit textuality, thus broadening the perimeters of Sanskritic culture beyond what many, including Pollock, might contend. This effectively broadens the discourse of power in Sanskritic culture, reshaping at least these elements of it to reach beyond the Mīmāṃsā-laden orthodoxy.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Hiltebeitel 1989b:450. We might also here consider Haberman’s description (1988:98ff., 137ff.) of male practitioners of rāgānugabhakti sadhana who wear women’s clothes. This is not mentioned in any Sanskrit text before the eighteenth century, but its presence as part of the local tradition supports and strengthens Rūpa Gosvāmī’s textuality of this sādhana in the Bhaktirasāmṛtasindhu.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Thus, textual, performative, and religious traditions like those arising out of the Nāṭyaśāstra and certain Purāṇas and Tantras, as well as vernacular literatures expressing the same human religious concerns, may thus be correct in envisioning themselves as the fifth Veda. On this, see F. Smith 1994.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Miles 1997:59.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Shulman 1994:1.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ibid.:25.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;See the descriptions of the nāga in Chapter 12, from bhutavidyā accounts in Sanskrit and Tibetan medical texts. These, however, do not square with what we have here. This is not the place to enter into a study of nāgas; it is sufficient to note that they occupy a place of great importance in the MBh. Generally, they are depicted as water spirits who also possess the secrets of the earth. They are alternately dangerous, poisonous, and helpful, with a reputation for divination. They may be exotic serpents or half-human and half-serpent (as appears to be the case here). In Tibet the iconography is somewhat clearer. There a nāga is typically depicted with a divination arrow and a jewel in its hands (cf. Nebesky-Wojkowitz 1956:305).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The story is much less complete in the Rāmāyaṇa; cf. Rām 144.15ff., esp. verse 18, and Goldman 1984:210 and notes.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cf. Wadley 1999. This is perhaps not so odd, as the peripheral nature of this episode (ākhyāna) to the main action of the epic renders this aspect of it dispensable. Nor is it depicted in Draupadī epic performances in Tamilnadu or Garhwal. Neither Nala nor Damayantī are mentioned by Hiltebeitel in his Draupadī volumes or by Sax in Dancing the Self. As mentioned earlier, the Jain story of Nala excises the possession completely; he is an archetypal good king who ends up renouncing the world.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Shulman 1994:27.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;</description>

      <title>06 Possession and Shamanism</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Possession is often identified or compared to shamanism.115 The most important theorist of this relationship is I. M. Lewis, whose book Ecstatic Religion remains mandatory reading in the field. Lewis asserts that “possession is a culturally normative experience”116 in many places, a statement with which I concur with respect to South Asia. Like most anthropologists, he seeks to determine the social etiology and meaning of possession as well as its culturally determined psychological dimensions. He examines trance, ecstasy, hypnosis, and shamanism, ultimately concluding that the latter shares an important process with possession—a reciprocity between gods and humans. He posits a homogeneity between shamanism and spirit possession, arguing, contra Eliade, that “the Tungus evidence makes nonsense of the assumption that shamanism and spirit possession are totally different phenomena, belonging necessarily to different cosmological systems and to separate historical stages of development.”117 In drawing this equivalence, Lewis, whose model strikes me as excessively deterministic despite many virtues,118 delineates a wholly presumed and uncompromising functionalist sociology of possession states.119 In this he develops two contrasting psychosocial loci of possession, which he labels “central” and “peripheral.” Central possession, generally highly valued, supports prevailing political, moral, and religious beliefs and views spirits as sympathetic to these. Peripheral possession, an invasion of evil, amoral spirits, is undesirable and dangerous. Central possession, understandably, is a preserve of those of high status and power, while peripheral possession is generally associated with those who lack power and status. Although peripheral possession appears to be historically the preserve of women and those of lower social rank, it is definitively less so in recent times, as democratization, modernity, and the disappearance of Christian-dominated colonialism have freed educated middle- and even upper-class individuals and families to embrace the peripheries, bringing them closer to the center. In this way, economics, rather than ideology, caste, or other markers of purity or impurity, defines and situates power and status, at least in this orbit, by collapsing the boundaries between the periphery and the center.120&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Tantric or Vajrayāna Buddhism spread from North India, Kashmir, and Nepal into Tibet between 500 and 1000 C.E., as many scholars have shown. It was then enhanced in Tibet by the indigenous Bön and other local cults and cosmologies and by the spectacular environment that is Tibet, all of which have conferred on it a unique position among the various versions of Asian Buddhism. Among the unique features of Vajrayāna Buddhism is the importance of initiations, a legacy of the Śaiva traditions of Kashmir and northern India. It was not simply a matter of taking refuge in the Three Jewels—the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Saṇgha—but of receiving initiation into the practice of multiple Buddhist deities and maṇḍalas. Indeed, the path as conceived by Vajrayāna Buddhism was fueled by initiations. This is not to discount the complexity of tantric Buddhist doctrine, the subtle layerings of Buddhist philosophical thought, the profound sectarian differences, the importance of assiduous practice, or the complex relationship between lay Vajrayāna and monastic practice and institutions. But it was initiation—infusions of divine energy delicately forged by detailed attention to ritual—that motivated the remaining aspects of Vajrayāna Buddhism.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In Tamil and Simhala,99 āvēcam (&amp;lt; Skt. āveśam) is perhaps the most common word for spirit or deity possession. Like other South Asian languages, Simhala betrays a linguistic nexus between possession and emotion: the substantive ävitu (possessed [by an evil spirit], mad) is related to the verb ävissenavā (to be angry).100 Obeyesekere, however, recognizes a much greater frequency in colloquial Simhala of ārūḍe (&amp;lt; Skt. ārūḍha [mounted]), divine possession, “in which the magnetism of the god infuses and suffuses the body.”101 This is distinguished from the equally common preta dosa (misfortune caused by an evil ancestral spirit or preta).102 The definitions of āvēcam in J. P. Fabricius’s Tamil-English dictionary are: “1. spectre, ghost; 2. the entrance of a demon into a person for the purposes of uttering oracles; 3. the fury or madness of a possessed person; 4. the grimaces of a person in ecstasy, religious frenzy.”103 The Tamil verb pukutal (to enter) is used in Tamil poetry where ā√viś is found in Sanskrit or Sanskritized Tamil. For example, Tiruvāymoḻi 9.6.3 reads, “With gentle grace he conquers, and enters my heart” (nīrmaiyāl nencam vancittu pukuntu), and 9.6.5 reads, “As if he were going to show his grace, / He entered into me” (tiru aruḻ ceypavan pōla ennuḷ pukuntu).104 On the word aruḻ in the Tamil Śaiva texts, Handel-man and Shulman note:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If a single “being” or “entity” may be specified in the Vedas as more deeply implicated in possession than any other, it is, with the exception of the human being, the gandharava. A great deal has been written about this mysterious being since A. Kuhn first addressed the subject in 1852.139 Although it is not my job here either to recount the history of scholarship on the subject or to offer my own definitive account, it may be mentioned that most of the research during the first century after Kuhn’s article appeared was dedicated to speculations on the etymology of the word and its cognates in Greek, particularly kentauros (centaur). Early generations of Indologists labored to identify the gandharva as a cloud spirit, the rising sun, Soma, the genius of the moon, the rainbow, a wind-spirit, a horse or ass, or a giant.140 These identifications were set aside, at least as unilateral interpretations, by A. B. Keith and O. H. de A. Wijesekera, who questioned the linguistic connection with Greek and noted both the incomplete vedic and other Indic evidence brought by previous scholars and uncertainty regarding the deep history of the kentauros.141 The most sensible writing on gandharva to date remains that of Wijesekera,142 who sees connections of the gandharva with all the suggested “meanings” at different points, but none, he demonstrates, are valid as exclusive interpretations. As with most important terms, its meaning appears to have shifted slightly from the ṚV to the Upaniṣads and the Pali canon.143&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>06 The Potentially Liberating Nature of Social Antimodels</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Finally, the question remains: Why would one wish to identify with, to actually become (in the logic of Tantra), a goddess such as Kali, Chinnamasta, Dhumavati, Bhairavl, or Matarigi, each of whom dramatically embodies marginal, polluting, or socially subversive qualities? These goddesses are frightening, dangerous, and loathsome. They often threaten social order. In their strong associations with death, violence, pollution, and despised marginal social roles, they call into question such normative social &amp;ldquo;goods&amp;rdquo; as worldly comfort, security, respect, and honor. Seeking to identify with or become one with these goddesses suggests that the *sadhaka *in some fashion finds marginality, social taboos—the forbidden generally—spiritually refreshing or liberating. Wherein lies the potentially liberating power of what we might term social antimodels?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Mahāvidyās are approached in a variety of ritual contexts, and the worship of one Mahavidya may differ from that of others. Some of the Mahāvidyās, for example, have ancient and widespread cults that existed, and still exist, quite apart from the Mahāvidyās as a group. This is the case with Kali, Tara, Tripura-sundari, and Kamala, for example. In general, though, we can think of their worship as taking place primarily in two contexts: in temples, where they are served by priests and where people come to take part in public worship, and in temporary places marked off by individual aspirants, where worship is undertaken in tantric fashion, either right-handed or left-handed. Although temple and tantric styles of worship have some similarities, they are quite different in mood and style.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;***The **Widow **Goddess ***&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Dhumavati is ugly, unsteady, and angry. She is tall and wears dirty clothes. Her ears are ugly and rough, she has long teeth, and her breasts hang down. She has a long nose. She has the form of a widow. She rides in a chariot that has a banner on top decorated with a crow emblem. Her eyes are fearsome, and her hands tremble. In one hand she holds a winnowing basket, and with the other hand she makes the gesture of conferring boons. Her nature is rude. She is always hungry and thirsty and looks unsatisfied. She likes to create strife, and she is always frightful in appearance.1&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As important as it is to examine the categories and taxonomies of bhūtavidyā, it is equally important to examine the healing process. This involves investigating the broader dynamics of exorcism: ritual, pharmacopia, healers, and the interaction between healer and client. Some of this has been addressed above, in anthropological and other ethnographic discussions of the healing process.212 We shall here look more closely at selected passages from the vast āyurvedic and tantric material, mostly the former.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Scholarship on possession in Kerala is now emerging, thanks in large part to the work of Sarah Caldwell, Rich Freeman, and Gilles Tarabout. Caldwell explores oracular possession among worshippers of Kāḷi. She writes about the performance of mudiyettu (divine offering),154 in which the goddess Kāḷi battles the demon Dārika. Caldwell notes that Kāḷi “will enter the actor’s body and consciousness as a great inner heat”155 and reports an informant saying, “We fix the picture of Bhagavati in our mind, and her supernatural power (caitanyam) enters our body.” Freeman asserts that the tradition of spirit-possessed dancers and priests in Kerala dates back two millennia, before Malayalam had separated from the linguistic and political domain of Tamil Caṅkam culture.156 Observing the teyyam complex in Kerala,157 Freeman demonstrates that ritual structure allows for spontaneity and improvisation, even one that contains stock phrases and memorized text.158 He insists that ritually circumscribed possession experience exhibits learned, context sensitive encoded gestures and behaviors that are not invariant, but permit a degree of improvisation. This alludes to the issue of “faking” possession, which has been the subject of considerable indigenous discussion and which Meyer generously labels impersonation. Tarabout has written a comprehensive study of sacrifice and gift in Malabar festival life, a study that includes major sections on oracular possession.159&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;See Kelly 1998:173, and especially 188n6 on the problematic word Bewußtsein, probably better as “awareness” than “consciousness,” though Kelly himself has “reluctantly chosen the traditional term.” See my remarks in Chapter 1 on the use of the word “consciousness.”&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;For the problems surrounding this, see Clarke 1997:112ff.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Or, as Bloomfield writes, “penetration of one’s mind-stuff into the body of another” (1917:1). Cf. Caraka Saṃhitā, Śarīrasthānam 1.140, where āveśa is mentioned as one of the eight siddhis, and Bloomfield 1917:6, for other references. See also White 2004 on the sūtras discussed here.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Nāḍis are regarded as the scaffolding of the subtle body. Many nāḍis are believed to bear extraordinary power, if properly developed. For example, Ramakrishna “speaks of a special ‘memory nerve’ that develops after twelve years of celibacy. With such a nerve, the intellect develops and can comprehend God” (Kripal 1995:338n32). Elsewhere Ramakrishna says the “memory nerve” (medhā nāṛī) develops after holding semen for seven years (ibid.:67).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;This commentary that is well worth studying has thus far received virtually no scholarly attention. The only edition of the Yogasiddhāntacandrikā appeared in 1911.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;ghaṇṭābhighātatulyasya dedīpyamānāṇgārarāśidyuticañcalasya manaso ’pratiṣṭhasya śarīre karmāśayād bandhaḥ pratiṣṭhā.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Hara also suggests that “the object of entering is the seat of emotion, such as the mind [mānasa, citta] or heart [hṛdaya]” (1979a:263).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;kāyarūpasaṃyamāt tadgrāhyaśaktistambhe cakṣuprakāśāsaṃprayoge ’ntardhānam | Trans.

Cf. Merutuṅga’s Prabandhacintāmaṇi, p. 12:parapurapraveśa; also Pārśvanāthacaritra 1.576, 3.119. Hemacandra is regarded as a great siddha by the Jain tradition: It is said that he defeated another Jain, Devabodhi, in debate by floating in the air and manifesting the entire Jain pantheon and all the ancestors of King Kumārapāla; cf. Bloomfield 1917:2.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;See also a verse from the previous chapter of the Yogavāsiṣṭha, 6.1.81.56: “When the prāṇa is led into a state of stability for some time by engaging the practice of holding the breath at the end of an exhalation at the distance of twelve finger-breadths from the mouth, one can enter [praviśati] into the body of another person.”&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cited by Eck 1993:71–72.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;See Arya 1986:373 for the view cited in Nāgojī Bhaṭṭa’s commentary Bṛhatī that samāpatti is a vṛtti.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;On the Śaṅkara hagiographies, see Vidyasankar 2000. Bloomfield briefly describes the account in the Hindi Bhaktamāl (1917:10–11, through a French summary), which he erroneously refers to as the Bhaktimāl. This is clearly based on the Sanskrit hagiographies, to which Bloomfield, apparently, did not have access.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cf. Mayeda 1999:3 and notes.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cf. ŚDV 9.100: anaṅgaśāstra; 10.17: kandarpaśāstra.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Maṇḍana authored several major works of advaita (Brahmasiddhi), pūrvamīmāṃsā (Vidhiviveka, Bhāvanāviveka, etc.), and philosophy of grammar (Sphoṭasiddhi). It is likely that Maṇḍana lived slightly before Śaṅkara; cf. Thrasher 1979; and Raja 1991.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;ŚV, p. 179: liṇgaśarīramātreṇa ca sābhimānī (jīvaḥ) citigato nṛpakalevaraniṣṭhabrahmarandhraṃ prāviśat |. ŚDV 9. 104cd: mahipasya varṣma guruyogabalo ’viśad ātivāhikaśarīrayutaḥ || The word guruyoga refers to Yogaśāstra.

He carefully (śanaiḥ) entered (praviṣṭavān) the body of the king up to the toes (yāvac caraṇāgram).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;On Śaṅkara’s argument in his commentary on the Bhagavadgītā that only brahmcārins, and brahmans at that, are eligible for liberation, see Nelson 1993.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;mukhaṃ mukhena saṃyojya vakṣo vakṣojayos tathā | nābhyā nābhiś ca saṃkocya saṃkocena padāpadam || evam ekāṇgavat krtvā gāḍhāliṇganatatparaḥ | kakṣāsthāneṣu hastābhyāṃ spṛśan prauḍha ivābabhau || (ŚV, ibid.). The ŚDV, a more poetically accomplished text, provides a much grander rendering of his amorous loveplay and the coquettish behavior of the king’s many wives (ŚDV 10.12–16).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The recent publication in four large (and largely exemplary) volumes of Nimbārka’s commentary on BS with three commentaries and thirteen helpful appendices should vastly enhance future work on this little-studied commentator and Vaiṣṇava sectarian founder. Cf. Brahmasūtranimbārkabhāṣyam (2000).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I am unable to find any reference to this in the Vaiśeṣika. The nearest reference is Udayana’s Nyāyakusumāñjali (NKus) 230–8 (III), 239–6 (III): bhāvāveśāc ca cetasaḥ, referring to the absorption of consciousness in being. On the notion of bhāva in Vaiśeṣika, see Halbfass 1992:139ff . Cf. also Chemparathy 1972:93. In discussing proofs for the existence of Īśvara, Udayana comments on āviśya in Bhagavadgītā 15.17: the “āveśa or ‘permeation’ through which the Supreme Self ‘supports’ the triple world, as ‘the conjunction with a being that has cognition, desire, and effort’” (jñānacikīrṣāprayatnavataḥ saṃyogaḥ); cf. NKus 506.15.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cf. Olivelle 1998:272–273 (text and translation), 567 (notes); cp. Śvetāśvatara Upaniśad (Śvet Up) 1.4 and Olivelle’s notes, pp. 615f.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It is perhaps unnecessary to add that locating ethnographic support for this is difficult at best. Even possible literary support is closer to shape-shifting, in which, as we have seen earlier, a deity like Indra will create a unique form for a specific purpose.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cf. BS 4.4.17: jagadvyāpāravarjaṃ prakaraṇād asannihitatvāc ca |&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Trans. Olivelle 1998:429.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cf. Śrībhāṣyam, pp. 242–243.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;yathā gṛhādivyāptiḥ, tathā muktasya svaśaktitirodhāyakamalāpāye svaśaktyā viśvavyāptiḥ āveśaḥ bhavati |&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;TĀ 3.14: bhartā san bhriyamāṇo bibharti eko devo bahudhā niviṣṭaḥ.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;na hi tadā naisargikajñānakriyābhyāṃ tathā bhoktuṃ śakto bhavati kintu bhagavās tasminn āviśati yadā.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Recall our caveat on the use of the term “consciousness” stated in Chapter 1. The concept is multifaceted to the point of vagueness in contemporary usage, which in turn obscures Sanskrit words such as caitanya, citta, and bodha.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cf. Vedāntasāra of Sadānanda, p. 23, no. 17. For an occurrence of āveśa in a slightly different sense, see Gauḍapāda’s Māṇḍukyakārikā 4.56: yāvad dhetuphalāveśaḥ saṃsāras tāvad āyataḥ, in which hetuphalāvesa has the sense of “involvement in causes and results”; cited in Halbfass 1991:328, 345n146.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Gombrich 1971:243.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cf. Kapferer 1983, 1997; cf. Collins 1982 and the discussion in Chapter 1.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I have checked indexes, as far as they exist, for the Tripiṭaka and the Jātaka tales, the latter of which are in desperate need of retranslation.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Jātaka Together with Its Commentaries (1963) 3:511; see also 6:383. Cf. also Mahāummagga Jātaka: gahita-bhāvam (a state of possession) (Fausboll 1963: 6:383); also naradevo nāma yakkho gaṇhati (a yakṣa named Naradevo takes possession of me) (ibid.). The Jātakas are, of course, likely places for such occurrences, dealing as they do with life “histories,” rather than philosophical doctrine. For a few other similar references, see Woodward et al. 1956:345.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cf. Schmithausen 1987: 1:236–237, 2:552–566.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Yat tan niveśanaṃ kṛtaṃ tad āryā duḥkhato viduḥ |&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Le Mahâvastu (1882: 2:315): āviṣṭhaṃ gaditaṃ sa bhāṣati; note on p. 606: “pénétrant, perçant.” Jones translates: “penetrating and gushing is his speech” (1949: 1:263). Recently, DeCaroli (2004:25f., 128f.) has noted additional early Buddhist text passages on possession. In one tale “a yakkhi possesses a former monk, who was her son in a previous life, in order to get him to reenter the monastery” (p. 128). In another case, a Vinaya text explains that possession by a piśāca is sufficient reason to break the rain retreat” (ibid.).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;See Trenckner et al. 1960–90: 2:228; cf. the causative gerund āvisāpetvā in Theragāthā-aṭṭhakathā III.181.2: taṃ taṃ janaṃ (sisaṃ) āvisāpetvā attano gatiṃ kathāpeti (made the spirits of various dead persons enter their skulls and relate their rebirths).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;One can still refer with undiminished pleasure to Coomaraswamy’s studies from the 1920s and 1930s (1971, 1993). See also Sutherland, who believes that the terms rākṣasa, piśāca, gandharva, and yakṣa are often confounded and used interchangably (1991:49–61, for descriptions of different semidivine demons).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Edgerton 1953: 2:109.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Trans. Rothenberg 1996:147, text p. 56. Note the felicitous translation, “inspirited,” of āviṣṭaḥ. Cf. Jamison (1996:115), who speaks of “the inspiriting drink soma.”&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cf. Richardson (1993:50), who renders this lhabeb (lha-’bebs) (oracular possession).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I am grateful to John Dunne for this information.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;For a further discussion of these terms, see Chapter 10.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Samuel 1993:194. Recall the earlier discussion of dpa’-bo and references to the works of Berglie and Srinivas. See also the study of Tibetan oracles by Nebesky-Wojkowitz 1956:398–454, passim. For a good ethnography, see Kakar 1982:108–113.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Gray 2004:3.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ibid.:5.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ibid.:6.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;More or less in agreement with Stablein and Samuel, cf. Chapter 2, n. 133.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;See Nebesky-Wojkowitz 1956:100ff., 444ff. Recently another report of possession oracles participating in political processes in India came to my attention. In February 2006, in the northern state of Himachal Pradesh, nearly two hundred devtās (the local term for men and women who experience goddess possession and serve as official oracular representatives from villages in Kullu district) convened a possession congress in which they all entered states of possession and performed a special form of divination as part of the local political process. The issue at stake was the proposed construction of a ski resort for tourists. In their advisory capacity they overwhelmingly voted it down, strictly, I am told, because of the results of their divination while experiencing possession. According to my informant, a graduate student in English literature from Panjab University in Chandigarh, but a native of that region, the ruling stands. I intend to investigate this further.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;See the remarks in Germano and Gyatso 1998. An excerpt from their partial translation of the Nyingmapa Luminous Web of Precious Visions reads: “Upon the descent of blessings during his performance of the nonelaborate empowerment, the glorious and great Mantra Protectress [Ekajaṭi] descended into one of the yoginīs, and she began to perform. When everyone else became full of doubt, the lama said, ‘Because a ḍākinī has actually descended here [in her], get over your worries! I am a yogin who has realized the single flavor of appearances and mind, and thus no obstacles will ensue!’” (pp. 251–252).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;On the importance of this text, much greater than Tucci’s relegation of it to the category of minor Buddhist texts (see note 61), see Sarbacker 2001:16; cf. also Williams 1989:196–197.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;This chapter is a widely used meditation manual, recommended by the Dalai Lama; cf. Dalai Lama 2001. For the extraordinary lore that has grown up around the Bhāvanākrama (BhK), see Kapstein 2000:34, 220n71; Ruegg 1989; Tucci 1958. For an English summary of the first chapter, see Tucci 1958:155–182. On this chapter, see also Demiéville 1952. For translations of the Tibetan text of the second chapter, see Dalai Lama 2001 and Sopa et al. 1998. Regarding the third chapter, see Demiéville 1952:336–353, and for a lucid translation of it, see Olson and Ichishima 1979. An excellent study of the BhK and its sources is Gomez 1983. The soteriology expressed in this text is not limited to the BhK, a text of the Gelukpa school of Tibetan Buddhism; for another example see Buswell 1997.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;For the text, see Tucci 1958:211. In a continuation of the same passage the BhK cites a text called the Avikalpapraveśadhāraṇī (Incantantation for Entrance into a State of Nonrepresentation).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;For the text, see Tucci 1971:8. Recall the discussion in Chapter 1 on pudgala as “person.”&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Bhava and bhāva have the sense of worldly experience. Thus the BhK cites the Vimalakīrtinirdeśa Sūtra: upāyena bhavagatigamanaṃ muktiḥ (Living in the world with method is liberation) (Sopa et al. 1998:25). Bhava also indicates the quality or characteristic of a dharma or property of a thing.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Sarnath ed., 220; all references in the following notes are to page numbers in this edition.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ibid.: 204.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ibid.: 212. See Sopa et al. 1998:19.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;BhK, Sarnath ed., 214. Sopa et al. (1998) translate as follows: “When you see that your mind is tired, you should consider the benefits of meditative concentration and meditate enthusiasm” (p. 20). Also: tato viśramya punar api tathaiva sarvadharmanirābhāsaṃ samādhim avataret | (ibid.: 214) (After taking refuge, one should again enter into that samādhi which exposes all dharmas). Here the verb avataret (ava-√tṛ) replaces praviśet or even bhāvayet.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Sarnath ed., 214. The word pravṛttam here (translated as “embarked”) has the sense of entrance, fully entering inside a condition, equivalent to the BhK usage of praveśa (rather praviṣṭam).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;ata eva kevalaṃ śūnyatāṃ sevamānasya mā bhūn nirvāṇapraveśa iti | Tucci 1971:28. I thank John Newman for pointing out several of these passages.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Note the relationship between the concepts of response and responsibility as constructed by Derrida: “the activating of responsibility (decision, act, praxis) will always take place before and beyond any theoretical or thematic determination” (1995:26). A close examination of Indian philosophy reveals the same imperative, if somewhat differently configured, strategies of subsuming ethics to totalizing (or totalitarian) agendas.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Lewis 2000:47.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;YS 3.37: te samādhāv upasargā vyutthāne siddhayaḥ |&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;See Halbfass 1988: “Buddhism and other traditions which are built upon the insights and experiences of personal founders encourage their followers to aim at the same experiential goals, at re-living, re-experiencing the original insights. However, this does not imply that they ask them to re-examine or test the claims of the founders in an experimental fashion and to pursue their own consciousness research” (p. 393). Nevertheless, the history of spirituality in India reveals considerable variation and change within traditions and lineages.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;BhK, text p. 216; Sopa et al. 1998:24. Nevertheless, there are limits. The BhK continues: “The views of those who follow the path of sanctification [tīrthakamārga, followers of brahmanical sects] are totally without wisdom, in every way, because of their contrary views about the self and so on. Thus they cannot achieve liberation.” For the text, see Sarnath ed., p. 216.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The Bhāgavata Purāṇa 7.5.23 prescribes a number of practices organized around the theme of cultivating devotion. Some are to be practiced alone, others in a group.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;See Mumford 1989 on Ortner 1978: “she argues that in promoting a personal, ‘inner’ religious path, Lamaist ideology tends to isolate individual identity from the matrix of social ties, while shamanic identity remains embedded in the world of relations, even accepting spirit penetrations into the self” (p. 7). To see how this plays out in Mumford’s ethnography, see Mumford 1989:196ff.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Possession is understood as ontological or veridical reality by those who undergo the experience, which is to say as imposition or investiture on an individual personality of an independent and unseen external agent. This, of course, is the emic view, the narrative of indigenous tradition, the interpretation given to possession by the groups or individuals studied. This stands opposed to nearly all academic theorizing—to the emic narrative of scholarship. Nevertheless, it is an interpretation not wholly discarded by many ethnographers and others engaged in the issue. For most scholars who recognize, if grudgingly, the possibility of possession, this recognition is tactical, as a contribution to other theoretical agendas. The underlying assumptions of the social constructivist approaches that characterize most academic theorizing about possession—that issues and ambiguities concerning power and authority lie at the basis of much spirit belief and nearly all claims of unmediated possession experience—are being increasingly softened by scholars willing to find a way for their approaches to reconcile with indigenous notions that they find are all too often summarily dismissed. These scholars, most of whom occupy university positions in religion, psychology, and anthropology, are themselves, perhaps, rebelling against the possession–or, to put it more mildly, the enchantment–of their disciplines by modernity (or postmodernity). To transpose Geertz’s observation of cultures as possessing a “curious mixture of borrowed fragments of modernity and exhausted relics of tradition,” we might speak of contemporary academics sorting out for itself exhausted relics of modernity and borrowed fragments of tradition.143&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We must now briefly examine a few Sanskrit āveśa manuscripts found in the South Indian libraries. These manuscripts are quite ordinary in that they prescribe the construction of easily inscribed yantras or maṇḍalas that were likely in common use.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Other normative features are the recitation of bija mantras found in nearly all mantra collections (though they have their own unique order here), and brief statements of purpose and fruits to be gained (saṇkalpa). Although they have a standard format and structure, these manuscripts have unique content, as shown by a composite summary.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Chapters 10–13 address possession in Tantra and Āyurveda, discourses that must be examined together to some extent because they increasingly share the same intellectual context. It is here, for the most part, that the notion of possession as “grasping” or “seizing” (grahaṇa) is highlighted, “negative” possession brought on by a malevolent spirit (the influence of the Mahābhārata is also felt here). But this is only a part of the story, as it shares conceptual territory with the “positive” possession most often associated with deities, as well as with interpersonal possession found in texts ranging from the Ṛgveda to the Upaniṣads, the Mahābhārata (again), the Purāṇas, the texts of classical Yoga, and most other texts encountered in the earlier chapters.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What is revealed here is a continuum of practice from brahmanical to Buddhist, always with the underlying themes of physical divinization and multiplicity within an apparent singularity of personality. First, we briefly explicated the important term samāveśa, which occurs frequently in the Śaiva Tantras to indicate both the practice of immersion into a deity and the state of liberation that results from this practice. The unvarying requirement for these, the contingency that confers eligibility (adhikāra) for samāveśa, is tantric initiation. Second, we described the practice of nyāsa. In this practice, abbreviated mantras based on vedic models are employed to purify the five elements that constitute the body and all other materiality (bhutasuddhi). Subsequently, brief cadenced mantras are employed to compel deities and archetypal forms to enter the body, thus ontologically transforming and substantively re-indexing it. This process is complemented, even replicated, by the brahmanical practice of consecration and enlivening of images ([prāṇa-]pratiṣṭḥā), an ontological movement from inert material to sentient deity comparable to movement in nyāsa from the human to the divine.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We have already touched on the association of the Mahavidyas with magical powers, but it is so persistent that we should discuss it in more detail before turning to a treatment of the individual goddesses. Hindu literature is full of stories in which individuals, often demons, undertake ascetic and meditative practices in order to acquire special abilities with which they hope to achieve power, wealth, sex, or some other worldly pleasure or reward. In these stories, it is clear that they employ meditative and ascetic practices to attain selfish, worldly goals rather than what we might think of as spiritual ones. Texts on yoga say that one can acquire special powers *(siddhis) *by practicing yoga, but warn against indulging in them and thereby perverting the spiritual quest.89&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The usual way in which the Sanskrit texts dealt with negative possession was to identify and classify invasive spirits in demonologies, then to medicalize their possession. The most important and influential texts undertaking this are the foundational works of Āyurveda, as well as a number of Tantras. I offer new translations of the relevant sections of the three primary Āyurvedic texts—the Caraka, Suśruta, and Aṣṭāṅgahṛdaya Saṃhitās—which provide specific demonologies in the context of discussions of insanity (unmāda).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Much of the following is based on research conducted in Kerala in 2002 and 2004. I undertook this research after hearing a rumor from a usually reliable source that a number of āyurvedic physicians and tāntrikas (or mantravādins, as they are called in Kerala) still follow the practices of possession and exorcism outlined in the ĪŚP. On close investigation, I learned that this is not true. Nevertheless, it is likely that some of the current practices are derivative of what is found there or at least from a complex heritage of texts and practices that gave rise to the ĪŚP.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We must now discuss some specifications of possession in South Asia, including, first, the possibility of possession as a gendered phenomenon. In South Asia, as elsewhere, more women than men appear to experience possession. Important to understanding why this is the case, and perhaps always has been, is an evaluation of the constitution of personhood and sacred space in South Asia, for these are intimately linked in the physical and metaphysical complex of South Asian women’s possession. It is also necessary to discuss possession as performance, as this is also linked with the constitution of the person and relational space.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The procedures for employing children for divinatory purposes in India were not limited to a shadowy presence in a few obscure, regionally specific texts. This is similar to the situation in China, where it was relatively widespread, as Davis’s extensive documentation shows. However, even if the practice was not as widespread in India as in China, corroborative evidence from other Tantras shows that it spread beyond the confines of a few local cults. At any rate, knowledge of it appears to have entered into more mainstream Tantra sastra.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The Mantramahodadhi (MM), a popular and diffuse compendium of both dakṣiṇācāra and vāmācāra tantric practice composed in the sixteenth century by Mahīdhara,&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; includes several verses on this practice or on an adaptation of it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A literal translation of the term *mahavidya *is &amp;ldquo;great knowledge,&amp;rdquo; while a somewhat less literal translation might be &amp;ldquo;supreme (or superior or complete) knowledge (or wisdom).&amp;rdquo; There are several possibilities for what the name tells us about the nature and function of the Mahāvidyās. It is not obvious why these ten goddesses should have been so designated, but several explanations are possible.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have been told by two scholars of Tantrism in Varanasi105 that the term *dasamahavidya *as it applies to the ten goddesses is technical and means the &amp;ldquo;ten great mantras,&amp;rdquo; *vidya *generally being used in this technical sense in tantric contexts. In his commentary on the *Lalitd-sahasrandma, *Bhaskararaya says: &amp;ldquo;The difference between *Mantra *and *Vidya *is that the former has reference to male deities and the latter to female ones.&amp;ldquo;106 Indeed, the first order of business in many tantric texts that discuss or describe the Mahāvidyās is to give their mantras, which consist of a few syllables. The mantra, it is often said, is highly secret and extremely powerful. It is a given in the tantric context, in fact, that the mantra is identical with the goddess. It is not that the mantra *belongs **to *the goddess, which is the way one is often tempted to understand the relationship between the deity and the mantra; the situation, rather, is that the mantra *is *the goddess. Jan Gonda says: &amp;ldquo;The essence of a *mantra *&amp;hellip; is the presence of the deity: only that *mantra *in which the *devata *has revealed his or her aspects can reveal that aspect. The deity is believed to appear from the *mantra *when it is correctly pronounced.&amp;ldquo;107&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The recent major studies by Honko and Brückner of possession cults and epic performance in Tulunad in South Kanara District of Karnataka represent culminations in a long scholarly interest extending back to the Abbé Dubois in the early nineteenth century.166 The spirits invoked in the performance of the Siri epic are benevolent, which Claus points out “may be hard to believe” given “the incredible discomfort and agony evident in the bodily contortions and facial grimaces of the possessed young women.”167 Because these possession festivals (būta nemā/kolā) are similar to Teyyam in both Kerala and Coorg District of southern Karnataka,168 it is not surprising that in some cases the Tulu vocabulary was influenced by Malayalam. For example, Claus reports the phrase “darṣana169 had happened to so and so” (arugu darṣana ātuṇḍu). This is one of dozens of words in Tulu for spirit possession, which is not surprising given the Tulu recognition of the pervasiveness of spirits—evident from the studies of Honko, Brückner, and Claus. Claus reports the common expressions are bhūta pattuṇḍu (the spirit caught) and mayṭu battuṇḍu (came into the body),170 and Brückner reports nuḍikaṭṭu (oracular speech).171 Thus Tulu, barely a literary language, shares in the same locutions for possession found throughout South Asia.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In view of its proximity to Bengal, Nepal, Tibet, and the rest of northeastern India, the presence of a large (and largely unexplored) indigenous Tantric literature, and a predominance of worshippers of exotic goddesses, Assam might be expected to evince a substantial amount of possession. I have no doubt that this is the case. However, this has been almost entirely unresearched. What little is documented, however, is intriguing and requires a brief explanation that contextualizes this absence in terms of the political and religious exigencies of colonial (or colonized) Assam.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Because of the importance of astrology in Indian culture for at least two millennia, and because of the perception of planets as graspers or possessors (indeed, the Sanskrit word for “planet” is graha), I must also discuss passages from astrological texts, notably the Praśnamārga, dealing with possession. In summarizing the ritual and pharmacological aspects of exorcism recommended by various āyurvedic, tantric, and astrological texts, I bring into the discussion my own fieldwork on possession among these traditions as they are constituted in present-day Kerala.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The ten Mahāvidyās form a distinctive group of deities. Although it includes some well-known goddesses, such as Kali and Laksmi, most of them are little known apart from this group, and several of the goddesses are strikingly unusual (Chinnamasta, Dhumavatl, and Bagalamukhi in particular). The group does not particularly manifest characteristics and functions that typify *sakta *Hinduism, yet they are often said to represent the Mahadevi in her diverse forms. Several texts and secondary sources imply that they sum up, or circumscribe in some fashion, the main features of the Mahadevl. Nonetheless, the group lacks many features considered central to *sakta *theology and religion.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Beyond astrology, and beyond our concern with practices in Kerala, it is relevant to ask how is nija unmāda (mental illness with traceable physiological or psychological origins) distinguished from āgantuka unmāda (mental illness believed to be the result of possession)? In the case of nija unmāda, the vaidya takes a case history and undertakes a medical evaluation. In most cases, the cause is readily acknowledged: family problems, a death in the family, financial pressure, a life-threatening illness. The usual problems are depression and anxiety, as elsewhere in the world, and the unmāda is usually diagnosed as a vāta affliction and treated accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A major feature of possession known from ethnographic literature is its frequent occurrence in either religious drama or religious ritual (or both together). One need look no further than the recent work of Alf Hiltebeitel and Richard Frasca on South Indian street theater,185 Kathleen Erndl’s work on goddess worship in Panjab,186 and William Sax’s work on the Pāṇḍav Līlā in Garhwal to recognize the prominence of possession in contemporary religious drama.187 In the Pāṇḍav Līlā, for example, the actors or dancers are regarded as possessed by the characters whom they represent, such as Arjuna, Kṛṣṇa, or Draupadī. Indeed, as in the Kṛṣṇa and Rām līlās in Vrindaban, Varanasi, and elsewhere, the deities are themselves believed to be physically present, temporarily but fully manifested in the performers. This display of power and presence of the sacred permits the deities to be worshipped directly. Also documented is possession judged as higher and lower, positive and negative, not at all unlike the general distinction noted above between ā√viś and pra√viś in “Sanskritic possession.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The term svasthāvesa is attested in the sixteenth-century tantric compendium Tantrarāja (TR), brought to public notice by Sir John Woodroffe in 1918.132 This text presents a fairly close, if highly condensed, depiction of at least some of the material found in the early tantric materials and the South Indian manuscripts. The TR describes two yantras of the goddess and a ritual (TR 9.61–101), the most important part of which is the act of situating on one of the yantras a young girl who is to be guided into and out of svasthāveśa. The text speaks of the “performance” of svasthāveśa, an admission that should not be overlooked. The relevant verses state, “one should perform svasthāveśa” (9.76–78) on the first of the two yantras, because it is over this that the officiant recites the relevant possession mantras. The girl should then become identified with the deity, after which the officiant should burn a kind of incense called sarjjarasa. When she enters into the possession, the girl is worshipped reverently and with appropriate ceremony. Afterward, the client should ask for whichever objects are desired, upon which the girl will always reply fittingly. After being worshipped suitably, the deity becomes her, and after rites, such as sprinkling water, are performed on the first yantra the officiant causes the girls to disembark from their condition in which they are controlled by others.133 The Tantrarāja does not specify who these “others” are, and the commentary states, rather aimlessly, “piśāca, etc.,” apparently to qualify his previous assertion that it is a devatā.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The final chapter offers a few conclusions based on my years of living with this topic. The first identifies typologies of possession that are correlated with language use in order to elucidate the semantics, constituted within the sociolinguistics, of possession. Then follows a discussion of the influence of possession on notions of corporality and personal identity. Essentially, I conclude that possession was both a cause and a result of the generally accepted South Asian notion of a permeable embodiment. This notion, derived from a study of practice, is somewhat at odds with notions of selfhood developed in philosophical texts that have been adopted as canonical from the time of the Upaniṣads to postcolonial India. Perhaps not incidentally it is exhibited more consistently among women or at least applied more generally to women, in accordance with anthropological findings.+++(4)+++ However, our evidence demonstrates that such permeability is equally applicable to men, though in rather different configurations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After reviewing various definitions of possession, methodological approaches including those that study possession (1) as a negatively inspired religious phenomenon, (2) as a psychological event, (3) as a social or sociopolitical event that trades in power relations, (4) as a type of shamanism, and (5) as a “real” incursion of spirits or deities to be taken at face value and addressed with a full cosmological arsenal, and after examining possession as a gendered, situated, and performative experience, we are in a position to move forward in our study. As should be clear from the above remarks, I am not bound to any single methodological approach; indeed, I find all of them problematic, especially for a study that emerges for the most part from the literary record. Most of this record does not satisfy the requirements of thick description, as this was never the intention of the authors. Furthermore, possession as mentioned and described in India is exceptionally diverse in its perspectives and dates. Therefore, we cannot expect a unity of vision to emerge, nor a single methodological approach to work for all the material.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The recognition of disease-producing spirit possession in South Asia has an epochal history of more than three thousand years and an equally epic variation and complexity. It can be traced from the Atharvaveda, where unmāda was first discussed, to the early canonical texts of Caraka, Susruta, and Vāgbhaṭa, where diagnostics and treatment modalities were more formally discussed. Contemporaneous with these texts, it is discussed in the Mahābhārata and Buddhist medical treatises. From these sources it was dispersed to a variety of Tantras and āyurvedic texts beginning in the late first millennium and finally drifted into dharmasāstra and astrological literature. It will come as no surprise, then, that, given this deep history, the idea of negative, invasive spirits has not ceased in India. Rather, under the influence of thousands of years of new religious movements and sociopolitical formations, as well as updated scientific notions, it has been reconfigured and reintroduced in recent medical and paramedical texts, the latter represented by Tantras composed in the past few centuries. One of the chief characteristics of this history has been a flow of ideas on bhūtavidyā and bhūtonmāda from educated elites who control texts into the popular imaginaire and, conversely, from popular, non-Brahman, culture into texts. The juxtaposition of and exchange between classical and folk is, in fact, nowhere more evident than in the area of bhūtavidyā. It appears from the material presented copiously in the preceding pages that the banishment of the subaltern from much of classical discourse is a thin and tenuous construction or, perhaps more generously, an artifact of orthodox conditioning within the minds of both classical Indian and modern Western-trained scholars.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In spite of the efforts of Meyer, Erndl, Bhattacharyya, Stanley, McDaniel, Srinivas, Freeman, Claus, Brückner, Macdonald, Pakaslahti, Gellner, Vogt, Wadley, Caldwell, Inglis, Wirz, and a few others to highlight the importance of local terminology, many ethnographers fail to provide not only the vocabulary for possession but also the specialized words or terms for the person possessed. Let us now briefly look at some of the vocabulary in Hindi, Urdu, Gujarati, Bengali, Marathi, Nepali, Tulu, Tamil, Malayalam, Simhala, and the language of the Maldive islands.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;To complete the comparative aspect of this topic, an examination of svasthāveśa not only as a term for nonpathological possession but, more specifically, as oracular possession of children, we must offer more examples of this phenomenon in Chinese literature. Only then can the extent to which the Chinese material is derivative of the Indian be determined.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some compilations of Tang dynasty stories tell of children possessed by the spirits (shen) of learned men. Glen Dudbridge explicates several such accounts from a genre called zhiguai ( tales of the marvelous), one exemplar of which is the eighth-century Guangyi ji ( The Book of Marvels). In Dudbridge’s first story, a girl named Wang Fazhi from the town of Tonglu serves the spirit of a young man called Teng Quanyin, with whom she had an affinity in a previous birth; she begins to experience regular possession of his spirit before the age of five. In frequent meetings with the county magistrate, writers and poets, and Buddhist monks, Quanyin, speaking through Fazhi, demonstrates his literary, scholarly, and religious erudition, composing poetry extemporaneously.134&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;***The **Lotus **Goddess ***&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;She has a beautiful golden complexion. She is being bathed by four large elephants who pour jars of nectar over her. In her four hands she holds two lotuses and makes the signs of granting boons and giving assurance. She wears a resplendant crown and a silken dress. I pay obeisance to her who is seated on a lotus in a lotus posture.1&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let Kamala protect us by her wonderful side-glances that delight the heart of Visnu. She is seated on a lotus, has a smiling face, and with her four hands holds two lotuses and makes the signs of giving favors and granting assurance. Her complexion is like the brightness of lightning. Her breasts are firm and heavy and are decorated with garlands of pearls.2&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In lieu of decisive conclusions on this vast material, I instead pose a question: Why was possession induced in prepubescent youths? I cannot produce a confident reply; the answers lie in addressing both the nature of childhood and its various Indian and Chinese cultural constructions; in other words, both nature and culture. My initial impulse is to tread lightly on questions of culturally constituted psychology and the applicability of psychoanalytic theory, an impulse that should be evident from my earlier methodological explorations. I believe that, in spite of the efforts of Kakar and others, these areas have been insufficiently explored and I am particularly unqualified to offer a mature opinion on them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A recent exception is Padoux 1999.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Boddy 1994 cites 221 anthropological and ethnographic studies of possession, and this is far from complete as she cites only English-language sources.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Humphrey and Laidlaw 1994:261. The authors add, with respect to the notion that the purpose of ritual is cultural communication: “Our theory suggests that this is a mistake” (ibid.).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am grateful to Scott Schnell, an anthropologist, for this observation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I return to this theme periodically. See also Kapferer 1997:83, on the attraction to the anthropologist of sorcery in general. For a very different reaction, see Nabokov (2000), who admits to being so intrigued by possession and a séance that she witnessed one night at the beginning of her fieldwork in Tamilnadu that she spent the remainder of her research year attempting to understand what she had seen (pp. 3–4). By the end of the year, however, she claims to have “acquired none of the fascination that anthropologists working on possession sometimes develop for states of trance” (pp. 179–80). Her illuminating book provides the reasons for this; indeed, the reasons are embedded in the title, Religion Against the Self.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The composition was cumulative, dating from the second or third century B.C.E. to the fourth or fifth century of the Common Era. For a summary of the evidence see Wujastyk 1998:39–41. For a more precise dating of the core of the text to 50–150 C.E. and exhaustive evidence for this date, see Meulenbeld HIML IA:105–115 and references.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Caraka-sūtrasthāna (CaSu) 11.54, Caraka-vimānasthāna (CaVi) 8.87; also Aṣṭāṇgasaṃgraha-sūtrasthāna (ASaṃSū) 12.3; and Hārītasaṃhitā 3.2.3 for variants daivapathāśraya and yuktipathāsraya. On the word sattvāvajaya, see Murthy and Singh 1987, Shankar and Unnikrishnan 2004:168, and note 221 below.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;None of my informants knew the textual source of this verse, and I am unable to trace it. However, for a number of similar passages in Purāṇas and Smṛtis see Thite 1982:17–18. One vaidya told me that it is from a karmavipākaprāyascitta, or section on “expiation of ripened karma,” found in various Tantras and Dharmasastra texts. For more on karmavipāka, see the discussion below on the Madanamahārṇava.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Daiva, lit. “divine,” from deva, “deity,” has the extended (and usual) meaning “fate.” See CaSā 1.116: “Action that a person performs in a previous body is known as daiva. In time this also becomes the cause of diseases”; also CaSā 2.44: “That which is done in a previous birth is called daiva, while whatever action [karma] is seen in the present birth is called pauruṣa. That which is seen to be unbalanced is the cause of the onset [of disease], while that same thing brought into balance is the cause of its cessation.” Thus, daiva is contrasted with pauruṣa (human), from puruṣa (man or person); cf. CaVi 3.33–34.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Scant mention is made of sattvāvajaya, following the āyurvedic texts themselves.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Engler 2003:438 translates this as “science of demonic seizures.” This is a misunderstanding of the term.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;See Kleinman and Seeman (1998:237–252), who show, through comparative analysis, that religious healing is a form of moral practice. They write: “Calculations of locally defined utility, construction of self and cosmology, and the micro-politics of local social life are all central to healing as moral practice” (p. 251). This assertion is abundantly supported by the āyurvedic and folk texts and practices presented in this chapter.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;For example, CaCi 9.33:93–94. Zysk (1985:63) translates this as “accidental” and distinguishes it from madness caused by external agents such as gods, sages, deceased ancestors, and a variety of demons. My reading is that the latter are the primary agents of āgantuka unmāda. Zysk states the general theme as follows:&#xA;Causes of diseases are not attributed to physiological functions, but rather to external beings or forces of a demonic nature who enter the body of their victim and produce sickness. The removal of such malevolent entities usually involved an elaborate ritual, often drawing on aspects of the dominant local religion and nearly always necessitating spiritually potent and efficacious words, actions and devices.… The Vedic Indian’s attitude toward disease, therefore, was dominated by the belief that evil spirits, demons and other malevolent forces invade the body and caused their victims to exhibit a state of dis-ease. (p. 8)&#xA;See Zysk 1991:15 for another similar assertion.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Dash and Kashyap 1980:1. These authors, following Ṭoḍarānanda (hence the intellectual lineage of Susruta), divide Āyurveda into ādhyātmika duḥkha (śārīraka and mānasika), ādhibhautika duḥkha, and ādhidaivika duḥkha, employing familiar Indic hermeneutical categories.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;For convenient summaries see, e.g., Keith 1925:231–242; Oldenberg 1988:131–134. Bhattacharyya 2000 supplies much more detail in his diffuse and irregularly documented study of bhūtavidya; see esp. ch. 2 on “Vedic Demonology.” I cannot here enter into all the detail Bhattacharyya discusses, because the nature of the present project is to discuss only those bhūtas that are involved in possession, rather than all manner of vedic bhūtas.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cf. also Chāndogya Upaniṣad (ChU) 7.1.4, 7.2.1, 7.7.1. The best accounts of bhūtavidya are Filliozat 1937 and Sukla 1985. Filliozat’s remarkable work provides a succinct introduction to the topic (p. 24–28) and tracks bhūtas through a stunning array of texts, languages, and cultures. Sukla contains more data than anyone else, except Bhattacharya 2000, but he organizes it much more effectively. I do not here address postcolonial interpretations or what Langford calls the “narrative of decline,” in which Āyurveda has been subjected to a secularization process. As part of this narrative, bhūtavidya has been regarded by many indigenous scholars and physicians dedicated to discovering modern science in ancient knowledge as superstition or psychotherapy, and bhūtas as microorganisms such as fungi, bacteria, and viruses; see Langford 2002:85ff. and notes.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cf. Śāṇkhāyana Gṛhyasūtra (GS) 4.9.3, Asvalāyana GS 3.4.2; cf. also Pāraskara GS 2.12.2.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Dhaky 1984:240. His interpretations are often far-fetched, but he may be right to take bhūtas back to their roots in the elements, the bhūtas or mahabhūtas. He posits bhūtas as “elementals” and bhūtanāyakas as “captains of the elementals.” Cf. MBh 9.44.74–108; Matsyapurāṇa 53.1–46, 182.64–66, for physical features and other details of gaṇas, gaṇanāyakas, and gaṇeśvaras. The elements—earth, water, light, air, sky—have bhūtas and gaṇas (clans or tribes of the divine retinue) as their representatives, their symbols of noumenal and phenomenal reality.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;yás ta ūr viháraty antar dámpatī śáye | yóniṃ yó antár āréṭhi tām itó nāsayāmasi || (He who opens your thighs, who lies between husband and wife, who licks inside the womb; him do we cast away from here). On 10.162.4c, see Sāyaṇa’s commentary, yonim antaḥ praviśya āreḷhi niṣiktaṃ reto jihvayā āsvādayati, bhakṣayatīty arthaḥ. See Sharma 1972:99; also Zysk’s perspicacious rendering, 1985:51–53.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Mayaram 2001:215. See also, notably, Taussig 1987.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;For example, the case of Indra, the king of the gods, who becomes disfigured and degraded because of his untoward sexual advances on respectable women, or Śiva, who destroys Dakṣa’s sacrifice because of his exclusion.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cf. AVŚ 3.11.1, 20.96.6. On yákṣma, see Bahulkar 1994:129f.; Filliozat 1964:43f., 96; Zysk 1985:12–17.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;On the pravargya, see van Buitenen 1968; Houben 2000.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Āpastamba ŚS 15.19.4; Bhāradvāja ŚS 11.19.12; cf. Baudhāyana GS 3.7.27,28.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Āyurveda is often considered an upāṇga or upaveda of the AV; cf. e.g., Sukla 1985, in Sanskrit, intro. p. 10; cf. e.g., Aṣṭāṇgahṛdaya Saṃhitā (AH) 5.84; Aṣṭāṇgasaṃgraha (ASam) 7.118cd: daivavyāpāśrayaṃ tadvad atharvoktaṃ ca pūjitam. However, Wujastyk notes, “such medical material as is recoverable from the Vedic literature is remarkable more for its differences from classical āyurveda than for its similarities.… Of course there are some points of contact, but the overall sense is that, culturally speaking, āyurveda comes from somewhere else” (1998:17). Wujastyk’s translation of this chapter of the AH (ibid.:294–301) is the clearest exposition of its kind yet published. See also Meulenbeld: “In my opinion, Caraka’s list of sages, many of whom are known from Vedic literature, may have been inserted in order to stress the connection between āyurveda and the Vedic tradition, the orthodoxy of its teachings, and its association with the brāhmaṇa” (HIML IA:10).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;See also the commentary by Sāyaṇa, cited in Whitney 1905:1:17.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cf. Kausikasūtra 28.9 for a linked remedial rite against possession by evil spirits. The commentary on the KausSū explains that this rite is a mahāsānti called gāndharvī; cf. Bahulkar 1994:159f.; Whitney 1905:I:211.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;See Zysk 1985:52 and, especially, Bahulkar 1994:126f. for the ritual and pharmacological prescriptions of the KausSū and the commentary of Dārila, as well as a summary of scholarly opinions on the hymn. The hymn itself, AVŚ 2.25, is addressed to a pṛśniparṇ, a “spotted leafed” plant, which was used to help redress the condition.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;agna … sa gráhyāḥ pśān vi cṛta prajānán. Cf. Bloomfield 1894:cxix ff., 1897:521 ff.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;This is a much recognized and discussed aspect of healing traditions in ancient India. See, e.g., Bahulkar 1994 and Zysk 1985 for extensive discussions of this.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Beyer (1973:100) describes a Tibetan ritual in which the yogin makes a wax effigy into which he subjugates an enemy—a king or a demon are mentioned—by visualizing and bringing it into the effigy, which he then torments over flames and tramples.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Shukla 1980:135ff. and infra.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Zysk 1985:62.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ibid.:63, Sanskrit words added.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cf. AH 6.6.55cd: “One should examine the patient for supernatural possession. The signs which were earlier described as applying to madness appear exaggerated” (trans. in Wujastyk 1998:301).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Sanderson 1985:213n89.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ibid.:200.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ibid.:211n69.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ibid.:211–212n69, abhiniveśam is translated as “obsession.” Sanderson notes a further symbolic or, from the Indian point of view, adhyātmika reading in Jayaratha’s commentary.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Bahulkar 1994:160; his translation of amati- is “unconsciousness,” but this does not quite fit the context.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Weiss 1977. This remains unpublished, though the author is now preparing it for publication. For a comprehensive bibliography of works on unmāda, see Meulenbeld, HIML IB:65n93.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cf. Weiss: “The object of the present study is to gain an understanding of the psychiatric conceptual formulations of the early Indian medical authors in the light of Western nosology, and our interest in therapeutics is limited to the extent to which it serves to elucidate the diagnostic categories” (1977:3).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Meulenbeld 1997:186–198.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;One of the primary alleged causes of abhiṣaṅgaja disease is abhicāra (cf. Türstig 1985); that is, a bhūta that “sticks to” (abhiṣaṅga) a person is regarded as abhicāraja, sent by a hired sorcerer to possess the person. Cf. Dwyer 1998 and Chapter 4, note 35, and above p. 517f.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Lewis 1966:308 (reprint 1986:24).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Sanskrit lexicographers also acknowledge bhūtāveśa; cf. Trikāṇḍaśeṣa 3.230 and Hemacandra’s Anekārthasaṃgraha 4.161. The Rasaratnasamuccaya (5.2, 6.7), a thirteenth-century medical text prescribes a bhūtāveśapraśānti (procedure for pacifying possession by bhūtas). For further attestations of bhūtāveśa and piśācāveśa (and variants), see Kalhaṇa’s Rājataraṅgiṇī (c. 1150) 8.114.6 and the late dramas Vasantatilaka (c. 1800) 25.19 and Amṛtodaya (1710) 3.7, 3.18. Synonymous with āveśa is upahata (struck, afflicted); thus, also attested in the lexicons are bhūtopahata (afflicted by bhūtas); bhūtopahatacitta (the mind possessed by bhūtas); and, of course, the antidote, assuming the former: bhūtapratiṣedha (warding off bhūtas).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Other texts, many of them now lost, existed in both periods. See Meulenbeld HIML IA:689ff. (and notes), for a discussion of ancient authorities cited by Caraka, Susruta, Vāgbhaṭa, and their commentators, and HIML IIA:117–55 (and notes) for discussion of a number of other texts from the seventh to the eleventh centuries.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Meulenbeld (HIML IA:42) calls them “character types,” which is more accurate than “mental faculty,” “psyche,” etc., used by other translators. For discussions of the category sattva, see the many sources cited in Meulenbeld HIML IIB:82n112.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cf. CaSā 4.36–39, SuSā 4.88–98, Kāsyapa 28.8–36.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;For additional details, see Caraka Saṃhitā, ed. Sharma and Dash:3:416–420.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cf. also Śārṅgdhara Saṃhitā (composed around the beginning of the fourteenth century) 1.7.38. Meulenbeld states that this expansion represents an “incorporation of material from popular medical lore” (1997:189).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Thanks to Robert Svoboda, a trained āyurvedic doctor, for this information. On the relationship between bhūtas and apasmāra described in different āyurvedic texts, see Meulenbeld 1997:212–215.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;āveśo grahaduḥkādyair apasmāro yathāvidhiḥ bhūpātakampaprasvedalālāphenodgmādayaḥ (4.31); for references in other texts on poetics and dramaturgy see Haas 1912:119.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cited in Sabdakalpadruma.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;This is discussed in the Cidambara Māhāytma, a text describing the greatness of the Naṭarāja (Śiva) temple in Chidambaram, Tamilnadu; cf. David Smith 1996:222ff.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I present my own translations because I find that I differ with Weiss 1997 in a significant number of places.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;In a rather different vein, see AVŚ 5.4 and commentaries, in which hrūḍu, the secret name of the graha, is uttered to appease the spirit in charge of giving consumption (yákṣma) or fever (takmán); cf. Zysk 1985:53.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;One word for “comet” is upagraha; cf. MBh 3.216.1.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;For a good brief synopsis of the evolution of the application of the word graha to the planets, see Yano 2003:380ff.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cf AVŚ 19.9.7,10. See Caland 1926. Verse 10 reads: śáṃ no gráhāś cāndramas śáṃ ādityś ca rāhúnā | śáṃ no mṛtyúr dhūmaketúḥ śáṃ rudrs tigmatejasaḥ || (Weal for us be the planets belonging to the moon, and weal the sun with Rāhu; weal for us smoke-bannered death, weal the Rudras of keen brightness) (trans. Whitney 1905:2:914).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Bṛhatsaṃhitā 5.11; BṛS 5.13 reads uparāga (darkening) for eclipse; cf. also Bhāgavata Purāna (BhP) 5.24.3.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I am not able to find the words āveśa or praveśa in these contexts to indicate the sun or moon becoming possessed by Rāhu or Ketu (or vice versa). Rather, these two grahas assail (abhidhāvati, BhP 8.9.26, Rāhu only) or devour (grasati, MBh 1.17.8, again only Rāhu) their quarry, rather than “enter” or “possess” them. For references and discussion see, e.g., Bedekar 1967; O’Flaherty 1975:273–280. Although the word ketú is found as early as AVŚ 19.9.8–10, where the word appears to mean “comet,” its reconfiguration as the descending node of the moon occurs only in the early second millennium C.E.; cf. Gail 1980.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;This is consistent with the use of √gṛh in BĀU 3.3.1, 3.7.1 described above.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;For example, Bṛhatsaṃhitā 43.37. Cf. Bṛhatparāśara 84.17–20; Kane HDh II:749 ff.; Gaur 1979; Karmaṭhaguruḥ 74ff., 110ff. In the Purāṇas, see, e.g., Matsya Purāna 17.56, 24.46, 93.2ff., instructions for a grahahoma. On the growing importance of astrology in India during the first millennium C.E., see Inden 1992.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cf. Kātyāyana Śrautasūtra 9.14.14, Āśvalāyana Śrautasūtra 8.1.10.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Palsule 1967:11. On avatāra, see note 141 below.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ibid.:13.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Lutgendorf 1991:250, 322. See also Eck 1985:38.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cf. Bennett 1993.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;On its Tamil synonym aruḷ, see Chapter 4, p. 128.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cf. ṚV 7.103.4 (anugṛbhṇāti), where frogs kindly receive one another; 2.28.6 (anugṛbhāya), in which the supplicant implores Varuṇa to accept or extend his grace to him. Cf. Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā 25.8, AB 7.18.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;For dating, see Olivelle 1992:8ff.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;manyamānau ca kaumāraṃ puṣpitaṃ tadanugraham (KSS 1.2.76).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Devasenapathy 1983:10–11. Upadhyaya and Upadhyaya 1984:7 (cf. Honko 1998:251) speak of nigraha and anugraha in Tulunad, meaning the protective and punitive activities, respectively, of different spirits. Honko notes that the Siri epic was performed at possession rituals that were similar to bhūta rituals “with the purpose of supporting the mental health of participants with a history of illness” (p. 261).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;On this, see Zysk 1993.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Eventually Āyurveda was used to confirm Sāṃkhya. The Sāṃkhyasaptativṛtti, an early commentary on the Sāṃkhyasaptati of perhaps the sixth century, uses examples from Āyurveda to support its arguments. See Larson and Bhattacharya 1987:193ff.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;For these lists, and accompanying discussions, see ibid.:59~61, 161, 177, 206, 284. Larson’s speculations linking the eight realms of the SK to the eightfold prakṛti (p. 61) are thought provoking, but entirely lacking in textual support.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;For the use of some of these categories in the Mālinīvijayottaratantra, see Vasudeva (2004:326).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cakrapāṇidatta glosses abhidharṣaṇam as āveśaḥ and niyamavratādi as niyamety ādinā aihikaṃ karma devādyāveśakāraṇaṃ brute (by niyama, etc., worldly action caused by possession [āvesa] by gods and others is indicated). The term niyamavratādi may be a reference to Yogasūtras 2.30–32. In these sūtras the five yamas ([external] restraints) (YS 2.30)—non-injury, truthfulness, abstaining from theft, sexual continence, non-covetousness—are called mahāvrata (the great vow) (YS 2.31). The niyamas ([internal] restraints) listed (YS 1.32) are cleanliness, contentment, austerity, studiousness, and devotion to Īśvara. Āyurveda and Yoga have long claimed a connection, but hitherto it has been difficult to actually find textual connections between the two, especially for the early periods. However, a sixteenth-century text called Ayurvedasūtra, which closely links the two, was published in 1994. This late, and rather labored, sutra collection contains within it the entire text of the YS, interspersed with material drawn from āyurvedic texts. Whereas it is fairly certain that Caraka predated YS by several centuries, it may be assumed that many elements of the YS were well known long before the final compilation of the sūtra text. Thus, there is no reason that the yamas and niyamas, as well as other elements of the eightfold (aṣṭāṅga) path, which were quickly incorporated into yogaśāstra and may be found in Buddhist texts, could not have been known to Agnivesa or other compilers of the Caraka Saṃhitā.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;This verse is adopted as a basic definition of possession in many later texts; cf, e.g., Mādhavanidānam 20.17.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;On the evolution of the pitṛ in Indic thought, especially in the Harivaṃśa, see Saindon 1995.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;One wonders about the models on which some of these categories are based. Mozart, it is reported, would suddenly burst out laughing in the middle of a conversation, jump up and down, turn somersaults, and impulsively leap over tables and chairs.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Often the texts do not distinguish between waxing and waning fortnights. We must assume that both fortnights are assumed unless otherwise specified.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ḍalhaṇa: bhinnamaryādaṃ tyaktocitakramam abhakṣyabhakṣaṇe agamyāgamane; abandonment of propriety, such as eating what should not be eaten or going where one should not go.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ḍalhaṇa: sṛkkiṇyau oṣṭhaprāntau.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ḍalhaṇa: uddhasto vikṛtadarśanaḥ (deformed or disfigured). Verses 8, 9, 13, 15, and 16 contain the word juṣṭaḥ (pleased, welcomed, visited). This is a rather milder and more positive manner of speaking than Caraka’s equivalent verses: unmattaṃ vidyāt. Verses 10 and 11 read, for “possession,” paripīḍitaḥ; verse 12 reads abhibhūtaḥ; and verse 14 gṛhītaḥ.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ḍalhaṇa: adriḥ parvataḥ, dvirado (two-tusked) hastī, nago (non-moving) vṛkṣaḥ.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;After Ḍalhaṇa, who cites the variant reading vardhakena rather than vardhakena: vardhakena chedakena hiṃsārthinā kenacid graheṇa juṣṭo gṛhīta iti vyākhyānayanti.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;This apparently general description could also be an indication of oracular possession, which we have seen from the account of Pātañcala Kāpya and his daughter in the BĀU, was well known by then.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ḍalhaṇa: the eight attributes (guṇāḥ) are the eight siddhis: aṇimā (minification), laghimā (lightness), mahimā (physical expansion), garimā (heaviness), prāptiḥ (instant acquisition), prākāmyam (irresistable will), īśitvam (lordliness), vaśitvam (power of influence). Ḍalhaṇa also cites CaŚā 1.140, which has a different list: āveśaś cetaso jñānam arthānāṃ chandataḥ [or ca svataḥ] kriyā | dṛṣṭiḥ śrotraṃ smṛtiḥ kāntir iṣṭataś cāpy adarśanam-ity aṣṭavidham aiśvaryam āhuḥ | (Possession [āveśa] of [another’s] mind, knowledge of objects according to one’s will, and [the powers of] action, vision, hearing, memory, beauty, and invisibility, all gained in accordance with one’s desire, these, they say, are the eight kinds of majesty). Ḍalhaṇa glosses vyastaḥ as dvitricaturaḥ and samastāḥ as sarve, which is to say fewer of the eight siddhis are manifested according to the power of the possessing agent. He concludes that fewer of these attributes are found in asuras, etc., and all in divinities (tatra vyastā guṇā asurādigrahāṇāṃ samastā devagrahāṇām).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ḍalhaṇa confirms that saṃviśanti refers to sexual intercourse (te devayonayo manuṣyaiḥ saha na saṃviśanti). Thus, medical practitioners of the day must have encountered such claims, based, no doubt, on references in the epics and elsewhere to divinities and semidivine beings cohabiting with humans, e.g., Purūravas and Urvaśī. Ḍalhaṇa glosses āviśanti with anupraviśanti. Cf. Weiss 1977:54 for discussion of this verse.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;“Infinite numbers,” koṭisahasrāyutapadmasaṃkhyāḥ: koṭi, ten million; sahasra, one thousand; ayuta, ten thousand; padma, according to Ḍalhaṇa, fourteen times the multiples of the previous numbers.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ḍalhaṇa asks, rhetorically, how a being who shares at least part of the essence of deities can relish blood, fat, and flesh, etc. He answers that Nirṛti is the grandfather of the demons (nirṛtī rakśasāṃ pitāṃahaḥ), who, through their association with the deities, etc., acquired part of their natures.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Aruṇadatta glosses: sadyaḥ adhunātanaḥ pūrvajanmakṛto vā hetuḥ (action performed at the present time or during a previous birth).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;See this chapter, n. 236, for more on the continued use of this term.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The editor of the text cites “Candra” (Candranandana’s Padārthacandrika): śmaśānacatvaracaityādiṣu (burning ground, crossroad, or [Jain or Buddhist] funeral mound).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;parasūtakasaṅkaraḥ, cf. Candra: strīprasavasaṅkāryam; also Meulenbeld HIML IB:563n90, on this difficult term.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The critical text reads kāṣṭhāśvaṃ tathā (who mounts a wooden horse). This makes no contextual sense and at best could be an idiom (found nowhere else, so far as I am aware) for delusional sensory activity. In the absence of certainty with regard to that, however, the translation I offer is of a minority reading: kāṣṭḥāśmarāśim, for which, compare Caraka 6.9.20(8): aśmakāṣṭhādhirohaṇaratiṃ (who enjoys climbing on assorted heaps of garbage and walking on rags).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;tṛṇachidram, lit. “one [who digs] holes in the grass”; Weiss: “who burrows in the grass” (1977: 291). Unfortunately no commentary addresses this compound. I prefer to take it metaphorically: chidra in its known meaning of “imperfection”; tṛṇa as “straw,” “grass,” “insignificant,” “minute,” “worthless.”&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;AṣṭāṅgaSam 7.2 replaces kūṣmāṇḍa with kārkhoda, but includes the kūṣmāṇḍa elsewhere. See Chapter 11, n. 97; this is surely a variant of khakhōrda. For more complete information on the kūṣmāṇḍa see Meulenbeld HIML IB:563n101.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The notes to the text provide several alternative readings: maukiraṇa, uttaruṇā, ramautkiraṇa. None of these help in identification of this enigmatic graha. For other occurrences of this word see Meulenbeld HIML IIB:564n103.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cf. ibid.:564n104, for a discussion of this word. Cf. KSS 73.290 for vetālānupraviṣṭa, and 73.292 for vetālādhiṣṭhita.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Clifford 1984:10.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Weiss 1977:116.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ibid.:183. It may be of interest to note here that what is now regarded as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) was interpreted in Europe as demonic possession and treated with exorcism until the nineteenth century, when clinicians decided that this condition was a disease rather than the devil’s work. Freud recommended psychoanalytic guidance to free such victims from their obsession, which he believed was the result of being torn between guilty fear and defiant rage born of draconian toilet training. One treatment to which OCD has been surprisingly responsive is prefrontal lobotomy (PFL). Since the heyday of this treatment, genetic markers for OCD have been discovered in laboratory animals, and drugs such as Prozac and Zoloft, which are selective serotonin uptake inhibitors, have become cornerstones of treatment, though Pflis still often recommended in extreme cases.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ibid.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ibid. It is important to recognize that Weiss is not the first to attempt such an analysis. His work represents significant advances over that of Sinh Jee, who wrote in 1896: “The demoniacal diseases of the Hindus are but other words for hysteria, epilepsy, dancing mania, and other disorders of the nervous system” (cited by Weiss, 1977:53–54).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Though see Suśruta, Śārīrasthāna 1.18 for a similar, if less-detailed, passage. See also Manu 12.40–51 for a different model of sattvas.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Wujastyk (1998) gives an accessible account of the contents of these texts.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;See also Weiss 1980:105, for a discussion of sattva. He says that Ca 4.4 uses it in the sense of “personality,” but that Ca 4.3 identifies it with manas.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Suddham here is equivalent to sāttvikam, characterized by sattvaguṇa.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Weiss mentions the “insane character” (1977:34) in the Mattavilāsaprahasana, but fails to mention that the character is possessed.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Meulenbeld states: “Weiss tried to correlate [mental disorders according to Āyurveda] with the syndromes of Western psychiatry. In my opinion, the results of his efforts are not convincing” (1997:197). However, I also agree with Meulenbeld’s more nuanced sentiment on Weiss’s work: “I would misrepresent the basic assumptions and views of M. Weiss if I were to attribute to him a simple scheme of one-to-one equivalents of Indian and Western diagnostic entities. He explicitly rejects this in theory, but, nevertheless, he often suggests it” (ibid.:192).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Murphy 1976:1027; cf. Weiss 1977:5.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Clifford 1984:xiii, 12.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;This was the same decade that Obeyesekere published his initial studies and that Kakar (1978), Goldman (1978), Masson (1974, 1976), and others initially applied Freudian psychodynamics to Indian cultural and literary history. These studies stand out today as period pieces. Kripal 1995, discussed in Chapter 2, is much more substantive and sophisticated, though, as I pointed out there, not beyond criticism.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;On Candranandana and his works, see Meulenbeld, HIML IA:665f. and notes; IIA:120ff. and notes.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;See Fenner, who asserts: “All Tibetan writers have accepted the tradition that the rGyud bzhi is a translation of a Sanskrit medical book titled Amṛtahṛdayāṣṭāṅgaguhyopadeśa Tantra” (1996:458). This text needs to be found and checked, as there is much in Fenner’s article that is questionable. It is not mentioned at all by Meulenbeld in HIML. For a good discussion contextualizing the Gyu-zhi, see Obermiller 1989.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;For an outline of the entire text, see Clifford 1984:237–241.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ibid.:148.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ibid.:149.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ibid.:151–152. Also: “‘Ghosts’ and ‘evil spirits’ are not regarded simply as the projections of an unhealthy mind. For although they arose from projections, they are said to be real in a relative sense. That is, they have to be dealt with” (p. 159). Along the same lines, she states: “Two predominant themes emerge in the Dharma view of ‘demons.’ One, from the level of absolute truth, they do not exist. Like everything else, they have no self-nature. Two, from the level of relative truth, they have conditioned existence. One should protect oneself from their negative influence” (p. 161).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ibid.:214. Heinroth’s most famous work was Störungen des Seelenlebens (Disorders of the Soul, 1818). Heinroth was the first to use the term “psychosomatic” to describe the connection between the psyche and the body.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Clifford 1984:219.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ibid. On the relationship between emotional and humoral imbalance, see Meulenbeld 1997:208–209.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Indeed, Clifford repeatedly defends Buddhist positionings. I look forward to a more perspicacious approach to cross-cultural, particularly Buddhist, psychology. Clifford’s effort may be compared to Vogt 1999, discussed in Chapter 4, in that the point of reference for both is abhidharma and that neither inspires confidence in their psychoanalytic expertise. In this sense, Weiss’s study is more reliable. As mentioned earlier (see Chapter 2), a more productive cross-cultural methodological exercise is Littlewood 1996.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Clifford 1984:167.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Vogt 1999:48.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Clifford 1984:154.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ibid.:155.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ibid.:176–177.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ibid.:18o.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ibid.:177.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ibid.:180.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ibid.:177.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ibid.:180.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ibid.:184–195.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ibid.:195–197.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ibid.:195.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Nevertheless, her study would have been greatly enhanced if she had utilized Weiss’s work, which was completed several years before the publication of her book, or if she had used the published and translated āyurvedic texts as a check on her textual history.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;For example, Lutz 1988; Lynch 1990. Recall Lutz’s argument that emotion is an “ideological practice.”&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;On this, and much more about the sources and variation of emotion, see the comprehensive study of Nussbaum, 2001:151ff., passim.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;This opposes Freud, who argued, at least in Totem and Taboo (1946), for the universal applicability of his system.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Very few studies have been conducted on the origins of any of these classifications. See, however, Mukherjee (1981) for speculations on an early group of five: pitṛ, gandharva, deva, asura, and rakṣas.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;In addition to those mentioned below, some Purāṇas describe a certain class of beings as simply “possessors” (āvesaka); cf. VayuP 2.8.40, ŚivaP 2.2.33.22a, SkandaP 1.2.26.42c.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A brief text that I cannot deal with extensively here (because I did not discover it until the present manuscript was sent off to press) is the Āviṣṭaceṣṭāvidhiparivartaḥ (ĀCVP), “Chapter on Instructions Regarding Behavior of the Possessed,” appearing in the Mahāyānasūtrasaṃgraha, Part 2, pp. 255–259. This text is taken from the Mañjusrimulakalpa (MMK), the exact dating of which is uncertain, but appears to have roots as early as the fourth century C.E., but was probably not fully compiled until the tenth century. This fragment, like the rest of the MMK, is presented as a dialogue between Sākyamuni and Mañjusri Kumārabhūta. The question Mañjusrī poses to Sākyamuni concerns the behavior of people whose bodies have been possessed by other beings, including Buddhist teachers (ārya), divine beings, mendicants, perfected spiritual practitioners, gandharvas, yakṣas, rakṣasas, piśācas, great serpent beings (mahoraga), and so on, whether human or nonhuman, what kinds of physical actions and symptoms of these beings are revealed by these individuals, as well as the different courses of action to be taken in such cases.&#xA;Sākyamuni then delivers a discourse in 59 verses that covers two topics. The first deals with the symptoms of positive possession, describing the symptoms of auspiciousness in a person thus possessed by a deva. The second topic is a linguistic circumnavigation of India, attributing the peculiarities of speech in different parts of the subcontinent to a primal ancestor that could be identified as a yakṣa, mahoraga, kinnara, piśāca, garuḍa, and so on, along with a caricature of the speech of these regions, in phonological detail. Thus, this text should be of interest to scholars who study the dialectology of first millennium C.E. South Asia. Also of interest is the fact that the word most commonly employed in the ACVP for possession is avatāra (“descent,” which we have discussed above in reference to bhakti texts), though the words āveśa and āviṣṭa also appear in the text. It appears then, that the ACVP employs demonology as a sociolinguistic trope, rendering it qualitatively different from its use in the āyurvedic and tantric literature.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;For the full story of the discovery of the manuscripts and an accounting of the contents, see Wujastyk 1998:195ff.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Hoernle 1909:2:223, 227; plate 49, part 6, leaf i, Reverse. Compare this to a sixth-century manuscript fragment from Bāmiyān; cf. Ojihara 1984:308.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Perhaps this is identical to Vinatā, the śakunigrahaḥ, from the MBh (3.219.26) noted earlier.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cf. MBh 3.269.2, in which Pūtana is an enemy of Rama. But this is probably the same as the Pūtanā-graha (despite the short “a” at the end of the word) from MBh 3.219.26–27.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cf. AVŚ 8.6.21, chyaka; this hymn is meant for the protection of pregnant women and therefore precedes the notion of bālagraha in the MBh and the medical literature. This hymn contains a large number of difficult words; cf. Whitney 1905 II:493ff. Hoernle suggests “unnatural change in appearance” (1909:2:227n5) after Caraka 5.7, Susruta 1.31: “morbid appearance” (ibid.:172n383). On chāyā-graha, see Jamison 1991:142ff.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Hoernle regards this problematic word as most likely an orthographic error for dustāraka (difficult to cross over), hence “evil eye” (1909:2:227n6). However, this word appears in the ACVP unambiguously as the name of a possessor.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It is not possible that in this context maruta indicates either the vedic deities known as the Maruts, or Hanumān, even as a possessing entity, one of whose names more than a millennium later was Mārutī; cf. Chapter 11, on possession of Hanumān.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cf. Manu 12.71cd, amedhyakuṇapāśī ca kṣatriyaḥ kaṭapūtanaḥ (a kaṭapūtana is a kṣatriya [spirit] that eats impure objects and corpses). Kullūka glosses amedhyakuṇapāśī as purīṣaśavabhojī (an excrement and corpse eater). Manu 12.71–72 contains equally horrific fates for members of other varṇas who neglect their ordained duties, but for some reason kṣatriyas alone were singled out here.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;This term is still widely used in Kerala; cf. Caldwell 1999:213.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;There is a class of tantric texts, now mostly lost, called bhūtatantras. One of them, the Totula, is quoted by Kṣemarāja in his commentary on Netra Tantra 19.70.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;This division (or variants of it) is often found in tantric texts. See, e.g., NT 19.30c–31: balikāmas tathā cānye bhoktukāmās tathāpare || ratikāmā hantukāmā vātajāḥ pittajāḥ pare | śleṣmajāḥ saṃnipātotthā bhūtā vividharūpakāḥ || (Various species of bhūta, fond of sacrifice, of eating, of sex, and of killing, are produced from disorders of wind, bile, phlegm, and all three together [saṃnipātajāḥ], respectively). The commentary on NT glosses bhoktukāmāḥ as māṃsaraktābhilāṣiṇaḥ (desirous of meat and blood).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Verse 1 reads heḍhra. I am not able to locate this word elsewhere in Sanskrit or Prakrit. I am grateful to Robert Zydenbos for the following: “It could be a Sanskritised Dravidian word. Kannada has a word heḍḍa, ‘a dull, stupid man, a fool’ [Kittel 1968–71:4:1755], with derived words like heḍḍatana / heḍḍu ‘stupidity, foolishness,’ and heḍḍāṭa, ‘stupid, foolish behaviour’” (e-mail communication, February 16, 2003). It appears, then, that we can be fairly certain that heḍhra was Sanskritized from this or a related South Dravidian word. See Prasnamārga, an astrological text in Sanskrit from Kerala (dealt with below), for the word hedva (15.62c), with probably the same meaning. The description could be that of spasticity or another kind of muscular or motor disorder, or, just as likely, severe mental retardation.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;sutkāravān (makes the sound sūt). This could also refer to whistling.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Dwyer reports: “As many Hindus often comment, ‘Women have a weak heart; so spirits severely attack them’” (aurato ke kamzor dil hotā hai; islīe bhūt-pret us par jyādā hamlā karte hai)” (2003:45).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Kane (HDh I.2:800 ff.) dates it to 1360–1390.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The other important work is the Vīrasiṃhāvaloka; see below, n. 248.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;For a more extended explanation of the principles of this literature, see Nambiyar’s introduction to the Sanskrit text of the Madanamahārṇava, pp. 15ff.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Nambiyar, in his introduction to the MM, writes: “Most of the causes are more or less connected with immorality and violation of the social customs and manners” (p. 25). For an account of karmavipāka in more canonical dharmasāstra texts, see Rocher 1980.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;On the problems of violence and killing in the ritual arena, see Knipe 2004: “goats and humans have identical structures and therefore goats are the best offerings to the gods. No goat is ever ‘killed,’ that is, annihilated. Rather, it is transformed by ritual speech and practice” (p. 438). See also Houben 1999; Tull 1996.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cf. Taittirīya Āraṇyaka II.7. This is performed before most śrauta rituals, rites of passage (saṃskāra), and other complicated brahmanical ceremonies.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cf. Kane HDh IV:134ff.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ashok Aklujkar has suggested to me that the reading apastamba could be wrong, that it could be avaṣṭhambha, which can have the meaning “arrogant” or “resolute.” However, the text does not record a pāṭhabheda here, nor do the orthographic possibilities support such a reading.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Probably he was a Ṛgvedin, as he quotes the entire sūkta, ṚV 6.24 in his comments on the karṇagraha. This sort of block quotation is unusual in Sanskritic commentarial tradition.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The discussion on the navagraha, probably a “new” or “recent spirit” rather than one of the nine planets, refers explicitly to a sexually transmitted disease. This spirit afflicts a man who has had sex with the wife of a friend, an ascetic, a guru, of a master. He is afflicted with a burning penis (meḍhradāhī), among other things.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;This is the view of Kātyāyana, cited by the MM. Viśveśvara Bhaṭṭa comments that the rice and ghee can be offered separately.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cf. Śāṇkhāyana ŚSū 9.9.5 (cf. Āśvālāyana ŚSū 8.6.13 for a slightly different application). That Viśveśvara Bhaṭṭa would know the ritual applications for this also suggests that he is a Ṛgvedin.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The Vidhānamālā (Garland of Ritual), a text probably dating to the nineteenth century, deals with this topic in much more abbreviated and bloodless fashion. Cf., e.g., VM, p. 26, for an account of the karṇagrahapīḍāśamana-vidhānam (ritual that allays affliction by a karṇagraha), p. 27, for the skandagrahapīḍāśamana-vidhānam (ritual that allays affliction by a skandagraha), and p. 28, for the skandāpasmārapīḍāśamana-vidhānam (ritual that allays affliction by a skadāpasmāragraha), and other childhood and planetary grahas.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Thanks to Ashok Aklujkar for this suggestion.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Shukla 1980:170f. For a lively but fragmentary account of a local North Indian demonology, see Kakar 1982:20-31.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Shukla 1980:170f. Also see Parry 1994:230f. for discussion of some of the same material. Note Parry’s statement, which we have countered often here, “that spirit possession is really an oblique aggressive strategy by which the weak and the exploited get back at those who oppress them” (p. 231). An example of a more recent “orientalist” missionary who dealt with this is McClintock (1990), dealt with in Chapter 2. His detailed account of bhūtavidyā draws largely from others’ ethnographies, rather than from his own work in Pakistan in the 1980s. Thus, his account does not situate the material in a specific local tradition or geographic area. He lists five categories of bhūta among Muslims in India (and presumably Pakistan): (1) jinn (a class of beings between angels and men); (2) pari (fairy of entrancing beauty); (3) shayatin or shaitan (devils, demon hosts, fallen angels); (4) ifrit (a powerful and malignant genius, the ghosts of the wicked are sometimes so termed) (5) marid (an evil genius of the most powerful kind) (pp. 39–40). McClintock’s Christian evangelism biases his description and views of other people’s beliefs and practices; it is thus comparatively unhelpful. Although his outlook is more generous than that of Ziegenbalg in the early eighteenth century, he still does not understand academic ethnography. His main source is Crooke 1894. It is valuable that he brought together Crooke’s data in a single organized list; yet to him it serves no purpose other than to vouchsafe the indigenous people’s need for a liberating nonsuperstitious Christianity.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Pollock 1991:81.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;This word is uncertain, possibly from būṛnā. Shukla’s transliteration is random, at best.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Another problematic word, possibly marua.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The word ḍīh refers to a mound on which its shrine is situated. I am grateful to Philip Lutgendorf for assisting me with these Hindi terms and their significance. For another extensive catalogue of local bhūtas and a discussion of their relations with disease, see Prabhu 1977.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Maloney 1980:245.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Maloney suggests, rather, that this is from “Buddha,” but I question this.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I have doubts about this etymology.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;For these descriptions, see ibid.:242–246.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ibid.:254.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Such numbers occur in Tantras as well. For example, see NT 19.62cd-63: “I made thirty trillion (triṃśatkoṭī sahasrāṇām) fearsome Vināyakas with the brightness of blazing fires from my thumb. If someone is impeded by them he will be overcome.” Cf. McHugh 2000.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The idea of hordes, gaṇas, acting for good and ill is a persistent and powerful idea, dating from the earliest vedic texts to the adālat of Bālājī described in Chapter 4.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;For the cakrapūja and tantric sexual ritual, see Bharati 1965:228ff.; Marglin 1985:227f., White 2003.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Rāmāyaṇa 3.36.20ab: krīḍāratividhijñānāṃ samājotsavaśālinām; cf. Pollock 1991:79, 163.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ibid.:79n170.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ibid.:83–84.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;In the NP, however, this ritual of apparent fertility appears, rather oddly, in the fall, perhaps as a final opportunity for revelry before the Kashmiri winter sets in.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;See the translations earlier of Ca 6.9.20.8, Su 6.60.15, AH 6.4.30–34b, ĪŚP 42.22ab.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;See the Kāśīkhaṇḍa of the Skanda Purāṇa (uttarārdha, ch. 54) and trans. Tagare (1997:28–35). See also the Pisācamocanamāhātmyam, published in 1910, which contains an introduction in Hindi describing the Pisācmocan tīrtha and its importance, the SkP chapter, the Śrīkapardīśa Stotra, and instructions for the ancestral rites to be performed at the temple tank (piśācamocane tripiṇdīśrāddhavidhiḥ). See Parry 1994:242ff. for an ethnography of an exorcism at Pisācmocan.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Daniel Cohen reports a phenomenon known as pretpañcayat, modeled after the local village governing body called pañcāyat (cf. Chapter 4, on the venue for exorcism at Bālājī modeled on another judicial paradigm, the adālat). The pretpañcayat features competition between exorcists, usually in family disputes, brother against brother. Cohen observes that the primary locus of exorcism in Varanasi is the exorcist, not any temple or specific place, including Pisācmocan. What this means in practice is that exorcisms are generally performed in the home of the client or the “office” of the exorcist, not usually in a public arena like a temple. I am grateful to Cohen for sharing with me his research and insights on the Pisācmocan temple.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;This term is used by Dārila, in his commentary on Kausikasutra 25.22; cf. Bahulkar 1994:90.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Wujastyk 1998:212–235; cf. also Kāśyapa Saṃhitā, pp. 351–374.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;For a fairly comprehensive discussion of bālagrahas in the major āyurvedic texts and the Agnipurāṇa, see Kumar 1994:284–312. See especially p. 287, table 42, which compares the names of the bālagrahas in different texts (though without explanation). Kumar does not theorize about balagrahas, except to enter into highly suspicious speculations on the diseases wrought by them. For example, affliction by Revatī (“Lady Opulence,” in Wujastyk’s felicitous translation) results in diarrhea, dehydration, anemia, and vitamin B deficiency; Mukhamaṇḍikā afflicts with “Indian Childhood Cirrhosis,” etc. (p. 304).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Also bhūtābhiṣaṅga (intimate contact with a bhūta) (Su 6.39.60; Ca 6.3.116; Bhāvaprakāsa 8.1); and bhutopasarga (touched by a bhūta) (BhP 4.29.23). The Śabdakalpadruma cites under āveśaḥ (1:194): bhūtādinā rogaḥ; bhūtasaṃcāraḥ, grahādayaḥ (Rājanighaṇṭu); āsaktiḥ, abhiniveśaḥ (Raghuvaṃśa 5.19).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;tasyās tu dharma eva nivṛttikāraṇam uktam iti | KS kalpasthānam 6(?).3.7 (Kāśyapa Saṃhitā, p. 352).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;To take one further example from the later āyurvedic tradition as a case in point, see Aḍhamalla’s Dīpikā on the varieties of bālagraha presented in the thirteenth-century Śārṇgdhara Saṃhitā. Aḍhamalla states that “seizers [graha] beginning with skandas possess children” (skandagrahādayo bāleṣv āviśanti). Thus, by the time of Śārṅgdhara, followed by Aḍhamalla in the fifteenth century, graha was defined in terms of āveśa (rather than the more expected praveśa). Śārṅgadhara lists twelve varieties of bālagraha: tathā bālagrahāḥ khyātā dvādaśaiva munīśvaraiḥ | skandagrāho viśākhaḥ syāt svagrahaś ca pitṛgrahaḥ | naigameyagrahas tadvac chakuniḥ śītapūtanā | mukhamaṇḍitikā tadvat pūtanā cāndapūtanā || revatī caiva saṃkhyātā tathā syāc chuṣkarevatī | (1.7.189–191b).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;On Khaḍgarāvaṇa and the lost Khaḍgarāvaṇabālacikitsā, see Goudriaan 1977. On Khaḍgarāvaṇa as a form of Śiva, also called Caṇḍeśvara, Rudra, and Caṇḍāsidhārāpati (Lord of the Edge of the Fierce Sword), see Bühnemann 1999:325. On the importance of Rāvaṇa in this context, see Zysk (1985:67) for discussion of the Rāvaṇaproktabālācikitsāsūtra, a pediatrics text; also Filliozat (1937:159–178), on the Buddhist transformation of Rāvaṇa into a peaceful king with healing powers. Filliozat’s volume is an expansion of his earlier article (1935). The Kumāratantra draws heavily from the MBh, AV, Caraka, and Suśruta, all of which Filliozat discusses in detail. The Nārāyaṇīya mentioned here is undoubtedly the Tantrasārasaṃgraha, known in Kerala as the Viṣanārāyanīya. For this text, see below.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The text prescribes the manner in which the mantras are to be recited. The terms tārapūrvaṃ namo ’ntam and praṇavādinamo ’ntam (beginning with o and ending with namaḥ) or svāhāntaḥ (ending with svāha) often indicate the recitation of a full mantra or series of mantras. This is irrespective of whether the mantra actually ends with namaḥ or svāhā. Tāra is equivalent to praṇava while ṭhaṭha indicates svāhā.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cf. ĪŚP 41, p. 288.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;On Rajasthan (and rural UP), see the video Kusum (see Chapter 4, n. 17). The healer, who was not an āyurvedic physician, gave the father of the possessed girl (Kusum) a handful of packets of an undisclosed substance with instructions to burn them regularly in front of the girl.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I am grateful to Vaidyamadham Cheriya Narayanan Nambudiri for this information.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;On aṣṭavaidya physicians, see Zimmermann 1987:212–213, and below.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;This sort of “hot” substance is a tantric innovation; it is not commonly offered to Śiva, generally considered a “cool” or ascetic deity.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;For this reason neem twigs have long been a common form of toothbrush in India and are still widely used in the countryside.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;In modern-day India, sprouts of various kinds are germinated on a small raised plot of ground inside the house as part of the ritual of the nine-day festival to the goddess (Durgāpūjā) in the month of Asvina (September–October). It is likely that this is a very old practice.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cf. Meulenbeld HIML IB:237n6. Meulenbeld does not suggest a botanical name or identification for this plant.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;For closer examinations of the KausSu on this, see Bahulkar 1994:109–110, Bloomfield 1897:263–264, and Zysk 1985:29–31.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Chapters 11–16 deal with bālagrahas and unmāda. This text is in print and can thus be compared to the account in the ĪŚP also see Meulenbeld HIML IIA:456–457, IIB:468–469.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Mother of the dark graha Rāhu, daughter of Dakṣa or Kaśyapa and wife of Kaśyapa or Vipracitti; cf. MBh 1.59.12,30.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;This bija is exclaimed at the funeral pyre when the skull cracks and the jīva exits the body.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Many of the words here (e.g., mañja, kaḍhḍha, and ṭhaṭha) are incomprehensible and would be accepted for their mantric value alone were it not for the fact that this mantra reads rather differently, and more comprehensibly, in the text of the Nārāyaṇīya, viz. the Tantrasārasaṃgraha (pp. 158–60), demonstrating that the ĪŚP had either corrupted it or was itself in possession of a corrupt version. The mantra in the Nārāyaṇīya reads: oṃ namaḥ sarvamātṝṇāṃ hṛdayaṃ moṭaya bhañja paṭa sphoṭaya sphura gṛhṇa ākaṭu troṭaya | evaṃ siddhiṃ jñāpayati | hara nirdoṣaṃ kuru bālakaṃ bālo vā sarvagrāhīṇām upakramyatu | (Om, salutations to the heart of all the Little Mothers. Crush! Break! Rip! Flash! Spring forth! Possess! ākaṭu [You whose pungent odor comes forth(?)]. Break apart! One should announce this clearly. O Hara, make this child faultless or let the child approach all the possessing demonesses!) (The commentator advises doubling the impv. 2 sg. forms, e.g., moṭaya moṭaya, bhañja bhañja, consistent with what we have seen in the South Indian manuscripts examined in Chapter 11.) The text continues: oṃ cāmuṇḍe namo divye hraṃ hrīṃ apasarantu duṣṭagrahāḥ | hrūṃ tathā gacchantu guhyakāḥ | anyatra sthāne oṃ rudro jñāpayati ṭha ṭha | One of the striking features of these mantras is the extensive use of retroflex consonants, e.g., kaṭa, ṭhaṭha, troṭaya. This could be due to a brahmanical assignation of these mantras to lower-class, non-Sanskritic strata of society, in this case an assumption or recognition of Dravidian or tribal origins, as these languages have much more retroflexion than Sanskrit. For somewhat similar speculations regarding the secret speech of Himalayan tantras, see Davidson 2002:267ff.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cf. the discussions in Chapter 4 of the work of Srinivas, Mumford, Pakaslahti, Dwyer, and Vogt, which provide very different models of healing processes associated with possession.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;For a review of scholarship on the term yukti see Engler 2003:426, 428. Engler describes it as “empirically based inference,” drawing principally on CaSū 11.21–25 and arguing against its modern interpretation as scientific reasoning.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;See F. Smith 1987 for an idea of how the vedic sacrificial rituals varied within traditions defined by affiliation with a single Śrautasūtra, such as Apastamba or Baudhāyana.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The eight powers (guṇāḥ) are probably the eight archetypal siddhis; see note 85.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;SuUt 60.21cd: ye tv āviśantīti vadanti mohāt te bhūtavidyāviṣayād apohyāḥ|| Though Caraka says that grahas are innumerable (Ca 6.9.21.8, above, p. 490; also Su 6.60.22, above p. 492), he does not attribute the possession to lesser spirits in a hierarchy of fiends.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;See Stephens for accounts of sex with demons as an “aspect of the more general European fixation on physical interaction with demons” (2003:14). Agreements were contractual, including the sale of one’s soul to the devil. This idea does not appear to have resonance in India, where such sexuality is more prominently formalized and medicalized. Nor did this lead to crises of belief among the Hindu clergy, as appears to have been the case among Christian clergy in Europe.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;This is not so far-fetched as it may seem at first glance. See Slater 2003 on the work of the psychologist David Barlow of the Center for Anxiety and Related Disorders at Boston University. Slater writes:&#xA;Barlow’s method for treating anxiety disorders is surprisingly simple, although its philosophical and clinical implications are anything but. He aims to reduce anxiety not by teaching customary relaxation techniques involving calming mantras or soothing imagery, but by doing just the opposite: forcing the patient to repeatedly face his most dreaded situation, so that, eventually, he becomes accustomed to the sensation of terror. Barlow claims he can rid some people of their symptoms in as little as five to eight days. His treatment promises to be psychotherapy’s ultimate fast track, but while many clinicians praise its well-documented results, others take a dimmer view of what one clinician calls “torture, plain and simple.” (p. 34)&#xA;There can be little doubt that the extreme forms of psychological treatment recommended by Caraka et al. were as controversial in their day as Barlow’s are today, testifying, at the very least, to the composite nature of the āyurvedic compendia.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;CaCi 6.9. 31cd: vismṛter hetor nayanti prakṛtiṃ manaḥ; cf. also 6.9.79–98.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;On daivavyapāsrayacikitsā, see, in addition to the above, AHCi 1.171, 5.83–84; ASaṃSū 9.76; cp. Hārīta 3.3.2–3. Rasaratnasamuccaya 22.60–69; Chattopadhyaya 1979:314–320.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It is also possible that this term referred to internal practices, such as yoga, which do not require priestly or other formal mediation. Neither Caraka nor Susruta mentions yogic or Buddhist practices, to which sattvāvajaya might refer. Such practices might have been expunged from these texts in an attempt to enhance their scientific credibility. Their empiricism would have admitted observable or inferred phenomena, which to them included at least some ritual, use of gemstones, etc. By the same token, possession was admitted as a valid category, legitimated by repetition of characteristic behavior. For the same reason, sattvāvajaya, which must have been an inherited category with which they were uncomfortable, was relegated to the scantiest offhand mention. On the word sattvāvajaya, see references in note 2.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Oracular possession also may be characterized as a vāta disorder. Knipe observes that most goddess ritualists in coastal Andhra Pradesh are “by nature excitable, sometimes volatile and raucous, their monologues punctuated with belches, yawns, hiccups and other marks of incipient possession” (2004:440). All of these are characteristics of vātaprakopa (affliction due to vāta imbalance).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;dṛṣṭaṃ spṛṣṭam athāghrātaṃ tad dhi sarvagrahāpaham; CaCi 6.9.62cd.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I am grateful to Robert Svoboda for this information (e-mail communication, March 4, 2003).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;See the comments of Raman 1991:1:383. He states, on PrMā 12.62, that the proportion of dung, urine, milk, and yogurt should be 1:2:16:5. Raman does not note the proportion of ghee, but presumably the mixture should consist predominantly of ghee, the quantity of which might remain unspecified. Raman does not state his source. Vaidyamadham says that the ghee should measure four times the quantity of yogurt.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cf. CaCi 6.9.50–52, for dog’s bile (śunaḥ pittam), beak and feather, probably incinerated, from inauspicious birds including the owl, vulture, and crow. These were likely recommended for their native properties that could contribute to an atmosphere inimical to bhūtas.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Recall that the mixing of animal with vegetal substances goes back to vedic times. Note in particular that surā, a kind of multigrain wine, produced for the Sautrāmaṇī sacrifice, is mixed with milk and the hair of a lion, wolf, and tiger (cf. Kane HDh II.2:1224–26). The Śatapatha Br. 12.7.3.19–21 (Eggeling 1900:229–230) demonstrates that the mythic idea is to include potent elements of wildness (raudra), because this is for Rudra. A similar notion of integrating different aspects of nature is presented here, the purpose of which is to present a multilevel front against offending bhūtas or grahas.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;For recipes from the Tibetan Gyu-zhi, see Clifford 1984:88.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;For a summary of the text, see Meulenbeld HIML IIA:86–90 and notes.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;For dāruharidrā, elsewhere called dārunisā, see Meulenbeld HIML IIB:305n900, given as Berberis aristata DC. Like the barberry in Europe and the Oregon grape in North America, it is more a bush than an actual tree and possesses at least some of the medicinal properties of turmeric (haridra). The reason for preparing this under puṣya nakṣatra is not stated, but possibly the name puṣya itself, “prosperity,” is sufficient.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Vacā (Acorus calamus Linn.) is a widely used root that is dried and chewed to alleviate the discomforts of a sore throat. As mentioned earlier, it is also recommended for the enhancement of mental clarity. It is “hot” in the sense that it induces the release of heat in the body.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;According to two of my āyurvedic informants, this is included because the cat has the capacity to recognize a bhūta, and the dried and ground up excrement captures that quality. Whether this kind of associative thinking was also that of the authors of the classical texts is uncertain.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The text says kesa (hair). However, according to my āyurvedic informants, this means jaṭāmāṃsī, a cooling and sweet root that is easily acquired and is often used in havan (tantrically inspired fire ritual). The word jaṭā means “dreadlock,” specifically those of sādhus, grown in the image of Śiva. Thus, jaṭāmāṃsī may be viewed as a kind of keśa.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Priya Vrat Sharma, the editor and translator of the published text of the Cakradatta, translates pakvaindrī, as “ripe fruits of indravāruṇī mixed with cow-urine and ghee,” following the commentary (pakvaindrīphalamūlajam sājyam).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;In fact, mayurapiccha does contain trace elements of copper and gold, which was apparently known by classical practitioners of tantric medicine. Baidyanath, the well-known Indian pharmaceutical firm, manufactures an antispasmodic under the trade name Mayuracandrikā Bhasma, in which the central ingredient is mayurapiccha. The indications on the container state: “Antiemetic. Relieves hiccough, asthma, and vomiting.” All of these are vāta conditions. Similarly, sarpanirmoka (snake skin) is recommended today as an ingredient in a dhūpa meant for alleviating piles—another vāta affliction.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Some vaidyas have altered their views, however, under the influence of Western scientific and psychological theory. Dr. Raghavan Thirumulpad of Chalakudy (Thrissur District), the most prolific modern author of āyurvedic texts in Malayalam, explained to me that bhūtonmāda is always the result of one’s mistaken or non-dharmic actions, prajñāparādha, a word taken from the āyurvedic texts (cf. above AH 6.4.4), which I have often heard vaidyas (and many others, including a variety of vedāntins) use as a descriptor for moral transgression. In his view, bhutonmāda is comparatively rare today, because of changes in contemporary belief systems. This, he says, is an artifact of outdated cultural notions. This view expresses the voice of modern, Western-influenced Sanskritic culture. On his diagnostic approach to bhutonmāda, he said: udāharaṇamātraṃ tu budhimatāṃ, yadoktānusāram evāśrayo maṇḍabudhīnām (An intelligent physician is free to design a clinical approach to each problem, irrespective of the texts, but a slow-witted one strictly adheres to the letter of the texts). This has apparently been the practical approach of Āyurveda for millennia.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Shadows of this might have once been found in Buddhism, where Āryaśūra, in his Jātakamālā, refers to experts in bhūtavidyā as Siddhavidyās; cf. White 1996:58.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;For an account of the possession at the Chottanikkara “Bhagavathy” temple near Tripunithura in the eastern suburbs of Cochin/Ernakulam, see F. Smith 2004.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The institution founded by P. S. Varier, the Arya Vaidya Sala, maintains its home base in Kottakkal, but has dispensaries and pharmaceutical outlets throughout India. According to one of my informants familiar with the Arya Vaidya Sala educational system, this institution has trained more than four hundred non-Hindu vaidyas, most of them Muslims. I have also encountered a number of non-Brahman and Christian vaidyas trained at the aṣṭavaidya medical colleges. The education in the latter institutions is still conducted by Nambudiris, some of whom know the entire AH by heart. I have met a few non-Brahman Hindu pandits in the Varier tradition who have also memorized the entire AH. I mention this to counter the common assertion that only Brahmans study Sanskrit and only Hindus study Āyurveda. In both Kerala traditions, however, I found the non-Hindu vaidyas considerably less skilled because they did not have access to the Sanskrit texts.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A measure of his prestige is that he also bears the title sālāvaidyam. This title indicates that he has the unique eligibility (adhikāra) to sit in a vedic sacrificial arena (yāgasāla) during the performance of a soma sacrifice. In Kerala a doctor is required in a sacrifice, and only a sālāvaidyam is qualified. Vaidyamadham is a follower of the Dakṣiṇāmūrti temple at Shukapuram in Mallapuram District. Historically, he says only members of his family have served as sālāvaidya. Frits Staal does not mention this position in Agni, his massive 1983 study of a vedic agnicayana performed in central Kerala in 1975. Thus, it is doubtful that this tradition is or has been in general currency throughout Kerala. In order to confirm his eligibility for the position of sālāvaidyam, at one time he had to spend forty-one days at this temple “doing dhyāna and bhajan,” meditating and singing hymns to the deity. In addition, he says, yajñikas or sacrificial patrons (āhitāgnis) assemble at this Dakṣiṇāmūrti temple to practice for their sacrifices, as Dakṣiṇāmūrti is “the deity for right thinking.”&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The botanical identity of this herb is disputed, as several plants have been identified with this name. One possibility is Convolvulus pluricaulis. Another is Canscora decussata, reportedly used for śaṅkhapuṣpi in Bengal and parts of north India. A third is Clitoria ternatea, reportedly used for śaṅkhapuṣpi in Kerala. In any case, śaṅkhapuṣpi is said to increase sattva (brightness, mental clarity, positive qualities) and was prescribed for use in brāhmighṛta and other tonics for the nervous system. (I am grateful to Robert Svoboda for this information.) For similar information, see AH Uttarasthana 1.43, 6.24–25, 7.24, 39.44–51. It has also been called viṣṇukrānta, probably denoting that parts of the plant were used in Hindu worship. See &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.thehimalayadrugco.com/herbfinder/h_evolvulus.htm;&#34;&gt;www.thehimalayadrugco.com/herbfinder/h_evolvulus.htm;&lt;/a&gt; for the results of research on it, see &lt;a href=&#34;http://ccras.org/publication/clinical&amp;amp;experimental_1.htm&#34;&gt;http://ccras.org/publication/clinical&amp;amp;experimental_1.htm&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;This is the family of P. Nilakanthan Nambudiri, with whom I also spoke at length. Their burgeoning practice is limited to the treatment of mental disorders. A large majority of their clients are Muslim girls, as Mallapuram District, listed in the 1991 census of India at 68 percent Muslim, now probably has an even higher proportion (this information is missing in the 2001 census). The family of Nilakanthan has a residential facility and empowers their medicines with mantras and puja, all of which are tightly guarded family secrets. For a more complete description of the Poomkutil treatment center, see Unnikrishnan 1998.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;For more on this bhūta, see Tarabout 2003.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cf. Inden 1992.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;For all of this, see the rather hurried and unreliable edition and translation by Raman (1991). It is to a great extent this systematic elegance (or elegant systematics) that makes astrology (jyotiṣa) so attractive in India to this day.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;See Brahmānand Tripāṭhī’s note on this in his Hindi commentary on the AH titled Nirmalā: āyurved kā jyotiṣaśāstra se ghaniṣṭh sambandh hai (Ayurveda’s relationship with the sastra of astrology is of the closest kind).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Trans. Keith 1914:118.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The connection between astrology, tantric ritual, and Āyurveda is found elsewhere in India; it is not limited to Kerala. Another text that is much more expansive on this than the PrMā is the Vīrasiṃhāvaloka, composed in North India, possibly in Gwalior, dated 1383 (see Meulenbeld HIML IIA:229–230 and notes). This text, never the subject of serious academic study, deserves far more attention than I can give it here. It purports to be a jyotiśśāstrakarmavipākāyurvedaprayoga, a term that appears in the colophon to each of its seventy-one chapters. It is a handbook discussing the astrology (jyotiḥ) and karmic causes of disease (karmavipāka, see the above discussion on the Madanamahārṇava), and at length describes medicinal treatments for more than fifty diseases. Curiously, the astrological significations are absent from the account of unmāda, though they are present in the account of apasmāra. The bulk of the section on unmāda consists of recipes for medicated ghees, powders (cūrṇa), and fumigants (dhūpa). It is possible to argue, drawing from Langford’s view of Āyurveda as a cultural commodity in the West today (2002:263ff.), that the four of these taken together—astrology, medicine, ritual, and karmavipāka—have constituted a form of local knowledge and correlative local commodity for more than a thousand years. For more on the situation at present, see Friedman 1986; Perinbanayagam 1982; Pugh 1983.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Clifford 1984:157–158. Kakar reports the following on Tibetans in exile in India: “If the patient is possessed by a bhūta, his eyes move downward toward the left; in the case of possession by a dakini—a female spirit often addressed as ‘Mother,’ who is said to bestow esoteric knowledge and power on its devotees—the eyes move upward toward the right” (1982:110).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cf. Meulenbeld HIML IIA:348–52. This text is widely cited in Maharashtra as an authority on strīroga, (diseases of women), especially regarding questions of childbirth.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;This is from the first few pages of the YR, pp. 12–14 of the Varanasi edition, verses 1–3, 11–20, 22.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The same vaidyas prescribe pearl (muktā) and silver (rajata) bhasmas for nija unmāda.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The nine gems are: Sun–ruby (māṇikya), Moon–pearl (mauktika, muktā), Mars–red coral (pravāla, vidruma), Mercury–emerald (gārutmata, garudodgāra), Jupiter–yellow sapphire (puṣparāga = topaz), Venus–diamond (vajra, hīra, or often simply ratna), Saturn–blue sapphire (indranīla), Rāhu–hessonite or onyx (gomeda), Ketu–cat’s eye (vaiḍūrya). For variations on these gems and how to prepare them, see the sixteenth-century encyclopedia Āyurvedasaukhya 4.649–701. For information on gems in ancient India, see the references cited in Meulenbeld HIML IIB:742–743nn.389–403. Navaratna bhasma is, needless to say, very expensive. It is, however, available.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cf. Meulenbeld HIML IIA:581–787 (Part 10), works on rasaśāstra and ratnaśāstra.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;An edition of this was published in the 1990s in Lhasa. See Byams-pa ’Phrinlas and Wang Lei n.d.:32, thangka 63 and description, pp. 402–405, and thangkas 66–68, pp. 33–34, descriptions, pp. 430–443. This extraordinary text deserves much closer work than that volume gives it.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;One of these is reproduced schematically in Clifford 1984:158; two are reproduced in Tsarong et al. 2001:116.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Clifford 1984:159.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Tsarong et al. 2001:118.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;While virtually all āyurvedic compendia of the past few centuries have an obligatory section on bhūtavidyā, this was not always the case in the first millennium. For example, the Siddhasāra of Ravigupta (from Kashmir, c. 650 C.E.) does not. See Siddhasāra:2:307–313, ch. 20, on unmāda, Āveśa is not mentioned. Ch. 29, called kumāratantra, is somewhat more relevant in its concern with pharmacopeia. The Siddhasāra was translated into Tibetan, Uighur, and Khotanese (at least). This text includes Ronald Emmerick’s edition of the Sanskrit and Tibetan versions.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;However, see White 2003:35ff., and above Ch. 6 note 52.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;See Reddy 2000 and Langford 2002 for illuminating theoretical accounts of the modernization of Āyurveda.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;</description>

      <title>11 Reflections on “Folk” and “Classical” in South Asia</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;From the foregoing discussion of lexemes and terms in many South Asian languages, one conclusion is unavoidable: that with a few notable exceptions the expansion of the lexicon for possession—and, we might cautiously presume, many of the ideologies behind this expansion—was to a great extent derived from Sanskrit and Sanskritic culture, after which it became diversified and adapted into regional languages. Despite this conclusion, the ethnographies highlight the non-brahmanical, non-Sanskritic dimensions of possession and the rejection of clerical authority in favor of a nonmediated transcendence or, at most, a transcendence that is sanctioned—and, therefore, in a sense mediated—by the dynamics of the local culture. Locally construed possession is, furthermore, an irruption of assigned hierarchical place that bears with it a consequent identification with nonhierarchical sacred place—indeed, of the individual as sacred place. Hence, it is an assertion that possession is largely the experiential property (and path) of people of lower social rank, women as well as men. It is regarded, in a critical mass of instances, as a socioreligious innovation of subalterns. Although this may be an overstatement, it is not without basis. After all, the social structure in South Asia hardened into a self-sustaining oppressive force long ago, giving rise to equally self-sustaining forces of reaction that drew form and idiom in part from these forces of oppression. In other words, though the preponderance of the evidence suggests that most possession is an indigenous phenomenon related to brahmanic oppression or “official” brahmanical religion only peripherally,222 in fact, a number of ethnographers (e.g., Sax, Knipe, Claus) have shown that brahmans participate in possession as much as anyone. Thus the “upward” accession of form and idiom is matched by a “downward” accession. As seen below, this is not a recent phenomenon: The evidence adduced from the Sanskrit texts testifies that possession has long been a part of unofficial (and preofficial) brahmanical religion; it was no less a part of Sanskritic culture than was officially engineered brahmanical religion.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>12 NOTES</title>

      <guid>https://vishvAsa.github.io/devaH/meta/AveshaH/articles/self-possessed/2_Modernity_and_the_Languages_of_Possession/4_Notes_on_Regional_Languages_and_Models_of_Possession/12_NOTES/</guid>
      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;This is borne out in a study of the bibliographies in an issue of Puruṣārtha devoted to possession; cf. Assayag and Tarabout 1999. The issue contains thirteen articles (excluding the prologue and epilogue), of which five are on Kerala, two each on Himachal Pradesh and Karnataka (one of these on Tulunad), and one each on Rajasthan, Tamilnadu, Nepal, and Kashmir. The brief article on Kashmir is by André Padoux and is the only one in the collection devoted to possession in the premodern period (cf. Chapter 10).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;These are based on either synonyms or homonyms; see Vogel 1979.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Good examples are Sanskrit dictionaries. For example, Monier-Williams’s English-Sanskrit Dictionary (1851) is of no value because it simply has an English word followed by a large number of Sanskrit words, with no effort to contextualize any of them. By contrast, his Sanskrit-English Dictionary (1899) is much better in that he often (but, by no means, always) cites texts from which he draws a word’s meanings. Better still is the seven-volume Sanskrit-Wörterbuch by Böhtlingk and Roth (1855–75). Best is the Deccan College dictionary (Ghatage et al. 1976–), which, after more than half a century of work, including more than three decades of publishing (as of this writing twenty-six fascicles have been published), is about a third of the way through the first letter of the alphabet. Although the completion schedule has become something of a long-running joke, few scholars doubt the validity of the project or, for the most part, its results. Similarly, the Critical Pali Dictionary (Trenckner et al. 1948–90) begun in the nineteenth century is nowhere near completion. Most dictionaries of regional languages are utterly nonhistorical. To be generous, however, historically sensitive lexicography is definitely on the increase. See, for example, Tulpule and Feldhaus 1999, for Marathi, which tries to recognize chronological changes in meaning.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Sontheimer 1989b:142ff.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Erndl 1996:178.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cf. Korom 1992:275ff.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Caturvedi and Tiwari 1975; cf. bhūtabādhā.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Erndl 1996:178; also Erndl 1993:108. Wadley writes that khelnā “identifies an active and extreme possession which is manifested by the physical activity of the possessed; khelnā is also used to indicate goddess possession in Karimpur” (1976:237n6).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Shukla 1980:167.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Gold 1988:38.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Pfleiderer and Lutze 1979:111.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Freed and Freed 1993:17.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Glucklich 1997:49.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Many of these are found in rural areas, including Bālājī. This contravenes Dumont and Pocock (1959:56–57), who estimated that healers, as distinguished from oracles, are found only in urban settings in India. See Chapter 12 and F. Smith 2004 for notes on the spirit healing center at Chottanikkara in Kerala.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The healing centers at Muslim dargāhs (such as at Badayun, in U.P., south of Bareilfy) and other Sufi-oriented Muslim healing places (such as Matka Pir in Delhi) have clientele that are at least half Hindu.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Dwyer’s ethnographic work (1998, 1999, 2003) was primarily on possession and healing in the main temple of Bālājī, while Pakaslahti has been documenting the work of a healer (bhagat) who conducts his sessions at one of the shrines near the temple. Bālājī has experienced exponential growth in the past twenty-five years, since Kakar was there. Pakaslahti estimates that the better known of the many healers there have hundreds of patients, who are often treated simultaneously. Most of these healers come to Bālājī for regular brief visits from other cities in north India (personal communication); also see Pakaslahti 2005.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Much of the following description is based on my own observations at the shrine that Pakaslahti has studied, augmented by Pakaslahti’s explanations; cf. Pakaslahti 1998:146ff. The tactics of exorcism at Bālājī vary so greatly that it is certain that some of what I observed does not occur at all of its exorcism and healing clinics. Conversely, some of the tactics employed at these other centers are not employed in the adālat that I observed. For a vivid depiction of one healing, see a video for which Pakaslahti was the primary research and scientific advisor: Kusum, by Jouko Aaltonen (Illume Co., 69 minutes; Helsinki, 2000).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Dwyer 1998:7.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The emerging work of Bellamy (2004) at Husain Tekri shows that this image has a broad and varied distribution in northern and western India.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;This is a common genre of popular music in contemporary India.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A Sikh family was also present when I was there and responded similarly.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Dwyer 1999:113.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cf. Obeyesekere 1981; Hiltebeitel 1988, 1991. Dwyer notes: “I was told that the possessed frequently experience a choking sensation (galā bhar ānā), a contraction of the muscles in the throat, and/or a sense of being bound up (bandha); and informants commented that these are the reasons why tight-fitting garments are loosened before, and sometimes during, the ritual, and why a woman’s hair must be untied” (1999:113).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;See Davis 2001:99ff., and the discussion in Chapter 11, for surrogate possession in eighth- to twelfth-century China. Davis’s important study seeks to free possession (pingfu [to lean on and adhere to]) from its “shamanic substrate” and bring it to the center of Chinese religious practice, as the present effort aims to do for India. Davis, to the detriment of his otherwise tight and groundbreaking study, rarely refers to anthropological theory or other situated studies, at least in English. For example, his acceptance of Rouget’s definition of possession as merely “a trance of identification” (ibid.:1, 84) is often inadequate, even for his material. Nevertheless, he does refer to many studies in French and Japanese, lest anyone assume (as Janice Boddy has, apparently) that English is the sole authoritative language for the study of possession. Also important for Chinese religion is Teiser 1988. He makes a case for placing spirit possession within the “shamanic substrate” (to which Davis reacts). He writes that “the shaman is one who has special mastery over shen—spirits from afar, his own spirit, and spirituality in general. The shaman’s special access to shen, then, implies that his mediumship works both ways: he can be possessed by spirits, and he is an adept at soul journeys” (p. 145). In fact, Chinese elites—Buddhist, Confucian, and Daoist—placed these wu (shamanic practitioners) in a substrate. But these are disputes that I am hardly qualified to enter.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;For a somewhat similar situation, see Werbner and Basu 1998:15, where a dargāh is thought of as a Mughal court presided over by a dead saint, potent with charisma, but whose primary minister is a sajjāda. Again, here we have examples of a debate between healer and jinn, where the person’s body is the battleground between the sajjāda and the client.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;One of the Sanskrit manuscripts on possession on which I base my discussion in Chapter 11 below employs the compound kapisainyaprakāra, indicating that one is invoking not only Hanumān but also the army of monkeys (kapisainya) that assisted him in his invasion of Laṇkā. The phauj here is thus evocative not only of the Rāmāyaṇa but of other possession complexes in India.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;For another example of this, in what must be regarded as an extended South Asian religious complex, see Bertrand 2004 on the conversion of “errant” Khmer spirits in Cambodia known as brāy to Buddhist pāramī, spirits who exhibit the Buddhist perfections (Skt. paramā). See also Vogt 1999, discussed below.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;“She” because the assistant in this “clinic” was a sensitive woman named Meena who was herself a former patient who came to this work after a series of traumatic events befell her life leading to a nearly total psychological collapse. See also Trawick 1992:153, for a roughly similar instance, a woman who had experienced possession of Māriamman when she was young who then became a spirit healer only after a near fatal bout of tuberculosis.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Pakaslahti 1998:143. Parry states that in Varanasi, at least, a healer and assistant who work together are recognized by certain specific terms: “The ojhā lures and entraps the ghosts, while the sokhā supervises his efforts and is the real expert in identification” (p. 236, diacritics added). The situation was not quite the same at Bālājī.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;For a similar process of questioning the spirit in more Islamic-centered possession, see Nasir 1987:165f. For a Buddhist context, see Vogt’s findings in Sri Lanka (below).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I am here reminded of a description of an exorcism found in Philostratus’s life of Apollonius of Tyana (Philostratus 1970). Philostratus probably finished writing this text in 220 C.E., while Apollonius, one of the earliest travelers from Greece to India, probably lived in the mid- to late first century C.E. There is no possibility of linking through any recoverable tradition the practice that Apollonius describes with practices in contemporary India. Nevertheless, the passage is of such interest that it is worth quoting in full:&#xA;In the middle of this conversation, the Wise Men were interrupted by the messenger bringing some Indians who needed cures. For instance, he brought forward a woman praying to them on her son’s behalf. He was sixteen years old, she said, but had been possessed for two years by a spirit with a shy, deceitful character. One of the wise men asked what her evidence was, and she said, “This boy of mine is rather handsome in appearance, and the spirit is in love with him. He will not allow him to be rational, or go to school or to archery-training, or to stay at home either, but carries him off to deserted places. My boy no longer has his natural voice but speaks in deep, ringing tones like a man; his eyes, too, are someone else’s than his own. All this makes me weep and tear my hair, and I scold my son as you would expect, but he does not recognize me. But when I decided on this journey, which I did a year ago, the spirit confessed who he was, using my son as a medium. He said he was the ghost of a man who formerly died in war, still very much in love with his wife; but the woman broke their marriage bond three days after his death by marrying another man, and from that time, he said, he had loathed the love of women and had transferred his affection to my son. And he promised that if I did not accuse him before you he would give many wonderful presents to the boy; and this rather made me change my mind. But he has been keeping me waiting for a long time now, acting as sole master of my house, with his wicked, deceitful ways.”&#xA;The Wise Man then asked her if the boy was with her, but she said, “No: I did everything to make him come, but that spirit threatened me with mention of ‘cliffs’ and ‘abysses,’ saying he would kill my son if I accused him here.”&#xA;“Don’t worry,” said the Wise Man; “he will not kill him when he has read this,” and he brought a letter out of his pocket and gave it to the woman; it was addressed to the spirit, and contained threats and warnings. (pp. 83–84)&#xA;This story has many of the elements of what may be found today, including a setting of family therapy, decided dysfunctionality and marked changes in behavior by the individual possessed, identification of the offending spirit, and threats and warnings by the exorcist.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cf. Hiltebeitel 1989a and Mayer’s study of the phenomenon in the Nyingmapa sect of Tibetan Buddhism (1996:109–132). In the latter case, Śiva as Bhairava and Rudra/Maheśvara is tamed and converted to Buddhism.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;For more on the cuṛail, see Chapter 12.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Pakaslahti, personal communication October 2001.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;See Pakaslahti 1998:139. Dwyer (1998:11ff.) statistically analyzed the results of interviews with 734 patients or their caregivers. He discovered that 35 percent of women and 26 percent of men believed their afflictions were caused by bhūt-prets and that half of both female and male respondents believed that they were harmed by occult practitioners. The biggest differential was between married and single persons: “68 per cent of married persons as opposed to 28 per cent of single persons, in fact, accused their enemies of directly harming them by means of sorcery” (p. 12). Dwyer has much to say about this.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Information from Pakaslahti, confirmed by my own observations. I am indebted to him for taking me to Bālājī in April 2001. Casual visitors to Bālājī may examine the immediate surroundings of the main temple, including the pitṛsthān behind it. On a wide dirt track immediately behind the temple, the visitor may see on any day a fairly large number of people with large heavy stones either balanced on their heads or placed on several parts of their supine bodies. These are meant to press on the bhūt-prets in order to help expel them from the victims’ bodies. These stones are clearly much heavier than an ordinary person could bear. The victims might remain motionless in those positions for a few minutes or a few hours before family members struggle to remove the stones. The pitṛsthān rises on a hill behind the temple and resembles a graveyard of stone tumuli. These are, in fact, commemorative stones to deceased ancestors whose possessed and exorcised descendants have placed them there. This is also a site for ordeals. The “clinics” (a very inadequate word) such as I describe here are quite small, consisting of a room or two in houses outside the main temple.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Seidel 1987:228. The bureaucratization of celestial regions and netherworlds in China has long been a source of discussion; see Nickerson 1996.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Davis 2001:61.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ibid.:95. Davis comments (101ff.) on the striking similarity of exorcism rituals with Song dynasty criminal proceedings.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ibid.:2001:106, also 46. The notion of an army of spirits is not unique to India and China. In Uganda this notion has been elevated to real armies, battles for national political control, and mass murder; see Behrend 1999.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Davis 2001:45ff. for accounts of the exorcistic services of fashi, a somewhat amorphous class of ritual specialists who could be Daoist priests, laymen, or spirit-mediums. See also Schipper 1993:49ff. on the category of “barefoot master.” The fashi is the lowest-ranking priest in the Daoist hierarchy. He commands spirit militias filled with petty demons, hungry ghosts, and wandering spirits, and his troops “save the people, fight evil, and heal the sick” (ibid.:50).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Davis 2001:106.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cf. Shulman 1994:7f&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Davis 2001:109.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Seidel 1987:229. See also Eder 1973:194ff., passim, on the division of the Chinese universe into yin (darkness) and yang (light): “A shen, a good spirit or god, comes from the beneficent half of the universe; a kuei, a demon or spectre from the opposite half. Every good in the world comes from a shen, every evil is inflicted by a kueï” (p. 195). Furthermore, “[a]fter death the soul is helplessly exposed to hordes of spirits” (p. 194). Only through the grace of bodhisattvas can these beings be saved. Note the vague resonance of this with the rationale behind the increasingly popular mass exorcisms of the living in contemporary American Christianity documented by Cuneo 2001. For complex demonologies in the Hindukush, with Indic, Chinese, and Central Asian influence, see Jettmar 1975:219ff.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Pakaslahti 1998:132.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Goudriaan 1977:145; this is in a collection of Balinese hymns written in very corrupt Sanskrit.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cf. Īśānaśivagurudevapaddhati 43.68. For more on Khaḍgarāvaṇa, see Chapters 10 and 12.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cf. Sen 1971:701–702. Sen gives the etymological meanings of bhar(a) as “weight, load, cargo; full” and of bhara as “to fill up, to thrust in.” These meanings are a short step to possession. Nevertheless, I am unable to find uses of the Sanskrit √bhṛ in the sense of possession; usually it has little meaning beyond the literal “excess, bearing; burden, weight, mass, bulk, fullness.” Hints, such as ṚV 1.60.5, vājaṃbhara, hardly serve as evidence. Östör 1980 notes the Bengali ānanda korā (to make joy), a joy that serves as the “the basis of devotion to and possession by Bhairab, Śiva’s deputy in the gājan” (p. 138). Their merrymaking, their ānanda, is a result of consumption of large quantities of country wine. See also Bellamy’s observation noted in Chapter 2, n. 196.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Sen 1971:701.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Bhattacharyya 1986:172.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ibid.:59–75, 180–181. Alternative terms for māthār golmāl are māthā-khārāp (bad-head), māthā-garam (hot-head), and the Sanskrit borrowing unmāda (insanity) (p. 65). Maloney (1976:132) adds the Bengali mukh-lāge (evil face). See also Gonda 1969 for a detailed study of early Indian (and Indo-Iranian) notions of the nature and consequences of eye contact. On the evil eye, ághoracakṣuḥ (Ṛgveda 10.85.44), átjfhoreṇa cákṣusā (Atharvaveda 14.2.12), etc., see pp. 33ff.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;E.g., Netratantra 19.2. As we see in Chapter 12, the curse of the evil eye is quite predominant in this text of the end of the first millennium C.E.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I am grateful to Amitava Bhattacharji for this information.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;On the manifestations of naẓar and its relationship to desire and caste, see Pocock 1992. See also Kapadia 2000:182, for remarks on the evil eye (tirusti &amp;lt; Skt. dṛṣṭi) in Tamil.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Without citing sources, Maloney gives two additional Sanskrit words: kudṛṣṭi (weak sight, evil or sinister eye, heterodox opinion or doctrine) and pāpadṛṣṭi (sin-sight). These are, however, common enough in Sanskrit. Cf. Maloney 1976:128.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Bhattacharyya 1986:181. Note Bhattacharya’s alternation between the non-retroflex and retroflex “l.”&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;McDaniel 1990:21 and passim; see also McDaniel 1988:87–99.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;McDaniel 1988; idem 1990:91; also Caldwell 1996:207. I have corrected the transliteration and diacritics of both Bhattacharyya and McDaniel.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;McDaniel 1988:87, 96.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ibid.:87.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ibid.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Molesworth 1857:76.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Molesworth states in his introduction that his sources consisted of paṇḍits in the Konkan area of coastal Maharashtra.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Karpūramañjarī, 37–38, 243.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Tulpule and Feldhaus 1999:72.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cf. Stanley 1988:40ff.; also Sontheimer 1989b:78. Compare this with bhūt bādhā (harmful possession by a ghost); Stanley 1988:26ff. Sontheimer notes that one who is possessed by any of these the gods Birobā, Mhaskobā, and Khaṇḍobā is called devācī jhāḍ (god’s tree) (p. 193).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Wadley 1976:238. Wagle records bhūte āṅgī vāḍhu lāglī (became possessed by bhūts), āṅgāt vāḍhlā (possessed), and bhutācā asvār āṇūn (the bhūt was induced to possess) in court documents dated 1812 (1995:197, 211).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Stanley 1988:27.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ibid.:57.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ibid.:48. The district gazetteers published throughout India beginning in the 1870s and revised periodically for at least a century are also useful sources for possession. In spite of the normatively brahmanical presentation of religion in some of the volumes (e.g., the Satara District gazetteer), others try to present a more balanced view. For example, the Poona District gazetteer discusses the demigod Vetāḷa, the local demonology, and the ubiquity of belief in spirits and possession in Maharashtra; cf. Gazetteer of Bombay State: Poona District (1954:126–128).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Feldhaus 1995:48, cf. also pp. 11–13; and 126ff. for ethnographies.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ibid.:134.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Berti 1999:61–97.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Berglie 1976:86. Berglie worked with Tibetan refugee communities in Nepal and India in the early 1970s. He does not state that spirit-mediumship among the Tibetan refugees in Nepal is constituted differently from that in Tibet. It is unlikely to have accumulated significant influences from the indigenous Nepali population by that date.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Another study of possession and spirit belief among Hindus, Muslims, and Buddhist tribals in central Nepal is by Gaborieau (1975a), who has recorded statements allegedly uttered by members of a class of spirits of the dead, those who suffered accidental death, called bāyu. See also the excellent studies by Crook (1997, 1998) on oracular possession among Ladakhi Buddhists, as well as the shamanic narratives and Buddhist metanarratives that guide the process.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Srinivas 1998:134.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;In western Nepal, Gaborieau (1975b: 158ff) has noted that the word avatār is normally employed for the possession of a deity by a medium. This possession is instigated by a tantric master who calls the deities into the body of the medium. Clearly, there is a greater infusion of Indo-Aryan (IA) terminology in Nepali (an IA language) than there is in Ladakhi.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Srinivas 1998:132. See Nagano 2000:587f., for distinctions made between kinds of possessed festival mediums among the Tibetans of northern Tibet and southern Qinghai province, China: “Tibetan people generally judge the greatness of a lha pa on the basis of whether or not he can verbalize the gods’ words. In addition to that, they distinguish a lha pa from a lha pa tshab on the basis of whether he has actually been possessed. They also distinguish between lha (rang) ’bab rgyab ‘the deity itself descends from heavens’ and lha phab/’bebs ‘to make a deity descend.’” See Paper 1995:54ff., 115, for a description of four shamanic specialists in ancient China. It is possible that there is a common ancestry for these groups.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Srinivas 1998:126.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;See Mumford, who renders mi-kha as “envious talk” (1989:140).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Considerable information on possession in Nepal is in Hitchcock and Jones 1976; also Samuel 1993:194–196.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Höfer 1994. This exemplary work is first and foremost a linguistic study, though this inevitably leads to a “thick description” of Tamang shamanic ritual. The book also includes glossaries of Tamang, Tibetan, and Nepali words. Admirably, Höfer devotes considerable space to explaining his terms.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ibid.:20. See also Gutschow 2004 for this and related shamans and oracles in Ladakh.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ibid.:26–27, 72–74.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Bakhtin 1981; cf. Mumford 1989:13ff.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Mumford makes extensive use of Bakhtin’s observations (1968, 1984) on Rabelais and Dostoevsky.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Spirits are often said to be fond of milk; see the translations of the āyurvedic texts in Chapter 12. Note also in the same chapter the discussion of the Malayalam word kaiviṣa, a kind of poisoning in which spirit possession is involved.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Mumford 1989:196ff.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ibid.:144. See also the discussion of the Madanamahārṇava in Chapter 12.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ibid.:148. Mumford adds, “The shaman regards his own exorcisms as more effective for that reason, justifying his own violent rites as the only effective way to expel demons from the community.”&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Berglie 1982a, also see Berglie 1976, 2000. For more on the dpa’-bo, see p. 304f. For a wealth of material on shamanic healing and possession in northern Tibet, much of which is clearly imprinted on Nepali Buddhist shamanic possession, see Bellezza 2005. Unfortunately, this volume came to me too late to make full use of it.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;She was a ḍākinī and one of the main consorts of Padmasambhava.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It is not without interest that the dpa’-bo call the mirror gling (“world”); cf. Berglie 1976:94. This appears to be consistent with the tenor of Buddhist philosophy. See my extended discussion of this in Chapter 11. See Bellezza 2005:23–28 for an interesting description of a number of Tibetan words for this magical mirror.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Berglie 1982b:164.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Berglie 2000:30. See also Pettigrew and Tamu (1994), who briefly describe possession among the Gurang of central Nepal. The term for possession in that dialect of Nepali is khhelye khhaba (god has caught, captured, covered) (p. 421n4).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Dietrich 1998, esp. pp. 39ff. for demonologies, pp. 160ff. for healing practices. Regrettably, the book does not include an index.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;An important study of psychiatric treatment from the textual point of view, with a few ethnographic examples, is Clifford 1984. This is discussed extensively in Chapter 12. See also Merz 1996, which describes the goddess Hāratī in the Kathmandu Valley, whose cult has arisen since the mid-twentieth century. Hāratī confers on her devotees oracular possession as well as disease, but also heals. This is consistent with evidence found elsewhere for other deities. See also Diemberger 2005 on various terms for oracles and oracular possession in southern and central Tibet.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cf. Hiltebeitel 1988, 1991, passim, esp. note 1988:275.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cf. R. L. Turner 1969:65, #1437, also #1446, āvēsika. See also Obeyesekere 1970:98 and Hiltebeitel 1988:275.

This observation requires further corroboration. That I have not seen this distinction elsewhere raises the question of whether Hancock’s informant was sharing no more than her personal syntactic sensibility.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Meyer 1986.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cf. Ramaswamy 1997.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Meyer 1986:110n2.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ibid.:110.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ibid.:258ff. More important is Klimkeit 1976.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Klimkeit’s use of term teufelstänz is thus not an accurate translation, but reflects the usage of previous scholarship extending back to the early eighteenth century and Ziegenbalg. Clearly “devil’s dance” is pejorative and must be understood in the context of Protestant missionary activity on the Malabar coast; e.g., Burnell 1894, 1896. See also Brückner 1987 and, much more extensively, 1995.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Nabokov 2000:120.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Foulston 2002:140ff.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cf. Diehl 1956:177; also Biardeau 1989b:149f., 153f. Foulston’s study is thin on linguistic data and records none from Oriya.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Foulston 2002:143.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ibid.:149.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Collins 1997:111.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Nabokov 2000:126–127.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ibid.:126–137, 159.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cf.

Another example is found in the Shilappadikaram; cf. Adigal 1965:150–151.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Lawrence 2003.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ibid.:101.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ibid.: 115. Hiltebeitel shows the same resolution of āvēsam in the Draupadī cult in northern Tamilnadu.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It is relevant here to cite Bertrand’s 2004 study of spirit possession and Buddhism in Cambodia, because what he finds resembles in part the situation in Sri Lanka. In one important way, however, it is dissimilar. In Cambodia many monks, in addition to laity, undergo possession in which they attempt to convert wayward spirits to Buddhism. This, observes Bertrand, “is a complete infraction of the Vinaya, the code of conduct that regulates the life of monks.… Trance is unacceptable for a monk, as it is proof of the absence of serenity and a lack of behavioural control” (p. 163). Thus many of these monks “chose to [temporarily] defrock rather than break the monastic rules” (ibid.). The situation in Cambodia is unique, however. The large number of new mediums there, both lay and monastic, is often interpreted “as the wish of the Buddha to aid mankind and also to pacify and educate all the souls of the dead killed under Pol Pot” (p. 166). The proximity of Buddhist monks to deity or spirit possession is discussed elsewhere as well; cf. DeCaroli 2004:25ff., 128ff.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Yocum 1982:189. It is also important to see the evidence from various first-millennium Tamil sources gathered by Hardy (1983:136–138, passim).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Yocum 1982:188ff. Anyone who has read this far would profit by referring to Yocum’s section on possession (pp. 187–194). On the matter of dating, see Tieken’s revisionist view attributing the Caṇkam poetry to the second half of the first millennium C.E. (2001) and Hart’s strong criticism of this view (2004). Both authors argue their cases well. I am not qualified to say which of the two is right. However, I must offer two observations: (1) the consensus remains that the Caṇkam poetry is of the first half of the first millennium C.E. (2) This is important because it is assumed that much of Indian devotional possession deriving from Sanskrit traditions and sources (e.g., from the traditions based on the Bhāgavata Parāṇa) ultimately derives from Tamil texts and religiosity. Tieken proposes to reverse this. If this were true (and I do not see a definitive solution), then the history of devotional, oracular possession would have to be revised, placing the time of its popularization a half a millennium later and its locus more squarely in Sanskritic rather than Tamil religiosity.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Hardy comments on the female presence in Tamil possession and ecstatic dancing: “Therefore it may not be accidental that in later bhakti religion, where these forms of worship appear again, the psychology of religious awareness is ‘female’” (1983:140).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The south Indian origin of what he rather flatly calls “emotional bhakti” is one of the main themes of Hardy’s Viraha-Bhakti.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Vogt 1999:xi.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Wirz 1954:14ff.; also Scott 1994:16, passim.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Scott 1994:279.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Wirz 1954:14ff.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Vogt 1999:13.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ibid.:11, table 2.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ibid.:109ff.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ibid.:xi.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Exceptions to this perhaps harsh assertion may nevertheless be cited, e.g., Hiltebeitel, Sax, Korom, and certainly others.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Vogt’s psychological interpretations (ibid.:74ff.) are indebted to the work of J. L. Moreno, the founder of “sociometry” and “psychodrama.” Her interpretations are intriguing and often convincing. However, she does not support her otherwise good arguments for application of Moreno’s ideas with reasons why Moreno’s psychodrama is more compelling than Freudian or other allied psychoanalytic theories. Moreno, for better or worse, stands beyond the pale of Freudian and other more medicalized systems that dominate psychological perspectives of scholars in the humanities and that have, partly for this reason, achieved greater subtlety and nuancing than Moreno’s views.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ibid.:130.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ibid.:48, yakunte dharmayan ana-kirima (Simhala); see also pp. 84–100.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;See Walters 2000 for a powerful critique of the uses and misuses of the Pāli vaṃsas by the authors themselves, nationalist Sri Lankans of the nineteenth and twentieth century, and European scholars of the same period. Despite many valuable insights, Walters is much too (fashionably) zealous in stigmatizing the textualists upon whom his own work depends.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Scott’s postcolonial positionings are much more sophisticated than Vogt’s. The latter was clearly unfamiliar with Scott’s work. My comments above on the freedom of continental European scholarship to work outside the present trends of post-colonialism, etc., should be tempered by such admissions.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Vogt 1999:131.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Scott 1994:228. In spite of this, it must be noted, Scott appears to be unaware of what these virtuous commands actually are. Although he adds that aṇaguna “conveys in fact the very force of the Buddha’s moral authority” (p. 25), he appears not to have studied the Buddhism that he admits rests at the basis of this healing process.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Caldwell 1996:201.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ibid.:202.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Freeman 2001:187, 384n1.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cf.

Zvelebil 1988:145–146, 2000:185, where the word is transliterated ja:ya. Zvelebil does not comment on why ja:ya is exclusively a male enterprise. He adds: “Foretelling the future, divination, and possession are obviously part of an archaic layer of Irula tribal religion” (ibid.). See also Zvelebil’s brief notes on pe:y/pe:, 2000:188.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Hutton 1921a, esp. 178ff; 1921b, esp. 192ff.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ibid.1921b:xv.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ibid.:193.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ibid.1921a:180.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;See Viswa Shanti Devi Yajña Committee, Viswa Shanti Devi Yajña (2004). A “world peace sacrifice to the goddess” (viśva-śānti-devī-yajña) was performed at that time. All quotations are from pp. 11–15 of the book. I am grateful to Loriliai Biernacki for lending this to me.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The Web site &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.hindubooks.org/temples/assam/kamakhya/page23.htm&#34;&gt;www.hindubooks.org/temples/assam/kamakhya/page23.htm&lt;/a&gt; states cogently that the festival is “so called because of the tremendous sound produced by the instruments such as drum, dhole, etc.” This argues for a more shamanistic identity of debaddhani.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The chapbook says nine are possessed, but Loriliai Biernacki reports that, according to her informants, the number is not fixed, and as many as fifteen have been possessed in previous years.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cf. the descriptions of possession found in the principal āyurvedic texts; see Chapter 12.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Wadley 1976:235. Her main sources for these words are Berreman 1963 and Planalp 1956.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I am in no position to comment authoritatively on the distribution of these words.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Henry 1981:303; Lambert 1988:356.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Fuchs 1964.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;McClintock 1990:37, 47.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;See the Gujarat State Gazetteers: Broach District 1961: 121, 124; also p. 124 for a vivid description of the rite of exorcism.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Wagle 1995:194, 198.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;McClintock 1986:42–47. Bhattacharyya’s discussion is recommended for its linguistic sensitivity.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;On Vodoun possession by loa, the local spirits, see Hurston 1938: “The person mounted does nothing of his own accord. He is the horse of the loa until the spirit departs. Under the whip and guidance of the spirit-rider, the ‘horse’ does and says many things he or she would never have uttered un-ridden” (p. 221).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;phaḍ ity anena mantreṇa tatrāśvārohaṇa viśet | Āgamarahasyam 3899ab, 2:330.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Macdonald 1975:327n5, for regional variants of this word. Dietrich 1998:259 and passim, records the word dhami as a rural variant.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Viswa Shanti Devi Yajña Committee (2004):15.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cf. Mumford 1989:148n12; also Aziz 1978:52ff. Mumford labels sngags pas as “magicians” who practice “violent” means of exorcism. In this sense, he may be misrepresenting the teachings and practices of sngags pas themselves, but correctly representing the views of local Tibetan villagers in remote parts of Nepal who, over centuries of direct contact and folklore, have come to see them as such.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;See, for example, the Sanskrit manuscripts on possession discussed in Chapter 11.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Although this is correct in its Sanskritic reference, Gellner notes that in Newari the word vaidya refers to “any type of healer who is not directly possessed” (2001:97).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;See Carstairs and Kapur 1976.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Brückner 1995:89ff.; Honko 1998:341. Claus is more specific, stating that this is used for a spirit medium (1979:29).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Macdonald 1975:118.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Höfer 1994:18. Macdonald’s designation is also too restrictive for Gellner, who, like Höfer, regards a jhṃkri as a shaman in a more general sense; cf. Gellner 1994:31.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ibid.; also Merz 1996:347. Hāratī, the “goddess who steals,” is a Hindu-Buddhist crossover deity. She is worshipped by both Hindus and Buddhists, her temple ritual is performed by Newar Buddhist Vajrācāryas, and she is related to other deities of possession, including her husband Unmatta (“Drunken”) Bhairava and several of their children.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cf. Gellner 1988.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Gellner 1994:31 (= 2001:202).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Gellner 1994:32 (2001:203).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Gellner 1992:326ff.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Höfer 1994:17–19.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Gaborieau 1975a:73, 76ff.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Berglie 1976.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Dietrich 1998:119–159.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Karim 1988:277–309.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The kabirāj is also discussed by Risley 1891:362–366.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Karim 1988:295. The word bhasan, writes Karim, “suggests one who is floated” (p. 307n15).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Shukla 1980:167.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Caldwell 1996:223n23. It is of little value to discuss words found in dictionaries without comment or contextualization. Thus it suffices to merely mention that the old standard English and Tamil Dictionary, by Winslow, Spaulding, and Pillai (1888 [1842]), lists the following: under “possession by an evil spirit”–tēvarālan, veṟiyāṭṭu, āvēsam (p. 1019); under “oracle”–āvēsakkāram, tēvarālan, paṭimatton.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Freeman 2001:190.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Inglis 1985:90–91; for a similar list see Diehl 1956:221ff. Inglis studied the similarities between possession dancers and the local manufacture of clay images, both serving as vessels for the divine. We have seen this image of the possessed as a vessel in Tibetan and in Tulu, via Sanskrit. Doubtless it occurs elsewhere in South Asia as well and is a common image elsewhere in the world. For example, Spanish attests vasos preferidos (chosen vessels) and cajitas (little boxes), for those who accept certain spirits for oracular and curative purposes; cf. Kay F. Turner 1992:126.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Lawrence 2003.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Maloney 1980:242.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ibid.:242ff.; for more on the evil eye in the Maldives, see pp. 258ff. This is not unlike a brujo in Mexico. On the evil eye in Sri Lanka, see Wirz 1954:178f.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;On Telugu, see Knipe 2001. He observes that the Telugu word for “possession speech” is vakku (cf. the observation by Lawrence in Sri Lanka) and that “possession ritualists who have one or more neighborhood goddesses ‘come to’ or ‘come on’ them, to employ common Telugu parlance for possession [is] an event also known substantively by the word pūnakam” (p. 344). In a more recent article (2004), Knipe states, importantly, that “Godavari Brahmans are reluctant to mention āveśa, samāveśa, or related experiences, whereas pūnakam, the moment when Ammavāru or a deceased person descends on the occupant of a gaddi [a ‘seat’ for a possession ritualist, shared with the goddess], is eagerly discussed by all ritualists who claim routine divine visitation, as well as by their clients and assembled audiences who share each detail with the village and town folk at large” (p. 440). See also Nuckolls (1991a), who mentions that in Telugu a person on or in whose body a deity comes is called bhaktudù (m) or bhakturàlu (f) (&amp;lt; Skt. bhakta; a devotee). I suspect that these words have broader semantic fields.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;However, see the 1961 edition of the Broach (present-day Bharuch) district gazetteer (123ff.). Spirits are referred to as bhūts, as is the case all over northern India, the word for possession is vaḷgan. Spirits are divided into family or household spirits (bharṇābhūt) and outside spirits (baharṇābhūt). If a man remarries after the death of his first wife, it is believed that the spirit of the first wife might possess the second. However, if post-mortem rites are properly performed, the spirit will be pacified. An array of spirits and goddesses of lower-caste Hindus are believed to be responsible for the possession. More fieldwork must be done on possession in Gujarat to fill out this very thin picture.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;See, for example, Troisi 1976, which lists more than five hundred studies of this “tribe,” as it is still classified, of Bengal, Orissa, and Bihar, most of them in English, in many of which, doubtless, one can find references to spirit possession.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Nevertheless, I am reminded by William Sax that though “everyone gets possessed, high caste and low, upper caste people tend to deny it of themselves [at least in Garhwal], and attribute it to the subalterns” (personal communication, November 1999). This he attributes to brahmanical image-conjuring rather than suppression, though he does see an effort of Hindu nationalists to suppress possession and other kinds of popular Hinduism. This prurience is little different from that of their detested Victorian predecessors. Pakaslahti has hard evidence to back up Sax’s observations: “Seeking help from Bālājī is not related to illiteracy, low caste status or rural domicile, as the majority of the clientele has average or better than average education, belong to the higher castes and are of urban domicile” (1998:164).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ramanujan 1986a:69.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Knipe notes that vaidika brahmans in the community he has studied in coastal Andhra Pradesh do “not enter into a heightened state of consciousness after drinking soma.” Yet they are “well aware of the emotional rhetoric of transformation, most dramatically in the large-scale sharing of soma in a śrauta sacrifice such as the vājapeya, pauṇḍarīka, sarvatomukha or the currently rare agniṣṭoma for a newly initiated member of the soma society” (2004:438).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;For example, the presence in the Draupadī cult’s Mahābhārata of a Muslim devotee, Muttāl Rāvuttaṉ, who serves Draupadī by accepting blood sacrifices for her and receiving impure offerings, including gāñjā, opium, cigars, and arrack. At one temple, red and green chili peppers are offered to his dog. Cf. Hiltebeitel 1988:101–127. It is difficult to imagine a more non-brahmanical Mahābhārata.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cf. Prabhu 1977; Honko 1998:389–421; also Knipe 1989. It is important not to commit the error of assuming that because the vocabulary of possession in northern India is in a large number of instances derived from Sanskrit, while in southern India it is less the case, possession in the north is more inclusive of upper classes. North Indian languages are Indo-Aryan while south Indian languages are not, so the idiom of possession in the north would “naturally” be more Sanskritic. Similarly, the presence of a Dravidian vocabulary for possession in the south cannot be used as evidence that the possession is somehow non-brahmanical. Correlation of language with culture is an idea that is dying all too slowly; one would have thought that this would have ceased sixty-five years ago with the publication of Frans Boas’s Race, Language and Culture (1940).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Note the superannuation of the term aṇaṅku in present-day Tamil (or Malayalam) by the concept (and term) śakti.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cf. Jones 1968. See now Davidson 2002 for a wealth of evidence that tribal practices influenced the development of Mahāyāna Buddhism in the first millennium C.E.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Berglie 1996. This epic is still transmitted largely orally, through bards of virtually every stratum of Tibetan society. No standard edition of the text exists, nor is one likely to be produced anytime soon. Geoffrey Samuel has also done important work on the traditions and shamanic dimensions of the Gesar epic; see Samuel 1991, 1994, 2005.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ibid.:17.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I agree with Gellner (2001), following Dumont and Pocock, that “it is probably better to talk only of Great Traditions, which certainly exist, and to contrast them with ‘popular religion.’ To call the latter a Little Tradition either appears to imply that it is organized in the same way as the Great Traditions (which it is not) or that it constitutes a pool of survivals of pre-Hindu or pre-textual practices (which is doubtful)” (p. 100). Here I equate “folk” with Gellner’s “popular religion.”&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cf. Rigopoulos 1993:54n18. Rigopoulos reports that a devotee of Sai Baba, possessed by Khaṇḍobā, supplied information on Sai Baba’s personal history (47f., 53f.) (which, unfortunately, Rigopoulos accepts as pramāṇa). Sontheimer (1989a, 1989b, and elsewhere) also supports the folk vs. classical Hinduism dichotomy. But the dichotomy Sontheimer writes about is based only on recent historical and contemporary arrangements.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cf. Gellner 2001:203. For certain spiritual practices (upāsana) that involve possession of Hanumān, see Śrīmālī n.d.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Gellner writes: “a Maharjan (Farmer) man from a village south of Lalitpur who appeared one day in Kwā Bāhāḥ (an important Buddhist sacred complex) and claimed to be possessed by Kwābāju, i.e. Śākyamuni Buddha, was met with polite but definite scepticism” (2001:211). For a description of a spirit medium who “dances” Śākyamuni Buddha in contemporary Singapore, see DeBernardi 1995:158.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;See Holt 2004a, 2004b for Viṣṇu possession in Sri Lanka; and Gellner 1988 [2001:102] on the possession of the king of Nepal: “He was considered to be like Vishnu and to be possessed by him in ritual contexts.”&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;See also Dietrich 1998:236, for an account of a Nepali healer who claims possession by Brahmā, Viṣṇu, and Śiva, among others.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Not only is the latter apparent from much of the evidence presented in this volume, but one of the primary areas of Indological study in the twentieth century was the determination of Aryan and non-Aryan in early Sanskrit literature. See, for example, Deshpande 1995.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cf. Hiltebeitel 1991.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Erndl states:&#xA;In reading about South Asia, one often gets the impression that possession, along with related ecstatic behavior, belongs to the “little tradition” and is thus largely confined to the lower castes and the poor and uneducated in rural areas. However, in my experience, the phenomenon of possession in the cult of Śerāṇvālī is widespread throughout the population. I have witnessed Goddess possession in both village and urban settings, among low and high castes (including Brahmins), the poor and the rich, the uneducated and the educated, Sikhs as well as Hindus. (1996:179)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Bell argues that ritualization is not a “standardized process” of traditionalization, but that:&#xA;[r]itual can be a strategic way to “traditionalize,” that is, to construct a type of tradition, but in so doing it can also challenge and renegotiate the very basis of tradition to the point of upending much of what has been seen as fixed previously or by other groups. Examples abound, ranging from the ascetic internalization of the Vedic sacrifice and the iconoclasm of early Ch’an Buddhism to the Reformation’s challenge to papal authority through a recreation of the free outpouring of the spirit to the early church. (1992:124)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;For an accessible general discussion of this, see Bryant 2001, ch. 5. As I write this in Iowa, I am surrounded by the states of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, Missouri, South Dakota and Nebraska, while the best-known place names in the region are those of the Mississippi River and the city of Chicago. All of these are Native American names, the total number of which by now surely exceeds the number of Native Americans in these areas who have any knowledge of their ancestral languages. Although an extreme example, it is nevertheless not wholly dissimilar to the results found elsewhere of linguistic and cultural contact.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Mayaram 2000.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;See F. Smith 1987:59–63, 121–223.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;See Pollock 1990.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Dirks 1992:231. Possession within epic or other narrativized ritual performance in south India yields rather similar results; cf. Hiltebeitel, Brückner, Biardeau, Caldwell, Freeman, and others.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Zvelebil 1981:82. See also Stewart 1995:574ff. for a modern story of a faked devotional possession during the life of Haridāsa, a devotee of Śrī Caitanya in the early sixteenth century.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Yocum 1982:144. There is earlier testimony for this in the Mahābhārata tale of Aśvatthāman, discussed in Chapter 6.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am particular grateful to Alexis Sanderson, who brought the unpublished Śaiva texts to my attention, shared with me his copious transcriptions and notes on them, and eventually went through a draft of this chapter, offering many positive suggestions, some of which are worthy of specific attribution. I am also indebted to E. Muralidhara Rao and H. V. Nagaraja Rao for help in transcribing a number of Sanskrit manuscripts from Telugu script into Nāgarī; to the participants of a conference on Tantra and Daoism held at Boston University in April 2002, especially John Lagerwey, David Germano, and Ronald Davidson; and to Wendi Adamek for explicating the Chinese and patiently answering many questions that must have seemed basic to her.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;BECAUSE OF THE MULTIDIMENSIONAL NATURE OF THIS STUDY, I have sought and received help in the form of information, discussion, and, eventually, critical reading of different parts of the book from many friends, colleagues, and acquaintances. This particularly long gestation period of a decade and a half has, therefore, placed me in their debt, a debt that I am delighted to acknowledge. First, I extend special thanks to Frank Korom, William (Bo) Sax, and Lindsey Harlan for reading early drafts of the chapters on theory and ethnography. Thankfully, Frank, Bo, and Lindsey think very differently about both anthropology and religion and offered correspondingly different critiques, all of which helped me immensely. I am also heavily indebted to Chris Minkowski for comments on the Mahābhārata chapter, to George Thompson and Steven Lindquist for comments and moral support on the chapter on possession in the Vedas, to Alexis Sanderson for time-consuming and selfless assistance on the second of the two Tantra chapters, and to Claudia Welch for insight and extensive comments on the Āyurveda chapter. I am grateful for the University of Iowa International Programs office for grants that allowed me to travel to Kerala for fieldwork on Āyurvedic mental health care in 2002 and 2004. I can confidently say that I could not have accomplished any of my work in Kerala were it not for the ready kindness of N. V. Ramachandran of Palakkad, to whom I remain heavily indebted. His ethnographic skills as well as knowledge of local medical traditions and, conveniently, all the back roads of Kerala were decisive in that work.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Credit to the linked tweet that spurred a discussion in a private group where certain questions were raised.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s the origin of the concept of 7 Rishis?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;How did it evolve over time?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Who were the 7 Rishis?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Is there a canonical set of 7 Rishis? If so, why the names keep changing across texts?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These are interesting questions and Rigveda should be the last place one would typically look. Even the term saptarishi is sparse in RV (1 or 2), but that&amp;rsquo;s where I wanted to start.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

With a minimal patina, these seem to have been absorbed from a shaiva text. The Skt text mentions 8 kAtyAyanI-s, but the text gives 9: &amp;ldquo;aShTau bhUta-rAj~nI-kAtyAyanI-vidyAH paThita-mAtreNa sidhyanti ||&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The sumbhakAtyAyanI is probably a bauddha insert into the original set of the remaining 8. The rite is prescribed thus:&#xA;The sAdhaka goes to a cemetery and repeats one of the kAtyAyanI mantra 1008 times for three days. He offers them blood arghya in a calvaria when they manifest.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As I&amp;rsquo;ve said many times here, sometimes drawing the howls of the dull-witted, the aindra system of the core RV is superior to others. That, unlike the late Vedic prAjApatya system, privileges kShatra spirit inspired by the fort-breaking god himself. The sUkta of apratiratha aindra or the gautama&amp;rsquo;s long string of gAyatrI-s starting with &amp;ldquo;nakirindra…&amp;rdquo; is largely more inspiring than a prAjApatya lesson.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another is the teaching of indra. What is more inspiring than indra cutting down the likes of trishiras tvAShTra or hurling shambara off the mountain for his Arya votary, the atithigva. That spirit permeates old IE tradition: you see it in Thor, you see it in Zeus &amp;amp; even the Zoroastrian Iranians cannot pass verethraghana by.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today the Sāvitrī is universally used by all dvija-s for their saṃdhyopāsanā/ Savitrupāsanā. However, we know that the saṃdhyā rite goes back to at least the Indo-Iranian period. This raises the question as to whether there was a Savitrupāsanā before the extant Sāvitrī was composed by Viśvāmitra. It is notable that Viśvāmitra himself specifically mentions that the god is worshiped 3 times in a day.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;js_include&#34; includetitle=&#34;false&#34; newlevelforh1=&#34;5&#34; unfilled url=&#34;https://vishvAsa.github.io/devaH/vedAH_Rk/shAkalam/saMhitA/vishvAsa-prastutiH/03/054/11_hiraNyapANiH_savitA.md&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;details open&gt;&lt;summary&gt;&lt;h5&gt;११ हिरण्यपाणिः सविता ...{Loading}...&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;हि᳓रण्यपाणिः &lt;strong&gt;सविता᳓&lt;/strong&gt; सुजिह्व᳓स्&lt;br&gt;&#xA;त्रि᳓र् आ᳓ दिवो᳓ &lt;strong&gt;विद᳓थे+++(=यज्ञे)+++ प᳓त्यमानः&lt;/strong&gt;+++(= पतित्वं कामयमानः)+++ । &lt;br&gt;&#xA;देवे᳓षु च सवितः श्लो᳓कम् &lt;strong&gt;अ᳓श्रेर्&lt;/strong&gt;+++(=प्राप्नुयाः)+++&lt;br&gt;&#xA;आ᳓द्+++(=अनन्तरं)+++ अस्म᳓भ्यम् &lt;strong&gt;आ᳓ सुव&lt;/strong&gt; सर्व᳓-तातिम् ॥&lt;/p&gt;</description>

However, it is not entirely clear what mantra is meant by this name.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One likely candidate is the tryambaka R^ik. However, there is another archaic connection that should be mentions in this regard (especially given that the kAlottara mentioned the amR^itarudra in the context of atharvan mantra-s). Chapter 3 of the atharvashiras, after describing the universal form of rudra, provides a verse corresponding to the famous R^ik RV 8.48.3, thereby connecting amR^ita and rudra:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Clearly there was the classic viShNu-focal system of vedic and earlier IE provenance; then there was the more local evolution in the Indo-Iranian borderlands of the vAsudeva-sAttvata tradition. The earlier harivaMsha was definitely focused on a version of the sAttvata tradition. But there was a parallel strand of vaiShNava tradition predominant among the vaikhAnasa-s &amp;amp; and an early strand of pA~ncharAtra-s that was closer to vaidika focality on viShNu.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The viShNu purANa tries bring the 2 together by giving devakIputra the focus of the &amp;ldquo;earthly&amp;rdquo; expression of the sAttvata religion a central place in the narrative. rAmachandra aikShvAkava is not given much space in this text. However, it goes on to clarify that the saMkarShaNa &amp;amp; vAsudeva are only amshAmsha, i.e 1/p*1/q fractions of the primal viShNu. So these avatAra-s are only parts or minor parts of viShNu, namely two hairs dropping off from him. Thus, it places the sAttvata heroes in more meaningful hierarchy with respect to the god himself. But like the shuklayajurveda verse there is a certain fractality. This little part of viShNu can itself have tremendous potency as exhibited by the saMkarShaNa and the vAsudeva.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

But there was a parallel strand of vaiShNava tradition predominant among the vaikhAnasa-s &amp;amp; and an early strand of pA~ncharAtra-s that was closer to vaidika focality on viShNu.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The viShNu purANa tries bring the 2 together by giving devakIputra the focus of the &amp;ldquo;earthly&amp;rdquo; expression of the sAttvata religion a central place in the narrative. rAmachandra aikShvAkava is not given much space in this text. However, it goes on to clarify that the saMkarShaNa &amp;amp; vAsudeva are only amshAmsha, i.e 1/p*1/q fractions of the primal viShNu. So these avatAra-s are only parts or minor parts of viShNu, namely two hairs dropping off from him. Thus, it places the sAttvata heroes in more meaningful hierarchy with respect to the god himself. But like the shuklayajurveda verse there is a certain fractality. This little part of viShNu can itself have tremendous potency as exhibited by the saMkarShaNa and the vAsudeva.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The oldest surviving yavana tradition, Mycenaean separates Enyalios from Ares. I have wondered if there was a skanda-vishAkha kind of pairing even in the yavana world. In support of such a twinning he was identified with Janus Quirinus of the romaka world. The goddess Enyo also might have been a faint reflex of the devasenA like deity whose echo we seen in the romaka world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The yavana deity Hephaistos is a cognate of tvaShTR^i &amp;amp; like him forges the various weapons of the gods, including the arrows of Zeus as we saw before. He had 3 assistants the Cyclopes known as Brontes, Steropes and Arges who specifically made the thunderbolt of Zeus. In addition to these 3, he is said to have made several robots that assisted him in his forge. The 3 Cyclopes may be seen as the cognates of the 3 R^ibhu-s who augment the productions of tvaShTR^i in the Arya world. The specific act of making the thunderbolt appears to have been transferred to these 3 in the yavana world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the vaidika tradition it doesn&amp;rsquo;t take the same color as in later tradition. The great emperor trasadasyu is termed ardhadeva but only that. While deva &amp;amp; martya are distinct, the deva can assume any form for particular reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thus indra assumed the form of AkUpAra the gigantic tortoise. indra also appeared to medhAtithi kANva as a ram. indra took the form of the hyaena to conquer the asura-s. indra took the form of a gautama v1 to spy on the asura-s. viShNu took the form of a vAmana to conquer the dAnava-s. It also seems that it was understood that the boar that bore the Earth was viShNu. The gods might appear as birds to sit on the barhiSh to take the offerings.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It helps us develop positive qualities and good aspirations in a very deliberate, yet very enjoyable way. As an example, consider the following mundane example: &amp;ldquo;For a straight back, imagine your head hangs from a thread (ballerinas do).&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Among other things, this reverence of awesome nature and upholders of dharma engenders reverence for nature, and renews of faith in the grandest ideals of this dharma.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It may even improve our performance at various tasks.&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Example: The ancestor effect: Thinking about our genetic origin enhances intellectual performance (article &lt;a href=&#34;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ejsp.778/abstract&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Not answering prayer stuff (considered in a separate subsection).&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Personal note: - To me, the influence of (connection with) the deva-s is limited to being the influence of concepts, symbols and perception on minds (and ultimately behavior) - yet what satisfying influence that can be!&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;answering-prayers-or-not&#34;&gt;Answering prayers, or not.&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The greatest value of deva-s is in the realm of feelings and sentiment, as explained elsewhere. Answering material requests (like some ATM) is secondary.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Importantly, the deva-s mostly do not alter or abort the laws of the universe (which makes sense because they are themselves part of Rta framework). As GA said: &amp;ldquo;Too many people think tantra is about churning out supernatural effects that defy the operating laws of the universe at an extremely visible, public level. NO. Such effects are known &amp;amp; do exist, albeit at a private level.&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;An illustrative example: From bhAgavata-purANa 10.24, the central message of kRShNa is &amp;ldquo;Indra does not cause rains; it is karma and natural processes. You ought to adore karma instead.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;He then asks the cowherds to adore the hillock and cattle. This, considering the preceding message, is but symbolic and about as meaningful emotionally (to the cowherds) as appeasing the clouds.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;So, at best, the govardhana incident can be considered an argument against deities that answer to material requests of humans; while endorsing the continuation of pUja as an emotional and symbolic act.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

Yet the lay H today would worship old deities like rudra or viShNu in images. Similarly, the shruti recommends that all Indo-Aryans take the name of bhArata in their fire ritual.+++(??)+++ Moreover in the specific ritual of the clan they worship 3 goddesses sarasvatI, iLA, bhAratI. IMO, this bhAratI is none other the goddess of the land of the Arya-s.+++(5)+++ Its extent &amp;amp; location has been changing over the ages. It might change again or vanish if the H lose the war their enemies are waging on them. But its existence is not in doubt. Hence, making some personification of that deity in a material medium is something keeping with the rest of the religion.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The Germanic occurrence of a boar is hence interesting.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;ve convergently suspect that the north- Germanic Hild swine as Odr was an ectype of Odin giving a direct link to the rudrian divo varAha of the Arya-s. That is indeed an important connection &amp;ndash; good job! I&amp;rsquo;d add that the rudrian connection is augmented by the inheritance of the boar nature by the sons of rudra in gotama&amp;rsquo;s incantation upon his direct vision of the marut-s:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Whereas some RV vipra-s mention gifts of camels Arya-s are not named after camels, unlike horses.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The etymology of the goddess chAmuNDA has mystified old &amp;amp;modern scholars alike. The great mantravAdin bhAskararAya correctly realized that it might stem from  some local (non-Aryan) tongue.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Within the Sanskrit tradition the paurANika-s have attempted to give it various functional explanations within the context of the battles fought by the goddess. While the most prevalent one is in mahAsaravatI cycle relating to the killing of chaNDa and muNDa -&amp;gt; chAmuNDA there are alternative versions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As a young boy, Chandesha found that cows were poorly cared for and started taking care of a small herd. To pass the time, he made a sand Shiva lingam and would pour some milk on it as a simple offering. When Datta, his father, heard about this, he came to the field to scold his son. Chandesha was deep in meditation in front of the sand lingam, and he did not notice his father.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Gods are conscious entities with whom we can connect (given mutual desire and effort).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Connecting with them can elevate us in myriad ways (See &lt;a href=&#34;benefits&#34;&gt;benefits&lt;/a&gt; page).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The Gods gain NOTHING from connecting to us, or receiving our adoration. They don&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;feed&amp;rdquo; on our adulation. They are perfectly satisfied and complete - even if no human exists.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;We can be disconnected from the Gods due to spread of mental diseases (atheisms including so-called monotheisms). In such a case one has to work hard for generations to reestablish solid connection (like 20th century western pagan revivalists).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;deva-bhakta-relationship&#34;&gt;Deva-bhakta relationship&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We emphasize that to a practicing hindu, they are not remotely abstract entities like Jupiter, Mars, Neptune, Juno are to (sadly) Christianized Italians; rather they are alive and immediate in the artistic experience that is the hindu way of thought. One propitiates them regularly with various rituals (In fact, I am more observant than most) as if they were wilful entities, and questions about their imaginary nature never enter my mind when involved with hindu rituals. It is a primeval way of looking at nature and life. IshAna still lives in our rage, Indra in our stength, prithivI/ Earth in our body, herbs in our hair, sarasvatI on the tip of my tongue, agni in my speech and so on. (A lament on the fools that chose to leave this for the monotony and paleness of Abrahamisms &lt;a href=&#34;http://agnimaan.wordpress.com/2015/01/13/the-fools-that-converted/&#34;&gt;is here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I think this has to be seen in light of a theological interpretation of IE polytheism that I wish to lay out at some point if the gods are favorable &amp;ndash;the overlap of domains.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I wished to say in response to your earlier twt-disquisition where you presented the parallels between the divine twins in the Hellene world &amp;ndash; the rudrian dyad emerging from Leto &amp;amp; the Dioscuri from Leda whose names might in turn be related. I was just not upto a long theological discursion. In the H world, in the RV the ashvin-s &amp;ndash; the Dioscurian cognates are primarily rudrian. In the later tradition they become Adityan via the sharaNyu myth as you noted. Thus, the ashvin-s as sons of vivasvAn might be seen as a crossover from their original rudrian realm into the Adityan realm.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The fact that the story occurs with both Sati &amp;amp; Pārvati kind of lends support to the notion that the story is not about FIL-SIL dynamics but really goes back to the archaic Vedic meme of the Devas ostracising Rudra. Also, Dakṣa’s pointed reference to the sufficiency of the august presence of the 11 Rudras &amp;amp; express move to not recognize &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; Rudra is interesting. He also refers to the 11 Rudras’ tridents &amp;amp; Jaṭa (matted locks). Given that, it was not that Dakṣa had a problem with the “Raudra” class per se but only the great Rudra. One wonders if Dakṣa is representative of certain misled ritualists’ reluctance to give importance to &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; Rudra in favour of the 11-set.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Was Dumezilian tripartation really a PIE thing or overdone? It had a place in vedic &amp;amp; shows cognates in other IE traditions. Hence, my take is that it was an old idea present in IE tradition.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the vedic tradition it is notably emphasized as the 3 basic vyAhR^iti-s. However, given that the tradition also records several other vyAhR^iti-s of different counts adding on the basic 3, it is clear that there were other concepts in parallel to tripartation. E.g. see:  exposition of the vyAhR^iti-s.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;While the Sāvitrī remains a popular mantra among modern Hindus, most of them do not know its deity. Even of those who know Savitṛ to be the deity, few have a clear idea of the nature of this god. Most believe that he is none other than the Sun of our solar system. Yet, the RV is quite clear about him not being the same as the sun. The sun is merely one manifestation of his activity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The later itihAsa-purANa place him in the Aditya class. In the RV it may be an epithet for multiple deities, but explicitly it mentioned as an epithet for visvakarman, who in turn is an epithet of the ancient tvaShTR. tvaShTR accompanies the the wives of the gods &amp;amp; other goddesses at the ritual. He appears in a similar role accompanying the sarasvatI and sinIvAlI in the sArasvata rite. There sarasvatI is also paired with the divine eagle deity (elsewhere tArkShyo ariShTanemiH or garutmant) manifesting in an androgynous aspect as sarasvant.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We had discussed how the yavana Cynic tradition intersected with the middle pAshupata tradition culminating in the imagery of lakulIsha. We&amp;rsquo;ve suspected this intersection persisted &amp;amp;influenced other more western Roman cults. Jupiter Dolichenus is the most obvious one to investigate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;figure class=&#34;thumbnail&#34;&gt;&#xA;&#xA;    &lt;a href=&#34;../../../images/dolichenus/hungarian-dolichenus.png&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&#xA;        &lt;img src=&#34;../../../images/dolichenus/hungarian-dolichenus.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&#xA;    &#xA;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The above is his cultic image from Hungary. Imagine what associations it might have brought to mind to a coeval H or Eastern Iranic. Of course the old iconography going back to the hittite Teshub of the bull-riding deity is apparent but we talking of the Roman age: Apart from the Greek elements Nike to the left &amp;amp; Athena with her spear; bottom right note the Greco-Roman Herakles to the bottom left &amp;ndash; bridging the rudra-class of the west to the Indo-Iranic world (also lakulIsha). Above Athena note the Iranian fire altar-like emblem, keeping with the eastern locus of origin of the cult. However, in this image the fire altar is more like the Vestal fire altar (the gArhapatya equivalent of the Roman &amp;ldquo;shrauta&amp;rdquo; altars of the state), above which is the eagle of Jupiter.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The worship of this hayagrIva is still recommended in the kAlikA &amp;amp; suggests a worship of hayagrIva conjoint with the bhairava, vAsudeva, viShNu and varAha.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Was kAmaakhya in the remote past likely a shrine to the vaiShNavI ekAnaMshA?

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Erikepaius is a likely ortholog of none other than our Vṛṣākapi, who is celebrated in RV 10.86. He is described as a friend of Indra and was later identified with Viṣṇu (we do not know if that identification already existed in the RV). The great patriot Tilak identified him with the Orion region of the sky that is more commonly associated with the Hindu protogonic deity Prajāpati. We agree that this is a valid identification, and it suggests a link between the two in the ancient past. We believe that Vṛṣākapi is a rare surviving memory of a protogonic entity linked to Indra in the RV and incorporated into Zeus in the Greek world. The watery haviṣ +++(mentioned in the sUkta)+++ might be linked to the carrying of the seed of the gods by Erikepaius.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Ahadith mention Adam being created in his deity’s image. This not only shows that his deity is not only not formless, but is also finite.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the response is that “this form is not comparable to anything in this world” it still doesn’t mean there is formlessness. In that case, H will respond (from scripture) that Bhagavān’s forms are not some imitation of creation, but is fashioned of Māyā which is His own Śakti. He takes these forms solely for the benefit of the bound souls. Refer to Bhojadeva’s Tattvaprakāśikā for this.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ll generalize the problem and attempt to provide a coherent answer from H insider POV.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Problem: If you accept the proposition that a deity you worship is a later day addition to H pantheon, and perhaps even inspired by a contact with foreign tribe, how can you continue to worship without slipping into cognitive dissonance?&#xA;@halleyji please let me know if I captured the problem reasonably accurately.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Indeed the gadA is a rather late iconographic element of hanUmat. It is missing even in the classical tantrika dhyAna-s for the key hanUmat-mantra-s &amp;amp; is not mentioned in the classic mAlA-mantra. It seems to have emerged only in the medieval period in any notable way from a west Indian locus and spread widely but not universally across the subcontinent. The kali~Ngan iconography for e.g. does not show him with one.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Every God (or God family) is capable of doing all things for the devotee. This is inpsite of being closely associated with a particular trait (Eg. bRhaspati as the guru, indra as warrior, savitR as the impeller).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Just because a doctor heals well, it does not mean that he disappears as soon as he removes his coat. He can fight and engineer as well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In a sense, the basic essence of other Gods is present in every God - there is just a difference in emphasis. So, in inspired hymns, God X may say: &amp;ldquo;I am Agni, I am Indra etc..&amp;rdquo; When Agni is &amp;ldquo;angry&amp;rdquo;, it is as if the rudra aspect shines forth through him - or as if rudra fully cooperates with him, lending his features (in line with the &lt;a href=&#34;../harmony&#34;&gt;harmony&lt;/a&gt; of the Gods).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;intro&#34;&gt;Intro&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Key thing is cognizance of harmony among the deva-s - hierarchy or respect for other possible hierarchies is hair-splitting which mostly only serves polemics.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The hard &amp;ldquo;good vs evil&amp;rdquo; dichotomy is absent in the hindu milieu, as described &lt;a href=&#34;../non-evil/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

So, this willing subordination in a particular context does not necessarily imply lower power - just condescension.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ideas such as moha-shAstra, lower-vidyA etc.. help reconciliation.&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;arthavAda and nahi-nindA-nyAya&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The nature of myth. Even though myths meant to help devotional practice and adoration centered on a certain deity show conflicts and even denigration of deities - they are not to be taken literally.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The idea of &lt;a href=&#34;../generality&#34;&gt;generality&lt;/a&gt; implies that the &amp;ldquo;essence or emphasis&amp;rdquo; of God A is anyway in God B - so praise of God A is indirect praise for even God B.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;meaning-as-cult-competition&#34;&gt;Meaning as cult-competition&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Myths / imagery of one deity killing or trampling other may be understood as serving cult competition.

The first triad of heads are the usual nR^isiMha-viShNu-varAha triad; the next triad is bhairava-maheshvara-umA; then the 3 vyUha deities; the worn-out one on the top is likely hayagrIva.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One can find some parallels to vishvarUpa vibhava of viShNu from some pA~ncharAtrika texts. The above (haribhaktivilAsa quote) indeed seems to be a citation of hayashIrsha. It might also be seen as an expression of the general prescription given in the jayAkhya. However, the hayashrISha at the top makes think it might be related to the hayashIrsha-centric vishvarUpa.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well, I think we Occidentals have yet to learn the worship of ancestors; and evolution is going to teach it to us. When we become conscious that we owe whatever is wise or good or strong or beautiful in each one of us, not to one particular inner individuality, but to the struggles and sufferings and experiences of the whole unknown chain of human lives behind us, reaching back into mystery unthinkable - the worship of ancestors seems an extremely righteous thing. What is it, philosophically, but a tribute of gratitude to the past - dead relatively only alive really within us, and about us.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

No one is first always, no one is last always. Even gods of a decidedly inferior and limited character assume occasionally in the eyes of a devoted poet a supreme place above all other gods. It was necessary, therefore, for the purpose of accurate reasoning to have a name, different from polytheism, to signify this worship of single gods, each occupying for a time a supreme position, and I proposed for it the name of Kaihenotheism, that is a worship of one god after another, or of Henotheism, the worship of single gods.&amp;rdquo; [&lt;a href=&#34;https://books.google.com/books?id=DLQIAAAAQAAJ&amp;amp;dq=kulluka%20bhatta%20garga&amp;amp;pg=PA76#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=henotheism&amp;amp;f=false&#34;&gt;MM&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It has a remarkable bilingual inscription in Greek &amp;amp; Parthian dialect of the Iranian language. There Heracles is identified with the Iranic god verethraghna &amp;amp; Apollon with tishtrya. It shows that between Greek &amp;amp; Iranic branches of the IE religion the homologies could be more or less correctly sorted out with Herakles being placed in his ancestral indra-class &amp;amp; Apollo in the rudra-class. This identification is also seen in the statues produced by the Greco-Iranic king Antiochus.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

There we have:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;the wolf-headed bluish-green vAyudevI&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;brown ibex-headed agnAyI&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;sow-headed vArAhI&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;the brownish crow-headed chAmunNDI&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;darkgreen elephant-headed bhUjanA&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;snake-headed blue-green varuNAnI&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some of iconographies are not TMK seen in a surviving H text but could have once been there.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1690014417344159746.html&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;identifying-with-non-arya-deities&#34;&gt;Identifying with non-Arya deities&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What I stated above, mutatis mutandis, applies to who we see as “Non-Sanskritic” Village deities as well. This deity was likely never known to the Ṛṣis or the Āryas of that time &amp;amp; perhaps was conceived much much later. But that deity of “Non-Ārya” provenance was all along a “husk” concealing a transcendental deity with whom we are much more familiar, who was waiting for us to discover this chain/layers of deities leading up to him. Who knows?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

And against this simple criterion, the way the Hindu mind has seen plurality in the divine can only be described as insanely complex &amp;amp; beautiful. Others may point out some other &amp;ldquo;underlying unity&amp;rdquo; (nirguNabrahman, puruSa-prakRti as in sAMkhyA, etc). Yet, none of this metaphysical speculations have prevented the natural inclination of the Hindu mind to conceptualize &amp;amp; celebrate the diversity in the divine.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

There are other less frequent ones like agni rakShohan, agni anIkavat &amp;amp; the like.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is a certain theological complementarity between jAtavedas &amp;amp; vaishvAnara. agni jAtavedas is identified by the fire established at the beginning of the ritual burning unbroken through it. In the same sense he is also identified with the agni maintained through the generations by the ritualists &amp;ndash; an old IE tradition. Hence, one may interpret jAtavedas as both: he with knowledge of the birth of the ritual in the proximal sense &amp;amp; he with knowledge of it in the sense of continuity from the primordial making of the fire.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A Nepalian image of kAlachakra and vishvamAtA. While the emanation of the primordial cosmic buddha, the two deities were modeled after the shaiva bhairava-bhairavI-yAmala. The kAlachakra tantra, promulgating their worship, was the last great bauddha tantra to be composed (=revealed for insiders) in India. It is believed to have been composed in ~1000s-1100s as the ravages of the Meccan demons, which it records, started unfolding in the north of the subcontinent. As the well of the bauddha-mata was being defiled in the subcontinent (to paraphrase Andre Wink) and its vast Central Asian lands were falling to the tAyin-s or mlechCha-s, it was a religion in crisis (especially its vajrayANa stream).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

There was a parallel occurrence in the early kaumAra tradition, which was likely found in the root ShaNmukha-kalpa. That appears to have been transmitted with some usual modifications to the bauddha-s and preserved in their kriyA-tantra, the siddhaikavIra:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;OM chaturbhuja ShaNmukha vikR^itAnana karNapishAchIm AkarShaya hUM phaT |&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The bhArgava uttered an incantation termed prajananI. As a result a dreadful kR^ityA emerged and rushed at kumAra. Seeing him her motherly instincts were aroused and she started secreting milk from giant mammary glands. Seeing her with kumAra the kR^ittikA-s gathered started hurling swear-words &amp;ldquo;gAlidAna&amp;rdquo; and clapping shouting the word holA holA.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Mom says she heard from her granny that when she was a kid, the stone was found on a tree, it has been there ever since.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The once vigorous lankan flavor of the Hindu tradition had several rituals with deshIya liturgies which were marginalized or exterminated relatively recently by the resurgent sthaviravAdin-s of the shAkyamata.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some examples included the extensive &lt;em&gt;sekra-geDi-shAntiya&lt;/em&gt;, an aindra ritual. One major center of his ritual was Padeniya in lankA where a temple housed his image. Now believed to have been absorbed into the saugata vihAra where the idol is still apparently there. He is said to have sent viShNu to aid the vijayan colonization of lankA from India &amp;amp; along with viShNu and rudra invented the brAhmI script for the lankans to write and wrote out the word svasti as an illustration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The marUnmatta al-shahrastAnI, an adherent of the founder of the Assassins, Hasan bin sabbAh ironically recorded a fragment of a lost Iranic puruSha-sUkta-like origin mythology, where ahura mazdhA speaks in 1st person.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;ahura mazdA:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I created the whole of this world from myself.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;I created the souls of the righteous from the hair of my head;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;the sky from my brain; nails and arms &amp;hellip;(?) from my forehead;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;the sun from my eye;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;the moon from my nose;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;the stars from my tongue;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;sraosha &amp;amp;the rest of&#xA;the yazata-s from my ear;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;the earth from the sinew of my foot.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;~based on Shaked.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Arsuz stele with a Luwian hieroglypic inscription showing the horned god associated with thunder holding a trident. He&amp;rsquo;s possibly followed by the god associated with grain. His name remains unknown as only the hieroglyph is known. Given that Luwian is IE he was probably a deity of the indra-class whose name is believed to be Tarhunz. The Luwians, like the Iranians, adopted the winged disc symbol (above the deity). In another stele, he is shown riding a bull, like the cognate Hittite god &amp;amp; like indra he fights a anti-god like ahi.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The vA~Nga cult of manasA has many unusual features not seen in the south. It is also rather unusual that she rose to be one of the most celebrated goddesses of the region. Some of those include:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Her identification with an ancient goddess padmAvatI (shown with a snake in jina tradition.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol start=&#34;2&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Her rivalry with the goddess chaNDikA who blinds one of her eyes.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol start=&#34;3&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Her unusual companion netA the laundrywoman of the deva-s.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol start=&#34;4&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Her rise to prominence involving the forcible conversion of a v3 of gAndhin (perfumer seller; like MKG) caste.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol start=&#34;5&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Her role in reviving rudra after he drink viSha during the churning of the ocean. 6) Having a head like Channa fish.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol start=&#34;7&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A late element of the vernacular ma&lt;del&gt;Ngala-kAvya-s of the vA&lt;/del&gt;Nga-s: the subjugation of predatory Mohd sardar-s by manasA who sends a great horde of venomous animals to slaughter their forces and sweep them from their territories when the tried to suppress H worship.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A body similar to the ma&lt;del&gt;NgalakAvya-s is not available in the South Indian version of her cult. The Panjabi version is all but forgotten and reduced to obscure temples. My sources of folklorists&#xA;have not supplied anything as detailed as the vA&lt;/del&gt;Nga versions for the andhra or karNATa forms of the cult. Yet one wonders if her initial spread was related to the rise of the chAlukya karNATa empire.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The other sounds are conscious too just as a stone or dead wood is conscious but they are almost entirely of the guNa tamas.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Later, YHWH seemed to take on the attributes of the Levantine kingly weather god, which was His main profile during the early Judahite monarchy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The nine sAttvata-s of the sAttvata-manDala of the pa~ncharAtra are: vAsudeva, balabhadra, pradyumna, sAtyakI, akrUra, aniruddha, gada, sAmba and nishaTha. An andhra mantravAdin replaced akrUra with kR^itavarman in his performance of the yAga.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, a distinct &amp;ldquo;vaiShNava&amp;rdquo; as opposed to &amp;ldquo;sAttvata&amp;rdquo; tradition present a concept of navavyUha, navanAyaka-s or navamUrti. There are are 1. vAsudeva; 2. saMkarShaNa; 3.pradyumna; 4. aniruddha; 5. nArAyaNa; 6. brahman; 7. viShNu; 8. varAha; 9. nR^isiMha. Some mantravAdin-s substitute hayagrIva for brahman. This 9 fold form appears to be a parallel of the shaiva navAtman-bhairava. The first 5 of these in one lineage is termed the pa&lt;del&gt;nchamUrti: saiddhAntika shaiva-s adopt this for their worship of viShNu within the maNDala of sadAshiva. In another lineage, the last 5 might be seen as the deities of the vaiShNava-pa&lt;/del&gt;nchabrahma-mantra-s.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

However, the links to the protogonic deity on the Indo-Aryan side are seen in the form of the two halves of the egg shells on which he is standing &amp;ndash; the hiraNyagarbha: e.g:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It is pollinated by dipterans and lepidopterans, most of them nocturnal, and its pollination coincides with the full moon of July. This may be adaptive in two ways. Many nocturnal insects navigate using the moon. Further, the spectacular reflection of the full-moonlight in the pollination drops is the only apparent means of nocturnal attraction of insects in these plants.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Like breathing. In the delightful world of such rustic slurs, Moodevi is a unique absorbent in the sense that you can pretty much assign it any derogatory connotation and it will be understood as such by both the giver and the recipient. As its suffix implies, it is the exclusive property of the female, and can mean anything from “dumb-wit,” “stupid,” “fool,” “incompetent,” “loose-tongued,” “contemptuous,” and “immoral.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Polytheism is the art of discovering divine multiplicity &amp;amp; is perfectly compatible with monism, pantheism, panentheism, henotheism &amp;amp; even monolatry in some forms. - GA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Gods are multiple (whether or not they arose from a single being before time). This is clear from the experience they granted to our ancestors the Arya-s - with different names, lores and rituals. There is no good reason to reduce them to &amp;ldquo;angels&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;demigods&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;facets&amp;rdquo; of the same entity - it suffices to acknowledge their &lt;a href=&#34;../generality&#34;&gt;generality&lt;/a&gt; and the provisional nature of their &lt;a href=&#34;../myth&#34;&gt;myths&lt;/a&gt;. They may even be innumerable - with more Gods revealing themselves to us under changing spatio-temporal and social circumstances. Tradition holds that their number is large in comparison to everyday numbers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The hard &amp;ldquo;good vs evil&amp;rdquo; dichotomy is absent in the hindu milieu. Rather, there is the &amp;ldquo;higher&amp;rdquo; vs &amp;ldquo;lower&amp;rdquo; gradation.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Yet, Hindu tradition is quite clear in Astika traditions being &amp;ldquo;higher&amp;rdquo; - eg. shatravo anindrA in shruti [&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/blog_supplement/status/777684561954242572&#34;&gt;MT16&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;There is no hard &amp;ldquo;good vs evil&amp;rdquo; dualism seen in dichotomoies such as:&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;the semitic God vs Devil.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Zoroastrian ahura mAzDa vs anghri mainyu or asura-adorers vs deva-adorers.&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;daeva-s and asura-s came from the same pantheon. But - &amp;ldquo;Some deities have been sharply bifurcated. For instance: indra. indra as such is a despised &amp;ldquo;daeva&amp;rdquo; while verethragna (vRtrAghna/vRtrahan, an epithet of indra) is a revered yazata.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;asura-s-raxasa-s&#34;&gt;asura-s, rAxasa-s&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Texts mention asura-s (including daitya-s like hiraNyakashipu and bali, dAnava-s like maya) and rAxasa-s (like rAvaNa)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;asura is used as an apithet of varuNa, rudra and, wait, indra himself in the Rgveda&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;one of the classic (but obscure to modern hindu) synonyms for asura-s is &amp;ldquo;पूर्वदेव&amp;rdquo; (= former deva-s, now fallen into a corrupt station)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Stories of asura-deva-battles are not to be taken literally, according to the veda-s themselves (eg: &lt;a href=&#34;https://vishvAsa.github.io/devaH/vedAH_yajuH/vAjasaneyam/mAdhyandinam/shatapatha-brAhmaNam/sarva-prastutiH/11/01/6/&#34;&gt;shatapatha-brAhmaNa asura-parAbhava part in 11.1.6.8-10&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://vishvAsa.github.io/devaH/vedAH_yajuH/vAjasaneyam/mAdhyandinam/shatapatha-brAhmaNam/eggeling/11/01/6/&#34;&gt;eggling&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;adoration&#34;&gt;Adoration&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Even many demons are ultimately redeemable (often at the cost of being terminated by a deva)!&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Aspects of asura-s, rAkShasa-s etc.. are adored, without rejecting the deva-s (who are presumed to be at the top anyway).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;niRRti is the dikpAla of the South West.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Many are the oblations to various bhUta-s. Then there are oblations to pUtana etc.. during the jAtakarma ritual&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;mahiShAsura is adored, having been syncretized with mhasoba (&lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2003/08/30/kasar-gavlis/&#34;&gt;MT&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/blog_supplement/status/703648579211149312&#34;&gt;MT_TW&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Despite their many bad qualities, rAvaNa (and several rAkShasa-s) had many great qualities - devotion, ability to do great penance, vigor etc.. All this is acknowledged. In fact, rAvaNa too is adored as a minor deity in certain shaiva systems.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;distinctions&#34;&gt;Distinctions&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;In several works, the distinction between asura-s and rAxasa-s is clear.&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;rAmAyaNa &lt;a href=&#34;https://imgur.com/BTgmS4S&#34;&gt;IMG&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;amarakosha&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;असुरा दैत्यदैतेयदनुजेन्द्रारिदानवाः। शुक्रशिष्या दितिसुताः पूर्वदेवाः सुरद्विषः॥&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;राक्षसः कौणपः क्रव्यात्क्रव्यादोऽस्रप आशरः॥&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;asura and rAxasa-s don&amp;rsquo;t seem functionally different. We have a vRtra juxtaposed with a rAvaNa, a prahlAda juxtaposed with vibhIShaNa. Some asura-s and some rAxasa-s are venerated.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;subversive-use&#34;&gt;Subversive use&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;In modern times, people have used this absence of dichotomy to subvert hindus.&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;JNU fiction about the &amp;ldquo;asur&amp;rdquo; tribe and durga: &lt;a href=&#34;https://trueindology.wordpress.com/2016/02/27/jnu-and-the-saga-of-calumny/&#34;&gt;TI16&lt;/a&gt;. However, their clear anti-hindu antecedents make it easy for orthodox hindu-s to avoid confusion [&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/GhorAngirasa/status/703922268376846336&#34;&gt;TW16&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Thread by @EPButler on Thread Reader App – Thread Reader App&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;nudity-of-aphrodite-hathor-bes-bat&#34;&gt;Nudity of Aphrodite, Hathor, Bes, Bat&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The nudity of Aphrodite is comparable to the frontality of depictions of Hathor, atypical for Egyptian Gods, the significance of which is likely the immediacy of Their manifestation, both being associated with beauty and pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hathor shares Her frontality with Bes, who is closely linked to Her in the Returning Goddess rites. (The image of Bes on the left comes from the great temple of Hathor at Dendera.) Hathor inherits Her frontal iconography from Bat, who we see in a Predynastic depiction at right. The name Bat (bA.t) seems to have the sense of &amp;ldquo;the one who is manifest&amp;rdquo;, supporting the idea that frontality symbolizes immediacy. Similarly, Bes delights the Returning Goddess, bringing Her to presence among Her people in festivals of inebriation and other pleasures.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

(Eminence here does not refer simply to superiority in nobility, goodness, or meritoriousness. Evil or queer things, if they are extraordinarily awe-inspiring, are also called kami.)

It also discusses theories of omnipresence that do not think of God as occupying a space as well as &amp;ldquo;occupation theories&amp;rdquo;. In discussing the latter, HH refers to Josh Parsons&amp;rsquo; discussion of relations and location.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He also identifies and discusses six puzzles connected with occupation theories:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Demeter is so alarmed by her appearance that she flees from her without suckling her. However, Demeter later takes her back to her house and hands over the overladyship of the goddesses to Kore.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

(&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/granirau/status/1689099342118793216&#34;&gt;granirau&lt;/a&gt; )&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;daoist-trouble&#34;&gt;Daoist trouble&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A case in point is the situation of folkish Daoism in Sim̐hapurī (Daoism has a remarkably sophisticated cosmology, metaphysics &amp;amp; ritual but the way it is articulated &amp;amp; experienced in SG is what matters) vs that of Buddhism. Among all non-Abrahamic religions, in a very materialistic &amp;amp; increasingly “godless” generation of Chinese youth, Daoism as it is currently practiced - Stands zero chance of survival unless it attempts something drastic. Buddhism’s far more robust ability to provide “sophisticated” answers to “serious questions” leaves it in a far better place in a spiritually hostile climate.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

So if you worship Amadioha unironically in 2024, I&amp;rsquo;ll tell you for free that the Amadioha you think you&amp;rsquo;re worshiping is not the same one your fathers did.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

These Hindus are not even aware of the proper meaning of this word. Monotheism does not mean that you worship one God (already requiring a serious reinterpretation of the many Gods effectively worshipped by most Hindus, from the Vedic rishis on down), the way some Hindus choose one God to worship from among many, a phenomenon that scholars of religion call henotheism. Nor is it the inclusive oneness of a divine essence underlying all the gods, or monism, as enunciated in the profoundest Vedic verses. It means an exclusive worship of a jealous God banishing all others. Mono- does not mean “one”, as Hindus seem to think; it means “alone”, hence “not tolerating another”. It does not say: “Allah and Shiva are one”, it says: “Only Allah is true, burn Shiva.” So far, there is no such jealous God in Dharma.&amp;rdquo; [Koenraad Elst &lt;a href=&#34;http://koenraadelst.blogspot.in/2015/02/down-with-decolonization.html&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;shrauta (eg. soma sacrifices) and gRhya rites (eg. vaishvadeva, sthAlIpAka) routinely include offerings for indra.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A thrill is felt by anyone of the thousands (and more in past times) who routinely chant the Rks or sing the sAmans dedicated to Indra (with even a little understanding).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;kAvyakaNTha-gaNapati-muni even composed an indra-sahasra-nAma-stotra - &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MF0EMbF2XI&#34;&gt;YT&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It almost feels like a conspiracy was made to weaken the Aryans by villainizing Indra Dev in texts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Of the sixty daughters of the prajāpati by his wife Asiknī, ten were married by Dharmadeva; The viśvadevas were the sons of Dharmadeva by his wife viśvā and the Sādhyas were his sons by sādhyā.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The ritual is said to involve pratiShTha of an image of a nAga followed by the ritual performed by a vidyAdhara for weather control - rain or its modulation in case of an excess.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

In the Vedic texts, we see remnants of what might have been an ancient tripartition of this deity, as manifest on the earth, in the atmosphere and in the heavens.+++(5)+++&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;In the first realm, he is manifest as a warrior who inspires men in battle and comes to the aid of his ārya worshipers who offer him rituals: in this form he is typically called Indra or Maghavan or Vṛtrahan.+++(4)+++&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;In his atmospheric form, he is Parjanya, who abundantly pours down life-giving rain.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;In his celestial manifestation, in the high heavens, he is Dyaus.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Already in the Ṛgveda, the earliest surviving Indo-Aryan text, under the name Indra, he comprehensively encompasses all three functions. Yet, the old memory of tripartition, still seen as both Parjanya and Dyaus are retained as distinct devatā-s with specific functions in the atmospheric and celestial domains. By the time of the Mahābhārata, Parjanya has already mostly merged into Indra and lost his distinctness and Dyaus is only faintly remembered within the ogdoad of Vasu-s [incarnated on earth as the pitāmaha Bhīṣma].+++(4)+++&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Evidently the association has many strands and how all of them came together remains unclear. There is the tale of reNukA&amp;rsquo;s adultery (covered here:  &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2006/03/06/the-death-of-renuka/&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;). 1 persistent narrative is that she obtained the cures of for various poxes and herpes after being banished by j for the adultery from the ashvin-s. She then returned to j with her blemishes cleared with these cures. Now yellamma appears to have been a folk goddess of the poxes. That seems to have been fused with reNukA and mixed with the adultery and beheading tales.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This is the final state for all of those beings who are irreversibly on the path to mukti. Yes, we can attain it too. And we attain it by the grace of &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; Śiva&amp;hellip; As mahāmuni sadyojyoti makes it clear, the soul is essentially sarvavyāpī. As far as I understand, aṇutvam is experienced due to mala.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip; In any case, ananta is bound to get liberated with all other vidyeśvaras at the end of mahāpralaya. And since universes are created &amp;amp; dissolved beginninglessly, mahāpralayas too have been occurring eternally. Now this leads to the last conclusion. So, not only an eternal divine multiplicity is necessitated by the sheer nature of reality but the siddhānta now goes one step further &amp;amp; necessitates an infinite pool of Śivas coexisting with &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; Śiva since eternity, who are taught to be equal to him &amp;amp; lordless like him.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

First by prajApati and then by aupanishadic brahman.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In brAhmaNas, prajApati is the creator of devas, time entity, year and yajña. He feeds indra like a mother feeds a child (panchavimsha of samaveda) and other ākhyānas.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In kenopanishad, brahman bests the important devas - agni couldn&amp;rsquo;t burn a grass, vAyu couldn&amp;rsquo;t lift it and indra came closest to the brahman in the form of yaksha. Also in taittiriyopanishad &amp;ldquo;bhIShAsmAd vAtaH pavate&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;, found in kAThaka too - through the fear of brahman wind - &amp;ldquo;Through the fear of him, indra and agni etc.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

He is the Rudra you see in Purāṇa stories &amp;amp; is distinct from Paramaśiva, who operates through Śrīkaṇṭharudra in this world for the sake of bonded souls like us.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Those who have read my tweets regarding the distinction between Paramaśiva &amp;amp; Śrīkaṇṭha will know that I always attribute the literal acts to Śrīkaṇṭha &amp;amp; never Paramaśiva. This is not spelt out as a principle in Siddhānta texts but I had surmised from my reading of the same. I was pleasantly surprised to come across some Ślokas in the Śivapurāṇa which corroborate the same idea. Best part is that I wasn’t remotely looking for such verses. The Ślokas are given in the next tweet.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Why is the Vigraha like this ? There is a history behind it. During the time of Thirumalai Nayakar (1649) who was ruling Madurai, the European powers of Dutch &amp;amp; Portuguese were fighting for a foothold here. Portuguese had a base in Tuticorin, Dutch landed in nearby Tiruchendur &amp;amp; a battle took place between them. After it was won by Dutch, they occupied Tiruchendur temple &amp;amp; made it as their base. Now this has completely put the temple in disarray.&#xA;Image&#xA;The devotees complained to Thirumalai Nayak who had asked the Dutch forces to leave, but they refused. Nayakar sent a small army to remove them from the temple. In that conflict, few Dutch soldiers lost their lives. With no compensation provided by Nayakar for their losses, the Dutch looted the temple and ran with the Shanmuga &amp;amp; Nataraja vigrahas thinking that they were made up of Gold.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

A skilful theologian can easily explain how Karuppaṇasvāmī has evolved from a fierce, rural deity to a transcendental entity that is related to Śiva (or even Viṣṇu) or the Śaiva doorkeeper Mahākāla, in the same way Vināyakas in certain early texts meant something else. There is a multitude of layers (like in a fruit) or if you want another imagery, a “chain” of beings. The transcendental deity is of course the deepest &amp;amp; most hidden. But that doesn’t mean he is unrelated to the more “outer”, “primal” or “rustic” layers that our ancestors first experienced. There is an obvious link between these beings in the hierarchy &amp;amp; it’s not arbitrary. I won’t flesh it out here in full. Just providing a brief sketch.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What does the term tryambaka mean? We hold that it means mother -&amp;gt; goddess. This is supported by the fact the ritual devoted to this form of rudra also invokes the goddess ambA. The ritual sUtra-s mention the 3 rudrian goddess rudrANI, bhavAnI &amp;amp; sharvANI &amp;ndash; pAraskara of SYV tradition. Thus, the form tryambaka is one with the 3 goddesses. The association of rudra with a group of goddesses is also alluded to in the shatarudrIya and the AV texts. Thus, tryambakA means the one with the 3 goddesses. This triadic structure of the rudrian goddesses continued into the tantras with three bhairavI-s of the trika-kaula stream.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

E.g., the use of the chIna characters 双 (shuāng)=double 王 (wáng)=king for yama indicates his ancient twin nature which goes back to the RV.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the Japanese context, this is said to signify yama and yamI who are respectively seen as the lord of the male and the female ghosts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

There is every good reason to believe that there were at least a few Ṛṣis or their peers &amp;amp; contemporaries who may have genuinely seen him as little more than a wrathful deity who punished wrongdoers by going after their cattle or families. There is no need to be delusional about this. There were also Ṛṣis who started getting “hints” as to Rudra’s transcendental nature even in the Ṛgveda. And a few generations after these great pioneers came that supremely inspired Yajurvedīya hymn, the Śatarudriya, which gives us so many insights into the “Higher” Rudra who pervades all beings &amp;amp; yet pleads to Him to avoid our horses, cows &amp;amp; parents. Then you have the Śvetaśvatara. Rudra is practically identified as the supreme cause of causes &amp;amp; you can AirTags see the seeds of later, highly complex Śaiva metaphysical thought and still we have a prayer to Rudra to not harm our loved ones! Then came the Itihāsas &amp;amp; earlier layers of Purāṇas, where you can see instances of cattle-hurting Rudra/Mahādeva but more often a Rudra who destroys demons while humbling the deities when he needs to. Then we also see him being the one beyond Puruṣa &amp;amp; Prakṛti. Then you get the Siddhānta Āgamas &amp;amp; that last book of the Śivapurāṇa, the Vāyavīya-Sam̐hitā—These reveal the supreme Śiva, who is so astonishingly flawless &amp;amp; perfect &amp;amp; ever beyond the reach of anger &amp;amp; the repository of grace. He feels happy at the happiness of all creatures like a father does. This reminds you of Rudra of Ṛgveda, who is addressed as Bhuvanasya Pitā. The fear-filled prayers come to an end in the Āgamas. - GA&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I agree with you that bhR^ihatI per se is not a theonym specific to the uShas-es. It is also applied to a distinct goddess sarasvatI. However, the cognate of Brigid does exist in our midst as the great goddess, mother bR^ihaddivA also known as the celestial urvashI &amp;ndash; we make an oblation to her in the patnIsaMyAja of the new/full-moons. It is possible an element of her theonym is laterally applied to both the uShas-es &amp;amp; sarasvatI in their celestial aspect. Her connection to the national goddess aspect is illustrated by the manifestation as urvaShI the mother of the bhArata dynasty. I&amp;rsquo;ve been intending to revisit this issue and write if the gods are favorable.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

However, even in this a key Germanic peculiarity which illuminates the matter is ignored: the unexpected cognancy of hammer the weapon with word for sky Ger Himmel &amp;amp; Nordic himinn. Thus, the hammer itself was seen specifically as a weapon of heaven &amp;ndash; wrapping into it the dimension of the heaven bolt or meteoritic bolide.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

In Zoroastrian branch of the tradition, the deity is the male vanant associated with the star Vega (𝛼 Lyrae).

The drAviDa-stotra to vArAhI you cited from it is indeed clear on this matter. It inheres specifically from the kameshvarI lineage of the traipura system that was particularly strong in the drAviDa country as presented in the lalitopAkhyAna. In that vArAhI &amp;amp; her 1000 pArShadI-s are incorporated independently of the other mAtR^i-s as daNDanAthA or the commander of the armies of kAmeshvarI.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The preferred order is vasu-s, rudra-s, Aditya-s.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is general belief that the vasu-s have a proximal position as the ritual/funerary fire agni &amp;ndash; hence, the nearest ancestor is with them;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;rudra-s are atmospheric in their general stationing. Hence the next closest ancestor is stationed with them.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;The Aditya-s are in the high heavens and thus the farthest ancestor is with them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

MAJMUDĀR&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;aniconic-worship&#34;&gt;Aniconic worship&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The gods of the Ṛgveda, whose number is stated to be thirty-three, were worshipped not in temples but in the open air on a sacrificial ground. When Agni, as Fire before the eye of the worshipper, was prayed to, any definite image was out of question; Of Vāta (wind) poet of the Ṛgveda says: &amp;ldquo;One hears him, roaring, but his form one does not see&amp;rdquo;. The Rgveda does not contain any evidence of iconographic representations of any of the gods.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A rare coin of huviShka-1 showing the Zoroastrian Iranic rudra-class deity tishtrya. For most part for the Eastern Iranic rudra-class deity was the cognate of the old vAyu: vayush uparo kaiiryo: vAyu who acts in the upper realm.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the Zoroastrian counter-religion rudra under the name saurva or aeshma daeva was demonized but the deity class was retained intact (note parallel with ashvin class) &amp;amp; his characteristics transferred to his star - alpha Canis Majoris which was deified as tishtrya.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is customary to invoke &amp;ldquo;lord of obstacles&amp;rdquo; before commencing an auspicious work. The pauranic &amp;ldquo;shuklāmbaradharam vişņum..&amp;rdquo; is popularly used. At a minimum &amp;ldquo;gaņeśāya namaH&amp;rdquo;. It would be interesting to trace the evolution of &amp;ldquo;obstacle removal&amp;rdquo; formulas.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this context, the virūpāksha dantāñji formula from sāmavedic texts is interesting. The mantras as per Chāndogya brāhmaņa as well as jaiminiya gŕhyasūtra are as follows: &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Specially the lines &amp;ldquo;japantam mā mā prati jāpsïh. juhvantam mā mā pratihauşīh. kurvantam mā mā pratikārşīh&amp;rdquo;. When I do japa, do not obstruct my japa. When I make offering, do not obstruct my offering. When I do (sacrificial) act, do not obstruct my action.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It seems, given his name and function, viShvaksena evolved as a vaiShNava reflex of skanda. This is supported by the early kaumAra tradition where he is surrounded by the 4 vinAyaka-s like those companions of viShvaksena. Moreover, skanda played a key role in the creation of vinAyaka(-s) in one of the old traditions preserved in the voluminous skandapurANa. Notably, in a curious twist the shaiva vatulottara names skanda as viShvaksena and vishAkha as jayatsena once in the account of the AvaraNa of rudragaNa-s. An eastern tradition preserved in the merutantra records his worship along with sAtyaki &amp;ndash; probably an inheritance from an old sAttvata tradition which might have even conceived of sAtyaki as his incarnation.+++(5)+++&lt;/p&gt;</description>

He then pleases them with the rahastarpaNa and the rahoyAga. If his rite is successful, he has taken a step on the highest mantramarga*. He who attempts the secret mantra-s without the sign and permission of skanda attains dismal failure.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;yogapitha-kramodaya&#34;&gt;yogapITha-kramodaya&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The yogapITha-kramodaya, one of the earliest surviving yoginI-kaula tantra-s, has an abhichArikA rite, performed in the cemetery, which is related to the terrific essence-sucking yoginI rites of the bhairava-srotas. The center of this yAga of 7 yoginI-s one named kusumamAlinI (= hAkinI based on her mantra). She is surrounded by the six yAkinI, shAkinI, kAkinI, lAkinI, rAkinI and DAkinI (some names corrupted in the Nepalian manuscript). These are none other than the dhAtunAthA-s or the “tissue-yoginI-s” of the dakShiNAmnAya associated with chakra-s of the spinal kula-patha (ekavR^ikSha: suShumNa) and the 7 dhatu-s. These, according to the YPK, corresponding to each of the 7 in the above order, are: semen, bone, connective tissue (sinew), muscle, marrow, blood, and skin. In the rite, they are called upon to afflict the respective tissues of the enemies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

He is believed to be the master of the netherworld with a dog. Note trishUla with likely lunar deity -an iconographic parallel across Eurasia. The Hatra +++(which was)+++ vandalized by the +++(IS)+++ Khilafat few years back.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He appears to have manifested in a benign form above &amp;amp; a fierce form here. The IE influences are clear: the dog; here 3-headed as yavana Kerberos. His axe is again an IE influence. The time deity on the trishUla has both the solar ray &amp;amp; lunar crescent.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

In later texts, he is also called &lt;strong&gt;Caṇḍaroṣaṇa&lt;/strong&gt; (&amp;ldquo;Violent Wrathful One&amp;rdquo;). Acala first appears in Amoghapāśakalparāja Sūtra, translated by Bodhiruci 707-709 CE, where he is described as servant or messenger of buddha Vairocana:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Vedic sense of a~nji has some mystery to it. It has a clear connection to the marut-s.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For e.g. we have in the RV: ye pR^iShatIbhir R^iShTibhiH sAkaM vAshIbhir a~njibhiH | ajAyanta svabhAnavaH || It is normally translated as unguent. In fact has an IE pedigree with that word. However, it is mentioned here with the weapons of the marut-s R^iShTi (spear) and vAshI (battle pickaxe).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here again it is mentioned with the battle axe, armor and gauntlets: ye a&lt;del&gt;njiShu ye vAshIShu svabhAnavaH srakShu rukmeShu khAdiShu | &amp;hellip; The a&lt;/del&gt;nji of the marut-s is also notably said to be brilliant white in color. Some times the word a~nji is also taken to mean brilliant. So it could mean the lighting weapon of the marut-s.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Context is that of the sage vasiSTha invoking the wrath of indrAsomau (indra-soma as a joint deity) against detractors accusing him of being a yAtudhAna (a kind of evil being). The term commonly translated as &amp;ldquo;false gods&amp;rdquo; is the compound word, anRtadeva. What does vasiSTha say here? &amp;ldquo;yadi vAham anRtadevaH&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;. Literally rendered, it goes &amp;ldquo;If I were an anRtadeva&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, it is very important to avoid confusion here. Here, it is important to note that in the original text, there is an accent on the first member, anRta (I&amp;rsquo;m unable to go into details due to lack of time; others may wish to add/clarify) of the compound, anRtadeva. This makes it a bahuvRhi compound, giving the sense &amp;ldquo;he who has anRta as deva&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

In contrast, this thread is an attempt at my reasoning in the form of FAQ.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;problem&#34;&gt;Problem&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;What is the subaqueous fire or &amp;ldquo;fire in the water&amp;rdquo; problem? Rigveda talks about fire that&amp;rsquo;s from waters in numerous instances. &amp;ldquo;apsu antar&amp;rdquo; - inside waters; &amp;ldquo;agnim samudra vāsasam&amp;rdquo; - agni, having ocean as clothes. A conception of fire inside the water is strange and there has to be a reason for this conception. Finding a satisfactory reason for this reason is what I call the &amp;ldquo;fire in water problem&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;explanations&#34;&gt;Explanations&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol start=&#34;2&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;What were the explanations given (Indological or otherwise)?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;psychadelic-trip&#34;&gt;Psychadelic trip&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A. &amp;ldquo;Rigvedic poets were tripping after imbibing psychoactive soma beverage.

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Etymologically, the goddesses of the waters can be understood as Apsaras-es with Urvaśī, Sahajanyā, Ghṛtācī and Menakā at their head (From Rāṣṭrabhṛt-s). Kavi, the son of Bhṛgu: &amp;ldquo;samudriyā apsaraso manīṣiṇam āsīnā antar abhi somam akṣaran |&amp;rdquo;. &amp;ldquo;This identity of the Apsaras-es as the goddesses of the waters is reinforced in the famous ritual of the apsaras-es and the gandharva of the ocean, which we shall perform at a different time. There we shall encounter another dangerous class of 80 Apsaras-es who are known as the Uluṅgulukā-s, coming in groups of 31, 4, 10, 10, 25, associated with the asura Uluṅgula.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the correct answer with two further Kashmirian exemplars of the same deity. The one I posted is to my knowledge the 3rd surviving exemplar. The deity is amR^iteshvara-bhairava whose vidyA is taught in the netra-tantra which has a masterly commentary by the Kashmirian mantravAdin kShemarAja, a cousin and student of abhinavagupta.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The consort of the deity is amR^italakShmI or amR^iteshvarI. At one point in time the deity was widely worshipped throughout the Indosphere. It is not commonly known that the so-called mahAlakShmI at Kolhapur in Mh was actually amR^italakShmI worshipped along with the amR^iteshvara-bhairava who was installed in the nearby mahAshmashAna. This is confirmed in the inscription of bhoja-shilahara.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;कमलजदयिताष्टकम्  (शिवाभिनवनृइसिंहभारतीविरचितम्)&lt;br&gt;&#xA;॥ श्री गुरुभ्यो नमः॥&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;विस्तारः (द्रष्टुं नोद्यम्)&lt;/summary&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The prayer is addressed address to Sarasvati Devi -  कमलजदयिता  - the beloved (  दयिता  ) of Brahmaji kamalaja: The Lotus Born. (From Vishnu&amp;rsquo;s navel, a lotus appeared and on that lotus appeared  चतुर्मुख-ब्रह्मा  ) . The author addresses Sarasvati Devi as  कमलज-दयिता  and prays to her so that he can successfully tread the spiritual path and attain liberation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After having been blessed by Devi with the qualifications as asked for in the above verses, the Acharya is ready now for Jnana Yoga in the form of  श्रवणम्  - listening to Vedanta / Upanishad Shastra from a Guru,  मननम्  - reflecting and clearing doubts to get conviction and  निदिध्यासनम्  - meditating on the words of Upanishad Shastra for internal assimilation of the message and to get out of habitual notion that I am this body. Jnana Yoga is analysis of vedantic scriptures to know my Real nature i.e.  सत् चित् आत्मा  - which is the unobjectifiable observer whose nature is pure existence and consciousness. The acharya asks for help in this long drawn process and to get absorbed in His Higher Nature.(The capacity for absorption is a faculty the mind has. In short he is asking - Let me attain&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Moksha through Jnana Yoga.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the archaic skandapurANa the goddess kaushikI daughter of umA and rudra places her various emanations across greater India thus:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;bahuputrikA (a kaumAra goddess) &amp;amp; pralambA  lankA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;lambauShTI, kiMnarI &amp;amp; vR^iShadaMshA in siMhala;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;revatI (a kaumAra goddess) in gokarNa;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;mukhamaNDikA (kaumAra goddess) in pANDya; shivA in AbhIra;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;shAnti in varaNAtaTa;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;prabhA in vatsagulma&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;lakShmI in kollagiri;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;upakA in pArashIka (Iranic land),&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;vAyasI in yavanadesha (Greek land);&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;prachaNDA at tukhArasthAna (Tocharia);&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;lambikA in kausala,&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;jayA+vijayA at svapura (?)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;prabhAvatI in kali~Nga;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;jayantI in hastinApura;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;ShaShThI in kashmIra;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;saramA in malaya;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;pUtanA in suvIra;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;mR^ityu in piShTapura;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;bahumAMsA in koTIvarsha;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;kaTapUtanA in paundravardhana;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;aspR^iShTA in madhyadesha;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;kiMnarI-2 in barbara;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;nirAyAsyA &amp;amp; chitragaNTA in vArANasI;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;mahAkAlI in ujjayinI;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;vAnarI in shabara-desha.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This list of 32 goddesses include kaushikI herself in the vindhya-s is likely the old list of shaktI-pITha-s that later expanded in number. Some of them survive as is to date. Most famous is lakshmI of kollagiri in modern Maharashtra.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

If the letters of each Paadas increase to 27,30,33,36 (other multiples of 3 beyond 27), then this slokam is recognized as a Dhandakam. The 3 lettered units are known as a GaNa. Thus a 27 lettered Paada will have 9 GaNaas.There is generally no restriction on the length of the Paada in a Dhandakam.Swami Desikan chose Paadas with 36 GaNaas or 108 = (32X4) letters for the four Paadas of Garuda Dhandakam. The poetic genius of Swami Desikan is abundantly evident in this Composition. The Paadas of this Dhandakam parsed by its 144 GaNaas make intricate swoops in the air and make sharp turns like the high soaring Pakshi Raja (Garuda).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

For as it turned out, not a single shell fired nor bomb dropped at the Temple had exploded. Literally hundreds of munitions had all somehow either failed to detonate, or had mysteriously flown off-course; with some Pakistani air force personnel reportedly claiming that during their attack-runs, instead of being able to see the Temple … they could only see a small girl sitting beside a lake. … Following the conclusion of the 1965 War with Pakistan, the Indian Border Security Force took over the Temple – they now run it, administer it, and have established a small dedicated base on the grounds.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The non-Zoroastrian Iranic goddess Tabiti likely cognate of Indian tapatI.+++(5)+++ She is the solar goddess daughter of the sun. It is possible that the shaka rulers traced descent from her, such as the shaka ruler shown with the drinking horn in front of her. This legend was likely transmitted to Japan as she was syncretized with Amaterasu &amp;amp; the same legend adopted as the found myth of the Japanese emperors.+++(5)+++&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Because it is elusive and suggestive rather than  directly narrative, it has given rise to a wide variety of interpretations. The interpre tation we offer here follows the more extensive discussion in Brereton (1999), which  also refers to earlier literature and alternate interpretations.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;If this is a cosmogonic hymn, it is certainly a strange one, because the last verse  does not come to a conclusion but ends with a question. This incompleteness is  formally marked by both metrical and syntactic irregularities. The meter of verse  7b is two syllables short, leaving the its hearers to anticipate two beats that are not  there, and the syntax of 7d is incomplete since the poem ends with a relative clause  without a main clause. A close look at the rest of the hymn explains the reason for  these poetic strategies.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;In verse 1 there is a progression from negations—what existed was neither exist ing nor nonexisting and neither space nor heaven existed—to questions (1c) to  possibilities (1d). Verse 2 also begins with negation, here the negation of death,  deathlessness, and the signs of night and day. The only narrative progress is the  greater specificity in verse 2 about what is negated: there are no mortals or immor tals, there is no moon or sun. But whereas 1cd continued with questions and pos sibilities, 2cd provides an answer to the question of what existed: there existed “that  One,” which “breathed without wind.” In 1c the poet asked what “stirred,” or more  literally what “moved back and forth,” and in 2c the implicit answer is that the  “breathing” of the One moves back and forth. If 2c answers the question of 1c and  indeed if verse 2 defines what verse 1 suggests, then “that One” in verse 2 is the pre viously undefined thing that was neither existent nor nonexistent in verse 1.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Verse 3 sharpens the sense that nothing is happening, nothing material at least. It  apparently starts over once again: 3a ends “in the beginning” (ágre) just as 1a ends&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1585831325948252162.html&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;नील॑शिखण्ड॒ वा ह॑नः ।&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The AV mantra nIlashikaNDavAhanaH is used in kaumAra parlance as the renowned aShTAkShari-vidyA. The word nIlashikhaNDa is a unique usage of the AV tradition that is not &lt;em&gt;endogenous&lt;/em&gt; to the RV, YV or SV. It likely emerged as a term in the Indo-Iranian border zone where the core of AV tradition developed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is specifically applied to rudra or his ectypes bhava &amp;amp; sharva which some traditions see as his twin sons ~ ashvin-s of the RV. The AV usage likely parallels the nilagrIva of the YV tradition that became dominant in the later H tradition. AV-vulgate 6.93.1 refers to sharva rather than skanda (yes the 2 are related). The interpretation of AV-vul 20.132 in the vaidika sense goes thus:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

In one place it&amp;rsquo;s said that he should be kept along with skanda flanking the two sides of Rudra. Parama samhita also says that vinAyaka can be worshipped for some particular kAmya karma along with other gods. - shArdUla&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With the rise of the new god vinAyaka, the old vedic deity brAhmaNaspati==bR^ihaspati was identified with him. The expansion of this identity was a medieval phenomenon that developed in the region encompassing the modern Mh-TN states. Several bR^ihaspati mantra-s were now systematically recast and reinterpreted as vinAyaka-mantra-s within this burgeoning gANapatya tradition. This additionally had a symbiotic entwining with the growing shrIkula influence on certain sections of smArta-s and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Their names are provided in the yajur texts as batches of 7 (e.g. KYV-TS 4.6.5).&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Homologs of skanda and mars (etymological similarity too). सादृश्यम् &lt;a href=&#34;MT_lekhAH/2007-07-25_maruts-as-para-skanda-and-other-elements-of-their-mythology/&#34;&gt;अन्यत्रोक्तम्&lt;/a&gt;। वायुतुल्या इति केचिद् अर्वाचीना रामायणादौ।&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;लक-ऽभजञनम&#34;&gt;लोके ऽभिज्ञानम्&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Meteor showers इति RN Iyengar महाशयः &lt;a href=&#34;https://insa.nic.in/writereaddata/UpLoadedFiles/IJHS/Vol45_1_1_RNIyengar.pdf&#34;&gt;अत्र&lt;/a&gt;।&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;चण्डमारुतो वृष्टिसहिता इति सायणादिव्याख्यातारः।&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;अनयजनष&#34;&gt;अन्यजनेषु&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;इरनकष&#34;&gt;इरानिकेषु&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This might also explain&#xA;the “loss of the maruts” in the Iranian line – with the whole-scale&#xA;demonization of the raudra class, their leader saurva-daeva was retained&#xA;as a demon, but the symbolism of the multiplicity of the marut-s was now&#xA;without value to the Iranian. However, the mention of the seven powers&#xA;of aeshma-daeva in the bundahishn is probably not a coincidence and a&#xA;reminiscence derived from the seven-fold marudgaNa-s [Footnote 3].&#xA;Thus, only the essence of the marut-s was abstracted in the form of&#xA;their unique epithet aeshma and retained as yet another daeva. This&#xA;parallels the positive “essentialization” with contraction of the&#xA;marut-s to give rise to the deity skanda.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;वरपकष-दनतञज&#34;&gt;विरूपाक्षो दन्ताञ्जि&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;virūpāksha dantāñji formula from sāmavedic texts is interesting. The mantras as per Chāndogya brāhmaņa as well as jaiminiya gŕhyasūtra - &amp;ldquo;japantam mā mā prati jāpsïh. juhvantam mā mā pratihauşīh. kurvantam mā mā pratkārşīh&amp;rdquo;.&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;In a sāmavedic homa this mantra is uttered just after placing praņītā pot to the north of fire and prastara (darbha bundle) in the south.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Gobhila gŕhya mentions that this formula is muttered before all homas.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It adds a special rule for kāmya sacrifices. The performer does a prāņāyāma - while holding the breath, he mutters the prapada formula (right next to the virupaksha formula).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;dantA~njin should be either interpreted as marked with a tusk or a tusk which is like that special attribute of the marut-s. When breathing out, he mutters the virupaksha formula.   - मरुतां सम्बन्धे वेदेष्व् अञ्जिशब्दः+++(=चिक्कनतयोज्ज्वलम्)+++ &lt;a href=&#34;../../../marutaH/meta/MT_lekhAH/anji-sambandhaH/&#34;&gt;प्रयुज्यते&lt;/a&gt; ।&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Virupaksha most likely is a form of rudra. However he seems to have aspects of time in this mantra. He has 12 sons who year after year sacrifice to him and commence brahmacharya. The 12 sons are 12 months (as per commentator) possibly the equation of samvatsara = yajña is alluded. The mantra says his bed is of leaves. His station is in antariksha with golden shed And iron jar with &amp;lsquo;devānām hŕdaya&amp;quot; - hearts of the Gods. Compare rudrānuvāka - &amp;ldquo;namaH parņāya cha parņashadyāya cha&amp;rdquo;.. &amp;ldquo;devānāM hŕdayebhyo..&amp;rdquo;. Both the leaf motif and &amp;ldquo;hearts of Gods&amp;rdquo; motif present. - कस्तूरिः&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://x.com/i/lists/934873690050740224&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When Indra, angered by the misdeeds of the one who does Vedādhyayana &amp;amp; drinks sura at the same time (Vṛtra), kills him with foam, afraid of the evil, he resorts to Nārāyaṇa. Pleased by his prayers, Nārāyaṇa appears before him &amp;amp; tells him that he should seek Śrīkaṇṭharudra while wearing his (Viṣṇu’s) nārasim̐ha-kavaca. This gives Indra a Nārasim̐ha-rūpa, adorning which he does dhyāna for a 1000 years. At the end of this period, Indra acquires the divine vision of Śrīkaṇṭharudra &amp;amp; the knowledge of Śrīmat-Kāmika from him, which fulfils all his desires.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

These names of Rudra also persist in the ādhvaryava tradition preserved in the Yajurveda-s but the twinning is less prominent relative the AV tradition. Notably, in the celebrated Mṛgāreṣṭi ritual the AV tradition features a sūkta to the twin Bhavā-Śarvā whereas in its place the KYV tradition has ṛk-s to the Aśvin-s. This points to two parallel streams within the early Vedic tradition which featured Rudra in singular form (apart from the plurality of the Rudra-class) as seen in the RV or in twin form of Bhavā-Śarvā as seen in the AV. This suggests that the Rudra-class had an ancient intrinsic twin nature shared with the Aśvin-s which lingers in the Bhavā-Śarvā dyad. Notably, even in Greek tradition the deity of the Rudra-class, Apollo is born with twin (albeit female), Artemis. While the RV Aśvin-s are identical twins in character, sometimes, in the IE world one sees some differentiation of the the twins with one of them associated with healing and animal-husbandry and the other with warfare. For example, among the Yavana-s, one of the pair, Castor is a horse-trainer while the other one Polydeuces is a boxer. A similar differentiation is perhaps reflected in the twin Rudra-s, with the name Bhava indicating welfare and health, and the and Śarva meaning and archer and indicating the warrior nature of the second twin. Thus, it is likely that Bhava and Śarva were part of the parallel Vedic tradition where they played the role of the Aśvin-s as twin Rudra-s.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/blog_supplement/status/1379952671268995073&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Humans were not around from the inception in this universe. In fact they are very recent phenomenon given the age of the universe. The shAstra-s (in the broad sense) have been around for just a subset of that period of human existence. At some point the humans &amp;amp; their shAstra-s will become extinct. Thus, if the devatA-s were dependent on the shAstra-s then their existence will be finite &amp;amp; conterminal with the emergence &amp;amp; extinction of species like humans. This is contradictory with the very account of most devatA-s in a shAstra, be it naigamika or Agamika.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Elsewhere, she is described as pherushatair vR^itA: does this imply the gods took the form of jackals, or is it merely a scribal slip?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;mythemes-antiquity&#34;&gt;Mytheme&amp;rsquo;s antiquity&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This mytheme of the father playing along to lose to his son to enhance his glory is an old IE one. In the foundation of the Olympic games Zeus appears as a wrestler &amp;amp; purposely loses to Herakles to enhance his glory. Similarly, indra loses to arjuna at khANDava in order to enhance his son&amp;rsquo;s glory. Similarly, I suspect that these mytheme has been incorporated in the case of rudra enhancing kumAra.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;अपसमबनध-परचनत-च&#34;&gt;अप्सम्बन्धः, प्राचीनता च&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The river is textually identified with&#xA;the aquatic deity of the Indo-Aryans, sarasvatI who is widely worshiped&#xA;in the R^igveda and persists to this date in the modern Hindu religions&#xA;as a consort of brahmA. &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of the important themes that emerges from the aponaptrIya ritual is&#xA;the intimate connection between sarasvati and Agni as worshipped as the&#xA;son of the waters or apAM napAta. This fiery entity hidden with the&#xA;water is of ancient IE provenance as is evidenced by the word naptha&#xA;meaning a fiery substance and the same time bearing a relationship to&#xA;the word naptar or relative, suggesting that it was essentially derived&#xA;from the ancestral state ApAM napAt. The connection between the water&#xA;deity and apAM napAt (who is described as being surrounded) by water&#xA;nymphs (another ancient IE concept) can be demonstrated in a number of&#xA;IE myths.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Finally, we come to the analogs of the goddess on the Attic amphora. While, the Iranic daenA &amp;amp; Persephone are not exact cognates, they, nevertheless, indicate the presence of a goddess in the passage to the nether realm. Who is their equivalent in the H tradition? Whereas in a functional sense we could say that the hell-goddess nirR^iti overlaps with Persephone the match is not exact &amp;amp; she is never in the &amp;ldquo;picture&amp;rdquo; in this context. Instead, the funerary ritual of Arya-s indicates the equivalent goddess in this context is sarasvatI svadhAvati&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Yet, the RV is quite clear about him not being the same as the sun. The sun is merely one manifestation of his activity. In particular, he is specifically linked to the celestial lights, like the rays of the sun (e.g. RV 1.35.7; 4.14.2; 5.81.4; 10.139.1) +++(It is in this context that the famed Vijayanagaran scholiast Sāyaṇa gives a large value that may be interpreted as the speed of these rays. It notably is comparable to the modern value of $c$.)+++ This relates to his golden color, which is often emphasized. The sage Hiraṇyastūpa Āṅgirasa uses the play on that word hiraṇya (golden) to encode his name in his upamaṇdala.  In RV 1.35.9 he is described as impelling the sun. Thus, he is not just the sun itself but also the force behind the diurnal motion of the sun.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-ritual-of-ācamana&#34;&gt;The ritual of ācamana&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;He sips water 3× with the 3 feet of the Sāvitrī.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Thereafter, he performs mārjanam at the appropriate spots on the face and one shoulder with the feet of the āpohiṣṭhiya mantra-s, at other shoulder with the 7 vyāhṛtis, at the chest with the whole sāvitrī and on the head with the brahmaśiras.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;He may use this ācamana for routine smārta and ekāgni purposes. The only exceptions are Atharvan rituals (where he should use the Atharvavedīya ācamana-vidhi) and the three-fire śrauta rituals.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;saṃdhyopāsanā&#34;&gt;saṃdhyopāsanā&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The Sāvitrī is the essential mantra for the twilight saṃdhyopāsanā or the worship of the god Savitṛ during the day. Every dvija has to receive this mantra from his father or male guardian during his upanayana. If a brāhmaṇa male does not perform this rite at all then the king who observes dharma may employ him a śūdra.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;He should first take a bath if he is an state of impurity before performing the Savitropāsanā. Beyond a bath with water, a dvija should also perform prokṣaṇa.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Having deployed the saṃdhyā preliminaries as ordained in his śruti or that ordained by in the Baudhāyana tradition, he can perform the mantra-practice.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;He does japa (inaudibly) of the Sāvitrī 1008× or 108×.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If he does not have the time he may perform prāṇāyama with the 7 vyāhṛti-s and the brahmaśiras 10×.&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The most simple form of prāṇāyāma involves inhaling with oṃ bhūḥ.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Retaining the breath with the rest of the mantra and exhaling with the brahmaśiras.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;After concluding the japa or prāṇāyāma he offers arghya 3 ×  + 1 for expiation with his cupped palms or a shell.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;He then invokes Mitra (morning) and Varuṇa (evening) or both if he has missed one. Then he utters the purificatory incantation of Agni, Sūrya or the waters.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;purification&#34;&gt;Purification&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If a dvija has committed a ghora-pāpa, e.g. abortion, brāhmaṇī-gamanam, puṃścalī-gamanam etc, or has killed a dog, a beaver, a mongoose, a goose or a garden lizard, then he may purify himself after reciting the Sāvitrī 8000× continuously starting before the sun rises.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If a dvija has had his bath but is uncertain of his ritual purity due to activities he has performed since his bath, he may wear new clothes and perform a japa of the Sāvitrī for a fixed number of times or do prāṇāyāma as described above.&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Then he recites the following incantation of Vasiṣṭha:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;शुची॑ वो ह॒व्या म॑रुतः॒ शुची॑नां॒&lt;br&gt;&#xA;शुचिं॑ हिनोम्य् अध्व॒रं शुचि॑भ्यः ।&lt;br&gt;&#xA;ऋ॒तेन॑ स॒त्यम् ऋ॑त॒साप॑ आय॒ञ्&lt;br&gt;&#xA;छुचि॑-जन्मानः॒ शुच॑यः पाव॒काः ॥&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Pure oblations to you O Marut-s, the pure ones;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;A pure ritual I offer to the pure ones;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;By the ṛta the ṛta-knowers have attained truth,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;of pure birth, they who are pure, the purifiers.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;concluding-ritual&#34;&gt;Concluding ritual&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;After the conclusion of upāsanā the ritualist must invoke Savitṛ for protection. He sprinkles water on the place where he did is upāsanā and having touched the ground with his ring finger, he touches the spot between his eyebrows with the same finger. While doing this action he recites the following Sāvitra incantations of Śyāvāśva Ātreya:&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;अ॒द्या नो॑ देव सवितः&lt;br&gt;&#xA;प्र॒जाव॑त् सावीः॒ सौभ॑गम् ।&lt;br&gt;&#xA;परा॑ दु॒ष्ष्वप्न्यं॑ सुव ॥&lt;br&gt;&#xA;विश्वा॑नि देव सवितर्&lt;br&gt;&#xA;दुरि॒तानि॒ परा॑ सुव ।&lt;br&gt;&#xA;यद् भ॒द्रं तन् न॒ आ सु॑व ॥&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;७२ मन्त्राः। एते बोधायनैः स्मृताः (&amp;ldquo;Baudhāyana Dharmasūtra 4, 7, 7. Taitt. Br. 2, 7, 7 differs.&amp;rdquo; इति Aufrecht) - सिंहानुवाकस्य पर्यायः।&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;details&gt;&lt;summary&gt;विनियोगः&lt;/summary&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is advised to chant these mantras, while looking at yourself in a pot of water, and finally empty the water in nirritti dik.  All types of negative aspects of our personality will get destroyed. The prayoga also says that those who do not perform  vaishvadeva could also recite these mantras before lunch to get the benefits.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
