      <description>Terms here.  Ecliptic      
  Sun is always at 0 deg latitude. It&#39;s longitude (determinable using background stars) is 0 deg (=0 RA) during march vernal equinox, 90 deg (= 6h RA) during summer solstice, 270 (= 18h RA) during winter solstice etc..
  Latitudes are parallel to each other, longitudes pass through the same two poles.
  The 0 deg and 180 deg longitude together form the equinotical colure.</description>

      <description>Motivation There was a long discussion about the following brAhmaNa of the taittirIyakas- तैत्तिरीयब्राह्मणे ऽत्र।.
The classical commentators (as well as modern shrauta and smArta ritualists familiar with ancient and modern astronomy I checked with) clearly require measurement of the time required by the sun to &amp;ldquo;reach&amp;rdquo; a certain point &amp;ldquo;behind&amp;rdquo; the position of a desired naxatra at sunrise. Of course, this means reaching a certain point on the sun’s daily path, [let’s say that it lies in something called the Diurnal circle (defined below)], which is comparable (say in altitude or proximity) to the point where the nakShatra was last seen.</description>
