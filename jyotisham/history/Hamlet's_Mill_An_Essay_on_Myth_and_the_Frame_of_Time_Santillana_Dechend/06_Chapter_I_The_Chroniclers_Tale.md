T 

Xhe proper gate through which to enter the realm of pre- 
Shakespearean Hamlet is the artless account given by Saxo Gram¬ 
maticus (c. 1150-c. 1216) in books III and IV of his Gesta Dano- 
rum. What follows is the relevant part of book III in Elton’s 
translation, only slightly shortened. 

The story begins with the feats of Orvendel, Amlethus’ father— 
especially his victory over King Koll of Norway—which drove 
Orvendel’s brother Fengo, “stung with jealousy,” to murder him 
(appendix #2). “Then he took the wife of the brother he had 
butchered, capping unnatural murder with incest.” (So Saxo 
qualifies it.) 

Amleth beheld all this, but feared lest too shrewd a behaviour 
might make his uncle suspect him. So he chose to feign dullness, and 
pretend an utter lack of wits. This cunning course not only con¬ 
cealed his intelligence, but ensured his safety. Every day he remained 
in his mother’s house utterly listless and unclean, flinging himself on 
the ground and bespattering his person with foul and filthy dirt. His

discoloured face and visage smutched with slime denoted foolish and 
grotesque madness. All he said was of a piece with these follies; all 
he did savoured of utter lethargy . . . 

He used at times to sit over the fire, and, raking up the embers with 
his hands, to fashion wooden crooks, and harden them in the fire, 
shaping at their tips certain barbs, to make them hold more tightly 
to their fastenings. When asked what he was about, he said that he 
was preparing sharp javelins to avenge his father. This answer was 
not a little scoffed at, all men deriding his idle and ridiculous pursuit; 
but the thing helped his purpose afterwards. Now it was his craft in 
this matter that first awakened in the deeper observers a suspicion of 
his cunning. For his skill in a trifling art betokened the hidden talent 
of a craftsman . . . Lastly, he always watched with the most punctual 
care over his pile of stakes that he had pointed in the fire. Some 
people, therefore, declared that his mind was quick enough, and fan¬ 
cied that he only played the simpleton . . . His wiliness (said these) 
would be most readily detected, if a fair woman were put in his way 
in some secluded place, who should provoke his mind to the tempta¬ 
tions of love . . . , if his lethargy were feigned, he would seize the 
opportunity, and yield straightway to violent delights. 

So men were commissioned to draw the young man in his rides into 
a remote part of the forest, and there assail him with a temptation of 
this nature. Among these chanced to be a foster-brother of Amleth, 
who had not ceased to have regard to their common nurture . . . He 
attended Amleth among his appointed train . . . and was persuaded 
that he would suffer the worst if he showed the slightest glimpse of 
sound reason, and above all if he did the act of love openly. This was 
also plain enough to Amleth himself. For when he was bidden mount 
his horse, he deliberately set himself in such a fashion that he turned 
his back to the neck and faced about, fronting the tail; which he pro¬ 
ceeded to encompass with the reins, just as if on that side he would 
check the horse in its furious pace . . . The reinless steed galloping 
on, with the rider directing its tail, was ludicrous enough to behold. 

Amleth went on, and a wolf crossed his path amid the thicket; when 
his companions told him that a young colt had met him, he retorted 
that in Fengo’s stud there were too few of that kind fighting. This 
was a gentle but witty fashion of invoking a curse upon his uncle’s 
riches. When they averred that he had given a cunning answer, he 
answered that he had spoken deliberately: for he was loth to be 
thought prone to lying about any matter, and wished to be held a 
stranger to falsehood; and accordingly he mingled craft and candour 
in such wise that, though his words did lack truth, yet there was 
nothing to betoken the truth and betray how far his keenness went. 






Hamlet’s Mill • 14 

Again, as he passed along the beach, his companions found the rud¬ 
der 1 of a ship which had been wrecked, and said they had discov¬ 
ered a huge knife. “This,” said he, “was the right thing to carve such 
a huge ham”; by which he really meant the sea, to whose infinitude, 
he thought, this enormous rudder matched. 

Also, as they passed the sandhills, and bade him look at the meal, 
meaning the sand, he replied that it had been ground small by the 
hoary tempests of the ocean. His companions praising his answer, he 
said that he had spoken wittingly. Then they purposely left him, that 
he might pluck up more courage to practice wantonness. 

The woman whom his uncle had dispatched met him in a dark spot, 
as though she had crossed him by chance; and he took her and would 
have ravished her, had not his foster-brother, by a secret device, given 
him an inkling of the trap . . . Alarmed, and fain to possess his desire 
in greater safety, he caught up the woman in his arms and dragged 
her off to a distant and impenetrable fen. Moreover, when they had 
lain together, he conjured her earnestly to disclose the matter to none, 
and the promise of silence was accorded as heartily as it was asked. 
For both of them had been under the same fostering in their child¬ 
hood; and this early rearing in common had brought Amleth and the 
girl into great intimacy. 

So, when he had returned home, they all jeeringly asked him whether 
he had given way to love, and he avowed that he had ravished the 
maid. When he was next asked where he did it, and what had been 
his pillow, he said that he had rested upon the hoof of a beast of 
burden, upon a cockscomb, and also upon a ceiling. For, when he was 
starting into temptation, he had gathered fragments of all these things, 
in order to avoid lying . . . 

The maiden, too, when questioned on the matter, declared that he 
had done no such thing; and her denial was the more readily credited 
when it was found that the escort had not witnessed the deed. 

But a friend of Fengo, gifted more with assurance than judgment, 
declared that the unfathomable cunning of such a mind could not be 
detected by a vulgar plot, for the man’s obstinacy was so great that 
it ought not to be assailed with any mild measures . . . Accordingly, 
said he, his own profounder acuteness had hit on a more delicate way, 
which was well fitted to be put in practice, and would effectually 
discover what they desired to know. Fengo was purposely to absent 
himself, pretending affairs of great import. Amleth should be closeted 
alone with his mother in her chamber; but a man should first be com¬ 
missioned to place himself in a concealed part of the room and listen 
heedfully to what they talked about . . . The speaker, loth to seem 

1 Saxo, however, wrote gubernaculum , i.e., steering oar (3.6.10; Gesta Danonmi, 
C. Knabe and P. Herrmann, eds. [1931], p. 79). 



15 • The Chronicler's Tale 

readier to devise than to carry out the plot, zealously proffered him¬ 
self as the agent of the eavesdropping. Fengo rejoiced of the scheme, 
and departed on pretence of a long journey. Now he who had given 
this counsel repaired privily to the room where Amleth was shut up 
with his mother, and lay down skulking in the straw. But Amleth had 
his antidote for the treachery. 

Afraid of being overheard by some eavesdropper, he at first resorted 
to his usual imbecile ways, and crowed like a noisy cock, beating his 
arms together to mimic the flapping of wings. Then he mounted 
the straw and began to swing his body and jump again and again, 
wishing to try if aught lurked there in hiding. Feeling a lump beneath 
his feet, he drove his sword into the spot, and impaled him who lay 
hid. Then he dragged him from his concealment and slew him. Then, 
cutting his body into morsels, he seethed it in boiling water, and 
flung it through the mouth of an open sewer for the swine to eat, 
bestrewing the stinking mire with his hapless limbs. Having in this 
wise eluded the snare, he went back to the room. Then his mother 
set up a great wailing and began to lament her son’s folly to his face 
but he said: “Most infamous of women! dost thou seek with such 
lying lamentations to hide thy most heavy guilt? Wantoning like a 
harlot, thou hast entered a wicked and abominable state of wedlock, 
embracing with incestuous bosom thy husband’s slayer . . With 
such reproaches he rent the heart of his mother and redeemed her to 
walk in the ways of virtue. 

When Fengo returned, nowhere could he find the man who had sug¬ 
gested the treacherous espial . . . Amleth, among others, was asked in 
jest if he had come on any trace of him, and replied that the man had 
gone to the sewer, but had fallen through its bottom and been stifled 
by the floods of filth, and that he had then been devoured by the 
swine that came up all about that place. This speech was flouted by 
those who heard; for it seemed senseless, though really it expressly 
avowed the truth. 

Fengo now suspected that his stepson was certainly full of guile, and 
desired to make away with him, but durst not do the deed for fear of 
the displeasure, not only of Amleth’s grandsire Rorik, but also of his 
own wife. So he thought that the King of Britain should be employed 
to slay him, so that another could do the deed, and he be able to feign 
innocence . . . 

Amleth, on departing, gave secret orders to his mother to hang the 
hall with knotted tapestry, and to perform pretended obsequies for 
him a year from thence; promising that he would then return. 

Two retainers of Fengo then accompanied him, bearing a letter 
graven in wood . . . ; this letter enjoined the King of the Britons to 






Hamlet’s Mill • 16 


put to death the youth who was sent over to him. While they were 
reposing, Amleth searched their coffers, found the letter, and read 
the instructions therein. Whereupon he erased all the writing on the 
surface, substituted fresh characters, and so, changing the purport of 
the instructions, shifted his own doom upon his companions. Nor was 
he satisfied with removing from himself the sentence of death and 
passing the peril on to others, but added an entreaty that the King of 
Britain would grant his daughter in marriage to a youth of great 
judgment whom he was sending to him. Under this was falsely marked 
the signature of Fengo. 

Now when they had reached Britain, the envoys went to the king and 
proffered him the letter which they supposed was an implement of 
destruction to another, but which really betokened death to them¬ 
selves. The king dissembled the truth, and entreated them hospitably 
and kindly. Then Amleth scouted all the splendour of the royal ban¬ 
quet like vulgar viands, and abstaining very strangely, rejected that 
plenteous feast, refraining from the drink even as from the banquet. 
All marvelled that a youth and a foreigner should disdain the care¬ 
fully cooked dainties of the royal board and the luxurious banquet 
provided, as if it were some peasant’s relish. So, when the revel broke 
up, and the king was dismissing his friends to rest, he had a man sent 
into the sleeping room to listen secretly, in order that he might hear 
the midnight conversation of his guests. Now, when Amleth’s com¬ 
panions asked him why he had refrained from the feast of yestereve, 
as if it were poison, he answered that the bread was flecked with 
blood and tainted; that there was a tang of iron in the liquor; while 
the meats of the feast reeked the stench of a human carcase, and were 
infected by a kind of smack of the odour of the charnel. He further 
said that the king had the eyes of a slave, and that the queen had in 
three ways shown the behaviour of a bondmaid. Thus he reviled with 
insulting invective not so much the feast as its givers. And presently 
his companions, taunting him with his old defect of wits, began to 
flout him with many saucy jeers . . . 

All this the king heard from his retainer; and declared that he who 
could say such things had either more than mortal wisdom or more 
than mortal folly . . . Then he summoned his steward and asked him 
whence he had procured the bread . . . The king asked where the 
corn had grown of which it was made, and whether any sign was to 
be found there of human carnage? The other answered, that not far 
off was a field, covered with the ancient bones of slaughtered men, 
and still bearing plainly all the signs of ancient carnage . . . The 
king . . . took the pains to learn also what had been the source of the 
lard. The other declared that his hogs had, through negligence, 
strayed from keeping, and battened on the rotten carcase of a robber, 



ij • The Chronicler's Tale 


and that perchance their pork had thus come to have something of a 
corrupt smack. The king, finding that Amleth’s judgment was right 
in this thing also, asked of what liquor the steward had mixed the 
drink? Hearing that it had been brewed of water and meal, he had 
the spot of the spring pointed out to him, and set to digging deep 
down; and there he found rusted away, several swords, the tang 
whereof it was thought had tainted the waters. Others relate that 
Amleth blamed the drink because, while quaffing it, he had detected 
some bees that had fed in the paunch of a dead man; and that the 
taint, which had formerly been imparted to the combs, had reap¬ 
peared in the taste. The king . . . had a secret interview with his 
mother, and asked her who his father had really been. She said she 
had submitted to no man but the king. But when he threatened that 
he would have the truth out of her by a trial, he was told that he was 
the offspring of a slave . . . Abashed as he was with shame for his low 
estate, he was so ravished with the young man’s cleverness that he 
asked him why he had aspersed the queen with the reproach that she 
had demeaned herself like a slave? But while resenting that the court¬ 
liness of his wife had been accused in the midnight gossip of a guest, 
he found that her mother had been a bondmaid . . . 

Then the king adored the wisdom of Amleth as though it were in¬ 
spired, and gave him his daughter to wife; accepting his bare word 
as though it were a witness from the skies. 

Moreover, in order to fulfill the bidding of his friend, he hanged 
Amleth’s companions on the morrow. Amleth, feigning offence, 
treated this piece of kindness as a grievance, and received from the 
king, as compensation, some gold which he afterwards melted in the 
fire, and secretly caused to be poured into some hollowed sticks. 

When he had passed a whole year with the king he obtained leave to 
make a journey, and returned to his own land, carrying away of all 
his princely wealth and state only the sticks which held the gold. On 
reaching Jutland, he exchanged his present attire for his ancient 
demeanour, which he had adopted for righteous ends . . . 

Covered with filth, he entered the banquet-room where his own 
obsequies were being held, and struck all men utterly aghast, rumour 
having falsely noised abroad his death. At last terror melted into 
mirth, and the guests jeered and taunted one another, that he, whose 
last rites they were celebrating as though he were dead, should ap¬ 
pear in the flesh. When he was asked concerning his comrades, he 
pointed to the sticks he was carrying, and said, “Here is both the one 
and the other.” This he observed with equal truth and pleasantry . . . 
for it pointed at the weregild of the slain as though it were them¬ 
selves. 




Hamlet’s Mill • 18 


Thereon, w ishing to bring the company into a gayer mood, he joined 
the cupbearers, and diligently did the office of plying the drink. 
Then, to prevent his loose dress hampering his walk, he girded his 
sword upon his side, and purposely drawing it several times, pricked 
his fingers with its point. The bystanders accordingly had both sword 
and scabbard riveted across with an iron nail. Then, to smooth the 
way more safely to his plot, he went to the lords and plied them 
heavily with draught upon draught, and drenched them all so deep 
in wine, that their feet were made feeble with drunkenness, and they 
turned to rest within the palace, making their bed where they had 
revelled . . . 

So he took out of his bosom the stakes he had long ago prepared, and 
went into the building, where the ground lay covered with the bodies 
of the nobles wheezing off their sleep and their debauch. Then, cut¬ 
ting away its supports, he brought down the hanging his mother had 
knitted, which covered the inner as well as the outer walls of the hall. 
This he flung upon the snorers, and then applying the crooked stakes, 
he knotted and bound them in such insoluble intricacy, that not one 
of the men beneath, however hard he might struggle, could contrive 
to rise. After this he set fire to the palace. The flames spread, scatter¬ 
ing the conflagration far and wide. It enveloped the whole dwelling, 
destroyed the palace, and burnt them all while they were either 
buried in deep sleep or vainly striving to arise. 

Then he went to the chamber of Fengo, who had before this been 
conducted by his train into his pavilion; plucked up a sword that 
chanced to be hanging to the bed, and planted his own in its place. 
Then, awakening his uncle, he told him that his nobles were perishing 
in the flames, and that Amleth was here, armed with his old crooks 
to help him, and thirsting to exact the vengeance, now long overdue, 
for his father’s murder. Fengo, on hearing this, leapt from his couch, 
but was cut down while, deprived of his own sword, he strove in 
vain to draw the strange one . . . O valiant Amleth, and worthy of 
immortal fame, who being shrewdly armed with a feint of folly, 
covered a wisdom too high for human wit under a marvellous dis¬ 
guise of silliness! and not only found in his subtlety means to protect 
his own safety, but also by its guidance found opportunity to avenge 
his father. By this skillful defence of himself, and strenuous revenge 
for his parent, he has left it doubtful whether we are to think more 
of his wit or his bravery. 

It is a far cry from Saxo’s tale and its uncouth setting to the 
Renaissance refinements of Shakespeare. This is nowhere more ob¬ 
vious than in the scene in the Queen’s hall, with its heaped straw 




19 * The Chronicler's Tale 

on the floor, its simmering caldrons, its open sewer, and the crude 
manner of disposing of “Polonius,” all befitting the rude Middle 
Ages. The whole sad, somber story of the lonely orphan prince is 
turned by Saxo into a Narrenspiel, yet a strong tradition permeates 
the artless narrative. Hamlet is the avenging power whose superior 
intellect confounds evildoers, but his intellect also brings light and 
strength to the helpless and ill-begotten who are made to recognize 
their misery. There is nothing pleasant in the revelation brought 
home to the English king, yet he humbles himself before the ruth¬ 
less insight and “adores” Hamlet’s wisdom as “though it were in¬ 
spired.” More clearly than in Shakespeare, Hamlet is the ambivalent 
power dispensing good and evil. It is clear also that certain episodes, 
like the exchange of swords with Fengo, are crude and pointless 
devices going counter to the heroic theme. These are set dramati¬ 
cally right only when handled by Shakespeare, but they seem to 
indicate an original rigid pattern based on the Ruse of Reason, as 
Hegel would say. Evil is never attacked frontally, even when con¬ 
vention would require it. It is made to defeat itself. Hamlet must 
not be conceived as a heroic misfit, but as a distributor of justice. 
Shakespeare has focused exactly right. He has avoided restoring the 
brutal, heroic element required by the saga, and made the drama 
instead wholly one of the mind. In the light of a higher clarity, who 
can ’scape whipping? 

It would be pointless to compare all over again the several ver¬ 
sions of the Hamlet scheme in the north and west of Europe, and 
in ancient Rome. This has been done very effectually. 2 Thus, it 
is possible to rely on the “identity” of the shadowy Icelandic 
Amlodhi (in a so-called fairy tale his name is Brjam), who is first 
mentioned in the ioth century, and appears anew in Iceland as a 
Danish reimport in the “Ambales Saga,” written in the 16th or 17th 
century. Parallels to Amlethus’ behavior and career have been found 

2 Besides F. Y. Powell’s introduction and appendix to Elton’s translation of Saxo 
Grammaticus’ The First Nine Books of the Danish History of Saxo Gra?nmaticus 
(1894), already cited at the opening of the chapter, see the following: P. Herr¬

in the Sagas of Hrolf Kraki, of Havelok the Dane, as well as in 
several Celtic myths. 3 

In the version reported by Saxo, Hamlet goes on to reign suc¬ 
cessfully. The sequel of his adventures is taken up in book IV of 
the Chronicle, but this narrative shows a very different hand. It is 
an inept job, made of several commonplaces from the repertory of 
ruse and fable, badly stitched together. When Hamlet, in addition 
to the English King’s daughter, is made to marry the Queen of 
Scotland, and bring his two wives home to live together in har¬ 
mony, we can suspect an incompetent attempt to establish a dynas¬ 
tic claim of the House of Denmark to the realm of Britain. Hamlet 
eventually falls in battle, but there is not much in the feats re¬ 
counted to justify Saxo’s dithyrambic conclusion that if he had 
lived longer he might have been another Hercules. The true per¬ 
sonage has been overlaid beyond recognition, although there still 
clings to him a numinous aura. Curiously enough, the misconstruing 
of Hamlet’s story in the direction of success continues today. In 
the recent Russian film version of Shakespeare’s play, Hamlet is 
shown as a purposeful, devious and ruthless character, bent only on 
carrying off a coup d’etat. Yet, in Saxo’s first part, the tragic 
meaning is clearly adumbrated when Hamlet’s return is timed to 
coincide with his own obsequies. The logic requires that he perish 
together with the tyrant. 

The name Amleth, Amlodhi, Middle English Amlaghe, Irish 
Amlaidhe, stands always for “simpleton,” “stupid,” “like unto a 
dumb animal.” It also remained in use as an adjective. Gollancz has 
pointed out that in “The Wars of Alexander,” an alliterative poem 
from the north of England largely translated from the Historia de 
Preliis, Alexander is twice thus mentioned contemptuously by his 
enemies: 

Thou Alexander, thou ape, thou amlaghe out of Greece 
Thou little thefe, thou losangere (1), thou lurkare in cities .. .

story of Harald and Haldan (told in Saxo’s seventh book): Zenker, Boeve-Amle-

Darius, inquiring about Alexander’s appearance, is shown by his 
courtiers a caricature graphically described: 

And thai in parchment him payntid , his person him shewid, 

Ane amlaghe , ane asaleny (z), ane ape of all othire, 

A wirling (3 ), a wayryngle (4), a ivaril-eghid (5) shrewe, 

The caitifeste creatour, that cried (6) was evire 4 

This image of the “caitiffest creature” goes insistently with cer¬ 
tain great figures of myth. With the figure of Hamlet there goes, 
too, the “dog” simile. This is true in Saxo’s Amlethus, in Ambales, in 
the Hrolfssaga Kraki, where the endangered ones, the two princes 
Helgi and Hroar (and in Saxo’s seventh book Harald and Haldan), 
are labeled dogs, and are called by the dog-names “Hopp and Ho.” 

Next comes what looks at first like the prototype of them all, the 
famous Roman story of Lucius Junius Brutus, the slayer of King 
Tarquin, as told first by Titus Livius. (The nickname Brutus 
again connotes the likeness to dumb brutes.) Gollancz says of it: 

The merest outline of the plot cannot fail to show the striking like¬ 
ness between the tales of Hamlet and Lucius Iunius Brutus. Apart 
from general resemblance (the usurping uncle; the persecuted 
nephew, who escapes by feigning madness; the journey; the oracular 
utterances; the outwitting of the comrades; the well-matured plans 
for vengeance), there are certain points in the former story which 
must have been borrowed directly from the latter. This is especially 
true of Hamlet’s device of hiding the gold inside the sticks. This 
could not be due to mere coincidence; and moreover, the evidence 
seems to show that Saxo himself borrowed this incident from the 
account of Brutus in Valerius Maximus; one phrase at least from the 
passage in the Memorabilia was transferred from Brutus to Hamlet 
(Saxo says of Hamlet “obtusi cordis esse,” Valerius “obtusi se cordis 
esse simulavit”). Saxo must have also read the Brutus story as told by 
Livy, and by later historians, whose versions were ultimately based on 
Dionysius of Halicarnassus. 5 

To juxtapose the twin brothers Hamlet and Brutus, here is the 
earlier portion of the tale of Brutus as told by Livy (7.56). The 
subsequent events connected with the rape of Lucrece are too well 
known to need repeating. 

4 (1) liar; (2) little ass; (3) dwarf; (4) little villain; (5) wall-eyed; (6) created.

While Tarquin was thus employed (on certain defensive measures), 
a dreadful prodigy appeared to him; a snake sliding out of a wooden 
pillar, terrified the beholders, and made them fly into the palace; and 
not only struck the king himself with sudden terror, but filled his 
breast with anxious apprehensions: so that, whereas in the case of 
public prodigies the Etrurian soothsayers only were applied to, being 
thoroughly frightened at this domestic apparition, as it were, he re¬ 
solved to send to Delphi, the most celebrated oracle in the world; 
and judging it unsafe to entrust the answers of the oracle to any other 
person, he sent his two sons into Greece, through lands unknown at 
that time, and seas still more unknown. Titus and Aruns set out, and, 
as a companion, there was sent with them Junius Brutus, son to 
Tarquinia, the king’s sister, a young man of a capacity widely dif¬ 
ferent from the assumed appearance he had put on. Having heard 
that the principal men in the state, and among the rest his brother, 
had been put to death by his uncle, he resolved that the king should 
find nothing in his capacity which he need dread, nor in his fortune 
which he need covet; and he determined to find security in contempt 
since in justice there was no protection. He took care, therefore, to 
fashion his behaviour to the resemblance of foolishness, and submit¬ 
ted himself and his portion to the king’s rapacity. Nor did he show 
any dislike of the surname Brutus, content that, under the cover of 
that appellation, the genius which was to be the deliverer of the 
Roman people should lie concealed, and wait the proper season for 
exertion . . . He was, at this time, carried to Delphi by the Tarquinii, 
rather as a subject of sport than as a companion; and is said to have 
brought, as an offering to Apollo, a golden wand inclosed in a staff 
of cornel wood, hollowed for the purpose, an emblem figurative of 
the state of his own capacity. When they were there, and had exe¬ 
cuted their father’s commission, the young men felt a wish to enquire 
to which of them the kingdom of Rome was to come; and we are told 
that these words were uttered from the bottom of the cave.—“Young 
men, whichever of you shall first kiss your mother, he shall possess 
the sovereign power at Rome” . . . Brutus judged that the expression 
of Apollo had another meaning, and as if he had accidentally stum¬ 
bled and fallen, he touched the earth with his lips, considering that 
she was the common mother of all mankind. 

For most conventional-minded philologists, Brutus was the an¬ 
swer to a prayer, even to the gold enclosed in a stick. They had the 
sound classical source, from which it is reassuring to derive develop¬ 
ments in the outlying provinces. They felt their task to be at an end. 
With a few trimmings of seasonal cults and fertility rites, the whole 






23 • The Chronicler's Tale 


Amlethus package was wrapped, sealed and delivered, to join the 
growing pile of settled issues. 

Yet even the Roman version was not without its disturbing 
peculiarities. Livy reports only the answer to the private question 
of the two princes. But if Tarquin had sent them to Delphi, it 
was to get an answer to his own fears. And the answer is to be 
found in Zonaras’ compendium of the early section of Dio Cassius’ 
lost Roman history. Delphic Apollo said that the king would lose 
his reign “when a dog would speak with human voice.” 6 There is 
no evidence that Saxo read Zonaras. 

There is also a strange variant to Tarquin’s prophetic nightmare 
reported by Livy. It does not lack authority, for it is mentioned 
in Cicero’s De divinatione (1.22) and taken from a lost tragedy on 
Brutus by Accius, an early Roman poet. Says Tarquin: “My dream 
was that shepherds drove up a herd and offered me two beautiful 
rams issued of the same mother. I sacrificed the best of the two, but 
the other charged me with its horns. As I was lying on the ground, 
gravely wounded, and looked up at heaven, I saw a great portent: 
the flaming orb of the sun coming from the right, took a new course 
and melted.” Well may the Etruscan soothsayers have been exer¬ 
cised about the rams and the changed course of the sun in the same 
image, for they were concerned with astronomy. This problem 
will be dealt with later. An interesting variant of this dream is found 
in the Ambales Saga, and it can hardly have come from Cicero. 7 

However all that may be, there is more than enough to suspect 
that the story goes back even farther than the Roman kings. Ac¬ 
cordingly scholars undertook to investigate the link with the Per¬ 
sian legend of Kyros, which turned out not to be rewarding. But 
Saxo himself, even if he read Valerius Maximus, contains features 
which are certainly outside the classical tradition, and he shows 
another way. 

From the Narrenspiel the account of Hamlet’s ride along the 
shore is worth a second look: He notices an old steering oar ( guher -

naculuvi) left over from a shipwreck, and he asks what it might be. 
“Why,” they say, “it is a big knife.” Then he remarks, “This is 
the right thing to carve such a huge ham”—by which he really 
means the sea. Then, Saxo goes on, “as they passed the sandhills 
and bade him look at the meal, meaning the sand, he replied that it 
had been ground small by the hoary tempests of the ocean. His 
companions praising his answer, he said he had spoken wittingly.” 

It is clear that Saxo at this point does not know what to do with 
the remarks, for he has always pointed out that Amlethus’ answers 
were meaningful. “For he was loth to be thought prone to lying 
about any matter, and wished to be held a stranger to falsehood, 
although he would never betray how far his keenness went.” This 
being the systematic theme of Hamlet’s adventure, a theme worked 
out and contrived to show him as a Sherlock Holmes in disguise, 
the two remarks quoted are the only ones left to look pointlessly 
silly. They do not fit. 

In fact, they come from a vastly different story. Snorri Sturluson, 
the learned poet of Iceland (1178-1241), in his Skaldskaparmal 
(“The Language of the Bards”) explains many kenningar of famous 
bards of the past. He quotes a verse from Snaebjorn, an Icelandic 
skald who had lived long before. This kenning has been the despair 
of translators, as is the case in any very ancient, partly lost poetic 
language. There are no less than three terms in the nine lines that 
can be considered hapax legomena, i.e., terms which occur only 
once. The most authoritative translation is that of Gollancz and 
here it is: 

’Tis said, sang Snaebjorn, that far out, off yonder ness, the Nine Maids 
of the Island Mill stir amain the host-cruel skerry-quern—they who 
in ages past ground Hamlet’s meal. The good chieftain furrows the 
hull’s lair with his ship’s beaked prow. Here the sea is called Am- 
lodhi’s mill. 8 

That is enough. Whatever the obscurities and ambiguities, one 
thing is clear: goodbye to Junius Brutus and the safe playgrounds 
of classical derivations.

This deals with the gray, stormy ocean of the North, its huge 
breakers grinding forever the granite skerries, and Amlodhi is its 
king. The quern has not vanished from our language. It is still the 
surf mill. Even the British Island Pilot, in its factual prose, conveys 
something of the power of the Nine Maids, whose very name is 
echoed in the Merry Men of Mey on Pentland Firth: 

When an ordinary gale has been blowing for many days, the whole 
force of the Atlantic is beating against the shores of the Orkneys; 
rocks of many tons in weight are lifted from their beds, and the roar 
of the surge may be heard for twenty miles; the breakers rise to the 
height of 6o feet . . . 

As the storm heightens, “all distinction between air and water is 
lost, everything seems enveloped in a thick smoke.” Pytheas, the 
first explorer of the North, called it the “sea lung,” and concluded 
this must be the end of the earth, where sky and water rejoin each 
other in the original chaos. 

This introduces a much more ancient and certainly independent 
tradition, whose sources are in early Norse myth—or at least run 
through it from a still more ancient lineage.
