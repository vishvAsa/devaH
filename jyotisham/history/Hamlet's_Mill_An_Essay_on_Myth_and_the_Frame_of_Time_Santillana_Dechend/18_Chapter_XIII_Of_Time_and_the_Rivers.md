Di, quibus imperium est animarum, umbraeque silentes 
Et Chaos et Phlegethon, loca tacentia late 
Sit mihi fas audita loqui... 

Virgil, Aeneid vi .264 

Q 

1^/ocrates’ inimitable habit of discussing serious things while 
telling an improbable story makes it very much worth while to take 
a closer look at his strange system of rivers. 

It appears again in Virgil, almost as a set piece. The Aeneid is 
noble court poetry, and was not intended to say much about the fate 
of souls; one cannot expect from it the grave explicit Pythagorean 
indications of Cicero’s Dream of Scipio. But while retaining con¬ 
ventional imagery and the official literary grand style which befitted 
a glorification of the Roman Empire, it repays attention to its hints, 
for Virgil was not only a subtle but a very learned poet. Thus, 
while Aeneas’ ingress into Hades begins with a clangorous overture 
of dark woods, specters, somber caves and awesome nocturnal rites, 
which betoken a real descent into Erebus below the earth, he soon 
finds himself in a much vaguer landscape, lbant obscari sola sub 
nocte per umbram . . . “On they went dimly, beneath the lonely 
night amid the gloom, through the empty halls of Dis and his 
unsubstantial realm, even as under the grudging light of an incon¬ 
stant moon lies a path in the forest.” 

The beauty of the lines disguises the fact that the voyage really 
is not through subterranean caverns crowded with the countless 
dead, but through great stretches of emptiness suggesting night

space, and once the party has crossed the rivers and passed the gates 
of Elysium thanks to the magic of the Golden Bough, they are in a 
serene land “whence, in the world above, the full flood of Eridanus 
rolls amid the forest.” Now Eridanus is and was in heaven—surely 
not, in this context, on the Lombard plain. And here also “an 
ampler aether clothes the meads with roseate light, and they know 
their own sun, and stars of their own.” There is no mention here 
of the “pallid plains of asphodel” of Homeric convention. Those 
hovering souls, “peoples and tribes unnumbered,” are clearly on the 
“true earth in heaven,” for it is also stated that many of them await 
the time of being born or reborn on earth in true Pythagorean 
fashion. And there is more than an Orphic hint in the words of 
father Anchises: “Fiery is the vigour and divine the source of those 
life-seeds, so far as harmful bodies clog them not . . .” But when 
they have lived, and died, “it must needs be that many a taint, long 
linked in growth, should in wondrous use become deeply ingrained. 
Therefore, they are schooled with penalties, for some the stain of 
guilt is washed away under swirling floods or burned out in fire. 
Each of us suffers his own spirit.” Some remain in the beyond 
and become pure soul; some, after a thousand years (this comes 
from Plato) are washed in Lethe and then sent to life and new 
trials. 

This is exactly Socrates’ belief. The words “above” and “below” 
are carefully equivocal, here as there, to respect popular atavistic 
beliefs or state religion, but this is Plato’s other world. 

When Dante took up Virgil’s wisdom, his strong Christian pre¬ 
conceptions compelled him to locate the world of ultimate punish¬ 
ment “physically below.” But his Purgatory is again above, under 
the open sky, and there is no question but that most, if not quite all, 
of Virgil’s world is a Purgatory and definitely “up above” too. 
Socrates’ strange descriptions have remained alive. 

But Virgil offers even more than this. In the Georgies it 

is said: “One pole is ever high above us, while the other, beneath 
our feet, is seen of black Styx and the shades infernal” (sub pedibus 
Styx atra videt Manesque profundi ). What can it mean, except that

Styx flows in sight of the other pole? The circle which began with 
I lesiod is now closed. 1 

Great poets seem to understand each other, and to use informa¬ 
tion usually withheld from the public; Dante carries on where the 
Aeneid left off. As the wanderers, Dante and the shade of Virgil as 
his guide, make their way through the upper reaches of Hell (In¬ 
ferno a ii. 102) they come across a little river which bubbles out of 
the rock. “Its water was dark more than grey-blue”; it is Styx, and as 
they go along it they come to the black Stygian marsh, where are 
immersed the souls of those who hated “life in the gentle light of the 
sun” and spent it in gloom and spite. Then they have to confront 
the walls of the fiery city of Dis, the ramparts of Inner Hell, 
guarded by legions of devils, by the Furies with the dreadful Gor¬ 
gon herself. It takes the intervention of a Heavenly Messenger to 
spring the barred gates with the touch of his wand (a variant of 
Aeneas’ Golden Bough) to admit the wanderers into the City of 
Perdition. As they proceed along the inner circle, there is a river 
of boiling red water, which eventually will turn into a waterfall 
plunging toward the bottom of the abyss (baratro = Tartaros). At 
this point Virgil remarks (xiv.85): “Of all that I have shown you 
since we came through the gate that is closed to none, there is 
nothing you have seen as notable as this stream, whose vapors screen 
us from the rain of fire.” Those are weighty words after all that 
they have gone through; then comes the explanation, a rather far¬ 
fetched one: “In the midst of the sea,” Virgil begins, “there lies a 
ruined country which is called Crete, under whose king [i.e., 
Saturn] the world was without vice.” There, at the heart of Mount 
Ida where Zeus was born of Rhea, there is a vast cavern in which 
sits a great statue. Dante is going back there to an ancient tradition 


1 The symmetry of both polar zones is clearly in the poet's mind. “Five zones 
comprise the heavens; whereof one is ever glowing with the flashing sun, ever 
scorched by his flames. Round this, at the world's ends, two stretch darkling to 
right and left, set fast in ice and black storms. Between them and the middle zone, 
two by grace of the Gods have been vouchsafed to feeble mortals; and a path is 
cut between the two [the ecliptic], wherein the slanting array of the Signs may 
turn" (Georgies 7.233-38). 




195 ’ O/' Time and the Rivers 

to be found in Pliny, that an earthquake broke open a cavern in 
the mountain, where a huge statue was found, of which not much 
was said, except that it was 46 cubits high; but Dante supplies the 
description from a famous vision of Daniel, when the prophet was 
asked by King Nebuchadnezzar to tell him what he had seen in a 
frightening dream that he could not remember. Daniel asked God 
to reveal to him the dream: 

“Thou, O king, sawest, and beheld a great image. This great image, 
whose size was immense, stood before thee; and the form thereof was 
terrible. This image’s head was of fine gold, his breast and his arms of 
silver, his belly and his thighs of bronze. His legs of iron, his feet part 
of iron, and part of clay. 

Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands which smote 
the image upon his feet that were of iron and clay, and brake them 
to pieces . . . and the stone that brake the image became a great 
mountain and filled the whole earth.” 

At this point Dante takes leave of Daniel, and with that in¬ 
souciance which marks him even when speaking of Holy Prophets, 
whom he treats as his equals, he dismisses the royal shenanigans in 
Babylon. His instinct tells him that the vision must really deal with 
older and loftier subjects, with the cosmos itself. Hence he proceeds 
to complete the vision on his own. The four metals stand for the 
four ages of man, and each of them except the gold (symbol of the 
Age of Innocence) is rent by a weeping crack from whence issue 
the rivers which carry the sins of mankind to the Nether World. 
They are Acheron, Styx and Phlegethon. We have noted that he de¬ 
scribes the original flow of Styx as dark gray-blue, or steel-blue 
(perso), just as written in Hesiod and Socrates that he had never 
read. It may have come to him by way of Servius or Macrobius, no 
matter; what is remarkable is the strictness with which he preserves 
the dimly understood tradition of the lapis lazuli landscape of Styx, 
which will be seen to extend all over the world. As far as Phlege¬ 
thon goes, the course of the stream follows quite exactly what 
Socrates had to say about Pyriphlegethon, the “flaming river.” We 
have seen in the Phaidon a low-placed fiery region traversed by a 
stream of lava, which even sends off real fire to the surface of the 




I Iamlet’s Mill • 196 

earth. "Whereas some interpreters thought it flowed through the in¬ 
terior of our earth, others transferred Pyriphlcgcthon, as well as the 
other rivers, into the human soul, 2 but there is little doubt that it 
was originally, as Dietcrich has claimed, 3 a stream of fiery light in 
heaven, as Eridanus was. In any case, the flaming torrent, as the 
Aeneid calls it, goes down in spirals carefully traced in Dante’s 
topography, until it cascades down with the other rivers to the icy 
lake of Cocytus, “where there is no more descent,” for it is the cen¬ 
ter, the Tartaros where Lucifer himself is frozen in the ice. (Dante 
has been respectful of the Christian tradition which makes the uni¬ 
verse, so to speak, diabolocentric.) But why docs he say that the 
fiery river is so particularly “notable”? 

G. Rabuse 4 has solved this puzzle in a careful analytical study of 
Dante’s three worlds. First, he has found by way of a little-known 
manuscript of late antiquity, the so-called “Third Vatican Mythog- 
rapher,” that the circular territory occupied by the Red River in 
Hell was meant “by certain writers” to be the exact counterpart of 
the circle of Mars in the skies “because they make the heavens to 
begin in the Nether World” (5.6.4). 5 So Numcnius was not wrong 
after all. The rivers are planetary. Dante subscribed to the doctrine 
and worked it out with a wealth of parallel features. Mars to him was 
important because, centrally placed in the planetary system, lie held 
the greatest force for good or evil in action. As the central note in 
the scale, he can also become the harmonizing force. Both Hermetic 
tradition and Dante himself arc very explicit about it. Is he the 
planetary Power that stands for Apollo? That requires future 
investigation. 

2 Cf. Macrobius, Commentary on the Dream of Scipio /.io.ii (Stahl trans., p. 
128): “Similarly, they thought that Phlcgcthon was merely the fires of our wraths 
and passions, that Acheron was the chagrin we experienced over having said or 
done something, . . . that Cocytus was anything that moved us to lamentation or 
tears, and that Styx was anything that plunged human minds into the abyss of 
mutual hatred.”

197 ' Of Time and the Rivers 

In the sky of Mars in his Paradise Dante placed the sign of the 
Cross (“I come to bring not peace but a sword”), a symbol of reck¬ 
less valor and utter sacrifice, exemplified by his own ancestor the 
Crusader with whom he passionately identified. In the circle of Mars 
in Hell he placed, albeit reluctantly, most of the great characters he 
really admired, from Farinata, Emperor Frederick II, his Chancellor 
Pier della Vigna, to Brunetto, Capaneus and many proud con¬ 
querors. In truth, even Ulysses belongs in it, clothed in the “ancient 
flame,” the symbol of his “ire” more than of his deceit. Virtues 
appear down there with the sign minus; they stand as fiery refusal, 
“blind greed and mad anger” which punish themselves: but their 
possessors are nonetheless, on the whole, noble, as, in the Nihongi, 
Brave-Swift-Impetuous-Male, the force of action par excellence. 
The meek may inherit the earth, but of the Kingdom of Heaven it 
has been written: violenti rapiunt illud. Christ stands in Dante as 
the Heliand, the conquering hero, the judge of the living and the 
dead: rex tremendae majestatis. 

However that may be, the equivalence of above and below, of 
the rivers with the planets, remains established. By artifice Dante 
brings in at this point the figure of the Colossus of Crete, built out 
of archaic mythical material. By identifying the rivers with the 
world-ages, he emphasizes the identity of the rivers with Time: not 
here the Time that brings into being, but that of passing away—the 
Time that takes along with it the “sinful dirt,” the load of errors of 
life as it is lived. 

Men’s minds in the 13th century were still very much alive to the 
archaic structure. But over and above this, by way of the Circle 
of Mars, an unexpected insight appears. Through the solemn Chris¬ 
tian architecture of the poem, through the subtle logical organiza¬ 
tion, beyond the “veil of strange verses” and the intention they 
cloaked, there is a glimpse of what the author cared for more than 
he would say, of the man Alighieri’s own existential choice. Poets 
cannot guard their own truth. Ulysses setting out toward the south¬ 
west in a last desperate attempt foreordained to failure by the order 
of things, trying to reach the “world denied to mortals,” swallowed 
by the whirlpool in sight of his goal, that is the symbol. It is re- 





Hamlet’s Mill • 198 

vcaled not by the poet’s conscious thinking, but by the power of the 
lines themselves, so utterly remote, like light coming from a “quasi- 
stcllar object.” To be sure, the Greek stayed lost in Hell for his 
ruthless resourcefulness in life as much as for his impiety: he was 
branded by Virgil as “dire and fierce”; the sentence was accepted. 
But he was the one who had willed to the last, even against God, 
to conquer experience and knowledge. His Luciferian loftiness re¬ 
mains in our memory more than the supreme harmony of the choirs 
of heaven. 

To pursue this hazardous inquiry the first source is Homer, “the 
teacher of Hellas.” The voyage of Odysseus to Hades is the first 
such expedition in Greek literature. It is undertaken by the weary 
hero to consult the shade of Teiresias about his future. The advice 
he eventually gets is startlingly outside the frame of his adventures 
and of the Odyssey itself (/o-5o8ff.). It will be necessary to come 
back to this strange prophecy. But as far as the voyage itself goes, 
Circe gives the hero these sailing instructions: 

“Set your mast, hoist your sail, and sit tight: the North Wind will 
take you along. When you have crossed over the ocean, you will see 
a low shore, and the groves of Persephoneia, tall poplars and fruit- 
wasting willows; there beach your ship beside deep-eddving Okeanos, 
and go on yourself to the dank house of Hades. 

There into Acheron, the river of pain, two streams flow, Pyriphlege- 
thon blazing with fire, and Cocytos resounding with lamentation, 
which is a branch of the hateful water of Styx: a rock is there, by 
which the two roaring streams unite. Draw near to this, brave man, 
and be careful to do what I bid you. Dig a pit about one cubit’s length 
along and across, and pour into it a drink-offering for all souls . . .” 

Many centuries later, a remarkable commentary on this passage 
was made by Krates of Pergamon, a mathematician and mythog- 
rapher of the Alexandrian period. It has been preserved by Strabo: 6 
Odysseus coming from Circe’s island, sailing to Hades and coming 
back, “must have used the part of the Ocean which goes from the 
hibernal tropic [of Capricorn] to the South Pole, and Circe helped

with sending the North Wind.” This is puzzling geography, but 
astronomically it makes sense, and Krates seems to have had good 
reasons of his own to make the South Pole the objective. 

The next information comes from Hesiod in his Theogony (775— 
814), and very obscure it is. After having heard of the “echoing 
halls” of Hades and Persephone, he says: 

“And there dwells the goddess loathed by the deathless gods, terrible 
Styx, eldest daughter of backflowing Ocean. She lives apart from the 
gods in her glorious house vaulted over with great rocks and propped 
up to heaven all around with silver pillars. Rarely does the daughter 
of Thaumas, swift-footed Iris, come to her with a message over the 
sea’s wide back. 

“But when strife and quarrel arise among the deathless gods, and 
when any one of them who live in the house of Olympus lies, then 
Zeus sends Iris to bring in a golden iug the great oath of the gods 
from far away, the famous cold water which trickles down from a 
high and beetling rock. 

“Far under the wide-pathed earth a branch of Oceanus flows through 
the dark night out of the holy stream, and a tenth pan of his water is 
allotted to her. With nine silver-swirling streams he winds about the 
earth and the sea’s wide back, and then falls into the main; but the 
tenth flows out from a rock, a sore trouble to the gods. For whoever 
of the deathless gods that hold the peaks of snowy Olympus pours a 
libation of her water and is forsworn, lies breathless until a full year 
is completed, and never comes near to taste ambrosia and nectar, but 
lies spiritless and voiceless on a strewn bed: and a heavy trance 
[coifia] covers him. 

“But when he has spent a long year in his sickness, another penance 
and a harder follows after the first. For nine years he is cut off from 
the eternal gods and never joins their councils or their feasts, nine full 
years. But in the tenth year he comes again to join the assemblies of 
the deathless gods who live in the house of Olympus. Such an oath, 
then, did the gods appoint the eternal and primeval water of Styx to 
be: and it spouts through a rugged place. 

“And there, all in their order, are the sources and limits of the dark 
earth and misty Tartarus and the unfruitful sea [pontos] and starry 
heaven, loathsome and dank, which even the gods abhor. And there 
are shining gates and an immoveable threshold of bronze having un¬ 
ending roots and it is grown of itself. And beyond, away from all 
the gods, are the Titans, beyond gloomy Chaos.’’ 







Hamlet’s Mill •

This is Hesiod’s version of the “Foundations of the Abyss.” Its 
very details make confusion worse confounded, as befits the sub¬ 
ject. The difficult word ogygion, translated often with “primeval,” 
seems to designate things vaguely beyond time and place; one might 
say, the hidden treasure at the end of the rainbow. It was also the 
name for the resting place of Kronos, where he awaited the time 
of his return. But the paradoxical piling up of sources, limits, 
“unending roots” of earth, sea, heaven, and Tartaros too, remove 
any thought of a location at the earth’s core, such as the cryptic 
words were popularly felt to convey. This “deeper than the deep” 
must have been “beyond the other side of the earth,” and for 
reasons of symmetry, opposite to our pole. The shining gates and 
the immovable threshold of bronze are said elsewhere in the text 
to be the gates of Night and Day. Two centuries later, Parmenides, 
taking up Hesiod’s allegorical language, speaks again of those gates 
of Night and Day . 7 But his image becomes clearer, as befits his 
invincibly geometrical imagination. The gates are “high up in the 
aether,” leading to the abode of the Goddess of Truth and Neces¬ 
sity, and in his case too they must be at the Pole for explicit reasons 
of symmetry. We once tentatively suggested the North Pole, but 
many concurrent clues would indicate now the other one, the un¬ 
known, the Utterly Inaccessible. Hesiod says that Styx is a branch 
of Okeanos in heaven, “under the wide-pathed earth”; its dreaded 
goddess lives in a house “propped up to heaven all around with sil¬ 
ver pillars,” the water drips from a high rock. It can be reached by 
Iris coming with her rainbow “from snowy Olympus in the north.” 
This ogygion region, that the gods abhor, has to be both under 
and beyond the earth; this should mean something like “on the 
other side of heaven.” Homer never spoke of “above” and “below” 
in the strict sense. He simply made Odysseus land on a flat shore 
far away. 

But what of the dreadful Styx which seems to be the core of the 
mystery? A river of death, even to gods, who can at least expect to 
come out of their coma at the appointed time. It is inimical to all

matter: it cracks glass, metal, stone, any container. Only a horse's 
hoof is proof against it, says the legend. 5 It adds that to men that 
water is inescapably lethal—except for one day of the year, which 
no one knows, when it becomes a water of immortality. This leads 
finally to the tragic ambiguity which gives drama to the tale of 
Gilgamesh and Alexander. 

It is clear by now that the rivers are understood to be Time— 
the time of heaven. But images have their own logic. Where are the 
sources? The Colossus of Crete is Dante's own invention. Before 
him, there were many other accounts of the cracks from which 
flow the world-ages. Kai Khusrau, the Iranian Amlethus, was per¬ 
secuted by a murderous uncle, established a Golden Age and then 
moved off in melancholy into the Great Beyond. The bad uncle, 
Afrasiyab, in his desperate efforts to seize the holy legitimacy, the 
“Glory" ( Hvarna ), had turned himself into a creature of the deep 
waters and plunged into the mystic Lake Vurukasha, diving after 
the '‘Glory." Three times he dove, but every time “this glory 
escaped, this glory went away": and at every try, it escaped 
through an outlet which led to a river to the Beyond. The name of 
the first outlet was Hausravah, the original Avestan name of Kai 
Khusrau. This should make the epoch and design tolerably plain. 

An equally ancient story of three outlets comes from Hawaii. 
It appears in Judge Fornander's invaluable Account compiled a 
century ago, when the tradition was still alive. The “living waters" 
belong to Kane, the world-creating Demiurge or craftsman god. 
These waters are to be found in an invisible divine country, Pali-uli 
(= blue mountain), where Kane, Ku, and Lono created the first 
man, Kumu honua (“earth-rooted") or alternatively, the living 
waters are on the “flying island of Kane" (the Greek Hephaistos 
lived also on a floating island). Fornander describes the spring of 
this ‘‘living water" as 

beautifully transparent and clear. Its banks are splendid. It had three 
outlets: one for Kane, one for Ku, one for Lono; and through these 
outlets the fish entered the pond. If the fish of this pond were thrown

56; also O. Waser, Roscher 4, cols. 15-4. 1576. Pausanias leaves it open whether 
or not Alexander was killed by means of Stygian water, as was fabled. 





Hamlet’s Mill • 202 


on the ground or on the fire, they did not die; and if a man had been 
killed and was after-wards sprinkled over with this water he did soon 
come to life again. 9 

An extraordinary theme has been set, that of the “revived fish” 
which will later show itself as central in Mid-Eastern myth, from 
Gilgamesh to Glaukos to Alexander himself. And then there are 
again the three outlets. These may help individualize the notion of 
Kane’s “spring of life,” which might otherwise sound as common¬ 
place to folklorists as the Fountain of Youth. But something really 
startling can be found in good sound Pythagorean tradition. Plu¬ 
tarch in his essay “Why oracles no longer give answer” tells us 
(422 e) that Petron, a Pythagorean of the early Italian school, a 
contemporary and friend to the great doctor Alcmaeon (c. 550 
b.c.) theorized that there must be many worlds—183 of them. More 
about these 183 worlds was reported by Kleombrotos, one of the 
persons taking part in the conversation about the obsolescence of 
oracles, who had received his information from a mysterious “man” 
who used to meet human beings only once every year near the 
Persian Gulf, spending “the other days of his life in association with 
roving nymphs and demigods” (42 ia). According to Kleombrotos, 
he placed these worlds on an equilateral triangle, sixty to each side, 
and one extra at each corner. No further reason is given, but 

they were so ordered that one always touched another in a circle, like 
those who dance in a ring. The plain within the triangle is . . . the 
foundation and common altar to all these worlds, which is called the 
Plain of Truth, in which lie the designs, moulds, ideas, and invariable 
examples of all things which were, or ever shall be; and about there is 
Eternity, whence flowed. Time, as from a river, into the worlds. 
Moreover, that the souls of men, if they have lived well in this world, 
do see these ideas once in ten thousand years; and that the most holy 
mystical ceremonies which are performed here are not more than a 
dream of this sacred vision. 10 

What is this? A mythical prefiguration of Plato’s metaphysics? 
And why this triangular “Plain of Truth,” which turns out again

to be a lake of Living Water? Pythagoreans did not care to explain. 
Nor did Plutarch. 11 But here is at least one original way of linking 
Eternity with the flow of Time. When it came to geometric fan¬ 
tasy, no one could outbid the Pythagoreans. 

11 Proclus (comm, on Plato’s Timaens 138B, ed. Diehl, BT, vol. /, p. 454) claimed 
this to be a “barbarous opinion” (doxe barbarike). He shows no particular interest 
in the triangular plain of truth, alias our “lake” with its outlets, but he has more to 
say about the 180 “subordinate” and the 3 “leading” worlds (hegemonas) at the 
angles, and how to interpret them. To which Festugiere, in his (highly welcome 
and marvelous) translation of Proclus’ commentary, remarks (vol. 2 , p. 336, n. 1): 
“On notera que Proclus donne a la fois moins et plus que Plutarque. A-t-il lu ces 
elucubrations pythagoriciennes elles-memes?”
