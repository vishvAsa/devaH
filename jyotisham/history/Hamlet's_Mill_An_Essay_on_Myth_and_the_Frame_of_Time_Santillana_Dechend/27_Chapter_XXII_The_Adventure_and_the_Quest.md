T 

JL he Epic of Gilgamesh in its first recorded version goes back 
to Sumerian times. 1 It has been rehearsed with variants by Hurrians 
and Hittites, by Babylonians and Assyrians. Even in the best recen¬ 
sions there are large gaps, many tablets are damaged beyond repair, 
and to aggravate these detrimental conditions one must add the 
efforts of a goodly number of specialists which have not helped to 
clarify matters. 

The story has been told many times over and it appears to be 
fairly secure in its main lines, a patrimony of world literature. 
Misleading as this appearance is—the way through those texts being 
incredibly slippery—it is best to leave it at face value for the 
present, giving only a brief outline of the accepted scheme in 
Heidel’s version. Then it will be possible to examine certain difficult 
points which may eventually upset the scheme altogether. 

Gilgamesh is claimed to have been one of the earliest kings of 
Uruk (or Erech). The circumstances of his fabled birth make him 
two-thirds god and one-third man, which makes him—in the sexa¬ 
gesimal system of Mesopotamia—two-thirds of 60 (= Anu) = 40, 
the number which characterized Enki-Ea, whence the latter’s de¬ 
nomination of “Shanabi (=%, i.e., of 60), and Nimin (Sumerian = 
40).” 2 Be that as it may, it is told that he lives in splendor and dis¬ 
soluteness, and makes a nuisance of himself until the gods bring re¬ 
lief to his people by rearing a human being, either twin or counter- 


1 See, for example, S. N. Kramer, “The Epic of Gilgamesh and Its Sumerian 
Sources,” JAOS 64 (1944), p. 11: “the poem was current in substantially the form 
in which we know it, as early as the first half of the second millennium b.c.”

part, 3 who can stand up to him. It is Enkidu, the man of the Wilds, 
a kind of wolf-child as simple as the beasts he plays with, a happy 
son of nature, hairy all over, grown to enormous strength. A harlot 
is sent out to seduce him, and through her he learns love and the 
ways of man, and is lured into the city (appendix #24). 

His first encounter with Gilgamesh is a fierce battle which rocks 
the community house and seems to damage the doorpost (appendix #25) until the king manages to subdue Enkidu and decides he is 
worthy of becoming his friend and playmate. 

Together they plan an expedition to the great Forest, to over¬ 
come the terrible ogre Huwawa or Humbaba, 4 5 whom the god Enlil, 
the so-called “god of storm” or “god of air,” had appointed as its 
guardian. Indeed, “Enlil has appointed him as a sevenfold terror 
to mortals ... his roaring is (like that of) a flood-storm, his mouth 
is fire, his breath is death! ” 3 

Even if it is taken for granted that fights with dragons or ogres 
were a popular subject once upon a time, some dry data on this 
“monster” would do no harm. He “is invariably called a god in the 
texts” 6 and appears to correspond to the Elamitic god Humba or 
Humban, who shares the title “the prevalent, the strong” with the 
planets Mercury and Jupiter and with Procyon (alpha Canis Mi- 
noris). He occurs, moreover, in a star list, carrying the determina¬ 
tive mul (Babylonian kakkab ) announcing stars, as mul Humba (appen¬ 
dix #26). The identification with Procyon may eventually turn out 
to be the decisive clue which will reconcile the Sumerian version 
with the many others. 

Ancient texts do not become more lucid if every strange-looking 
aspect is silently omitted, and so it is well to mention that Humbaba 


3 Actually, the goddess Aruru makes him “in the likeness of Anu,” literally “a 
zikru of Anu she conceived in her heart.” But Enkidu is also said to look like 
Gilgamesh “to a hair.” See A. L. Oppenheim, “Mesopotamian Mythology,” Orien¬ 
tal'll 1 7 (1948), pp. 24, 28. 

4 Huwawa in the Old Babylonian and Hittite versions, Humbaba in the Assyrian 
version.

6 Langdon, Semitic Mythology (1931), p. 253. See also F. Hommel, Ethnologie 
nnd Geographie des Alten Orients (1926), pp. 35, 42, claiming hum to mean 
“creator,” and talking of Humbaba (= Hum-is-the-father) as of the “guardian of 
the cedar of paradise.” 






Hamlet’s Mill • 290 


is some kind of a “god of intestines.” More than that, his head or 
face is built of intestines, and Langdon (MAR 7, 254) draws atten¬ 
tion to the fact that “the face of this monster ... is designed by a 
single winding line, except eyes.” Bohl, moreover, in his inquiry 
on the Babylonian origin of the labyrinth, 7 pointed out the Babylo¬ 
nian notion of the entrails as a labyrinthic “fortress of intestines.” 

This much about the “person” Humbaba, who is, evidently, no 
primitive monster at all, the less so, as his unattractive face strik¬ 
ingly resembles the features of Tlaloc, the so-called “rain-god” of 
the Aztecs, whose face is built up of two serpents. Precipitate iden¬ 
tifications lead only to mischief, 8 and the “Case Humbaba” is not 
even partly solved, despite many efforts. 

The only established features of the story seem to be that the 
heroes reached the forest of cedars, which is said to extend for “ten 
thousand double-hours” (say, 70,000 miles), and that they cut off 
the head of Humbaba after having felled, apparently, the largest of 
the cedars entrusted to Humbaba’s guard by Enlil, but the feat is 
not accomplished without the powerful help of Shamash-Helios 
“who sends a great storm to blind the monster and put him at their 
mercy.” 

Returned to Uruk, Gilgamesh washes his hair and garbs himself 
in festive attire. As he puts on his tiara, Ishtar, the goddess of love 
(in Sumerian, Inanna), is entranced with his looks and asks him to 
marry her. Gilgamesh rejects her, reminding her in scornful words 
of what happened to her previous mates, including the hapless Tam- 
muz, later known as Adonis. 

It is not unusual for a hero to refuse the love, and the unheard-of 
presents, offered by a goddess. In every such case only two celestial 
personalities are possible candidates for this role: the planet Venus, 
and Sirius, alias Sothis, who has some of the reputation of a harlot. 

7 F. M. Bohl, “Zum babylonischen Ursprung des Labyrinths,” in Festschrift 
Deimel (1935), PP- 6-23. 

8 Hommel, Ethnologie und Geographic , p. 35, dealing with an Elamitic star 
list, makes “Amman-ka-sibar (derived from Chumban-uk-sinarra . . . i.e., Chum- 
ban, king of the bolt? . . .) = Ninib-Alars.” We would hazard a premature guess 
that apart from Procyon, Mercury would be the safest bet, the second candidate 
being Jupiter; but the latter would never make a convincing lord of entrails, nor 
would any other outer planet: their orbits do not allow for such notions—and 
Venus is much too regular for this role. 









This terra-cotta mask shows the unlovely face of Humbaba/Huwawa, the guardian 
of the cedar felled by Gilgamesh and Enkidu. The title of “God of the fortress 
of intestines" is also given to him, and some scholars conclude from this title, as 
well as from the pictorial evidence, that Humbaba was the inhabitant and lord 
of the labyrinth, a predecessor of Minotaurus. 


























As revolting as the face of Humbaba are the features of Tlaloc, the so-called “rain- 
god” of Mexico. They are revealing, however: constructed out of two serpents, 
Tlaloc’s head represents, as it were, the caduceus of Hermes/Mercury. 
























The reason the caduceus, the face of Tlaloc, and the notion of a “god of intes¬ 
tines” point exclusively to Mercury, one of the inferior planets (together with 
Venus) which are nearer to the sun than our planet Earth, becomes evident from 
figures 3-5, which illustrate Mercury’s movements; it becomes even more evident 
if the representations of Mercury’s racing feats within one solar year are com¬ 
pared to those of one of the superior planets within the same time (figure 6). It 
takes Saturn thirty years to accomplish his revolution around the sun, returning 
to the same fixed star; Mercury comes around in eighty-seven days (sidereal 
revolution; 115 days synodical). 











The Egyptian goddess Serqet, or Selket. 



A green jasper scarab of Greco-Phoenician origin (6th~5th century b.c.) shows 
the goddess with “the rear of a four-legged, winged scorpion”; the archaeologists 
recognize “the fore part of Isis,” but the Scorpion lady is clearly in evidence. 

















In the Maya Codex Tro-Cortesianus we meet again the “old goddess with the 
scorpion’s tail,” although with a very different graphic convention. In Nicaragua 
and Honduras, “Mother Scorpion, who dwells at the end of the Milky Way,” is 
described as many-breasted. 









291 • The Adventure arid the Quest 

There is the story of Ugaritic Aqht. who shows mocking haughti¬ 
ness to Anat ; 9 of Picus who flatly turns down the offer of Circe and 
who is subsequently turned into the woodpecker by the angry god¬ 
dess; there is Arjuna—a “portion of Indra”—who rejected the 
heavenly Urvashi. whom he regarded as the “parent of my race, 
and object of reverence to me . . . and it behoveth thee to protect 
me as a son ." 10 

There is also Tafa'i of Tahiti (Maori: Tawhaki) who went with 
his five brothers courting an underworld princess. As a test, the 
suitors “were told to pull up by the roots an ava tree which was 
possessed by a demon, and which had caused the death of all who 
had attempted to disturb it." Three of the brothers were devoured 
by the demon; Tafa'i revived them, and then gladly renounced the 
hand of the princess . 11 (Ava = Kawa, and stands for the “next-best- 
substitute" for Amrita. the drink of immortality which is the prop¬ 
erty of the gods; mythologically Polynesian Kawa resembles almost 
exactly the Soma of Vedic literature; even the role of the “Kawa- 
filter" is an ancient Indian reminiscence; and. as befits the pseudo- 
drink-of-immortality, it is stolen, by Maui, or by Kaulu, exactly as 
happens in India, and in the Edda, and elsewhere). 

Meanwhile Ishtar, scorned, goes up to heaven in a rage, and 
extracts from Anu the promise that he will send down the Bull of 
Heaven to avenge her . 12 The Bull descends, awesome to behold. 

9 See C. H. Gordon. Ugaritic Literature (1949), pp. S4-103. This “Legend of 
Aqht'’ is the more relevant, in that the goddess wants nothing but “the Botr ” 
made by the Deus Faber and in Aqht's possession, and promises everything in¬ 
cluding immortality, if the youth will hand over mul BAX. that being its fateful 
name. Cf. above, pp. 215L, for this bow. 

10 Mbh. 545-46. Urvashi, the goddess, ‘"trembling with rage*’ condemned the 
hero to pass his time ""among females unregarded, and as a dancer, and desti¬ 
tute of manhood and scorned as a eunuch.” She raged the more, as she had, in 
anticipation, before actually visiting Ariuna, "‘mentally sported with him on a 
wide and excellent bed laid over with celestial sheets.” Arjuna had to suiter the 
curse of Urvashi in the thirteenth year of the exile of the Pandava, but he re¬ 
gained his power on the expiration of that year. 

11 T. Henry, Ancient Tahiti (1928), pp. 561 ff. 

12 L'garitic Anat, after having been rebuked by Aqht, goes to her father too, 
asking for revenge, and she goes "‘toward ’ll, at the course of the Two Rivers/ 
(at the midst of the streams) of the Two Deeps*’ (Gordon, p. 91). Ginsberg 
translation (AXET, p. 152): “Towards El of the Source of the Floods (in the 
midst of the headwaters) of the Two Oceans.” 








Hamlet’s Mill • 292 


With his first snort he downs a hundred warriors. But the two 
heroes tackle him. Enkidu takes hold of him by the tail, so that Gil- 
gamesh as espada can come in between the horns for the kill. The 
artisans of the town admire the size of those horns: “thirty pounds 
was their content of lapis lazuli.” (Lapis lazuli is the color sacred to 
Styx, as we have seen. In Mexico it is turquoise.) 

Ishtar appears on the walls of Uruk and curses the two heroes 
who have shamed her, but Enkidu tears out the right thigh of the 
Bull of Heaven and flings it in her face, amid brutal taunts (ap¬ 
pendix #27). It seems to be part of established procedure in those 
circles. Susanowo did the same to the sun-goddess Amaterasu, and 
so did Odin the Wild Hunter to the man who stymied him. 

A scene of popular triumph and rejoicings follows. But the gods 
have decided that Enkidu must die, and he is warned by a somber 
dream after he falls sick. 13 

The composition of the epic has been hitherto uncouth and repe¬ 
titious and, although it remains repetitious, it becomes poetry here. 
The despair and terror of Gilgamesh at watching the death of his 
friend is a more searing scene than Prince Gautama’s “discovery” 
of mortality. 14 

“Hearken unto me, O elders, [and give ear] unto me! 

It is for Enk[idu\, my friend, that I weep, 

Crying bitterly like unto a wailing woman 

[My friend], my [younger broth]er (?), x * who chased 

the wild ass of the open country [and] the panther of the steppe. 

Who seized and [killed] the bull of heaven; 


13 Gen. xlix.5-7 is frequently brought into the play here—the “twins” Simeon 
and Levi mutilating the bull—but we leave aside this whole chapter xlix bristling 
with allusions to lost knowledge. 

14 The quotation marks that enclose the word “discovery” are a measure of pre¬ 
caution, advisable in our times ruled by Euhemerism; the most edifying among the 
relevant model cases we found in DiakanofFs review article on Bohl’s translation of 
GE (see below): “F. Al. Th. de Liagre Boehl shares the opinion of A. Schott that 
the problem of human mortality was originally raised in the reign of Shulgi” 
(= Third Ur Period, between 2400 and 2350 b.c., according to T. Jacobsen: The 
Sumerian King List [1939], Table II). This “originally” is enough to show what 
happens to Orientalists once evolutionist platitudes have taken hold of them. 

15 See appendix #28. 








293 * The Adventure and the Quest 

Who overthrew Humbaba, that [dwelt] in the [cedar] forest —/ 

Now what sleep is this that has taken hold of [thee]?

He touched his heart, but it did not beat. 

Then he veiled [his] friend like a bride [ . . . ] 

He lifted his voice like a lion

My friend, whom I loved, has turned to clay.” 16 

Gilgamesh has no metaphysical temperament like the Lord 
Buddha. He sets out on his great voyage to find Utnapishtim the 
Distant, who dwells at “the mouth of the rivers’’ and who can pos¬ 
sibly tell him how to attain immortality. He arrives at the pass of 
the mountain of Mashu (“Twins”), “whose peaks reach as high as 
the banks of heaven—whose breast reaches down to the under¬ 
world—the scorpion people keep watch at its gate—those whose 
radiance is terrifying and whose look is death—whose frightful 
splendor 17 overwhelms mountains—who at the rising and setting of 
the sun keep watch over the sun.” 18 

16 Tabl. S, col. 2; Tabl. y, col. i, 3-5 (Heidel, pp. 62-64); Tabl. 10, col. 2, 5-7, 
11—12 (Heidel, p. 73). 

17 The word which Heidel translates as “frightful splendor” and Speiser 
(ANET) as “halo” is melcmmtu , the Babylonian equivalent of Iranian hvarna , the 
so-called “glory” for the sake of which the bad uncle Afrasiyab dived in vain, 
because it belonged to Kai Khusrau. 

18 That the Mashu mountain (s) does so “every day,” as translated by Heidel, 
Speiser, and others, is obviously wrong. Even if we stipulate, for the sake of peace, 
the idea of a terrestrial mountain, the sun is not in the habit of rising on the 
same spot every day, and it needs no profound astronomical knowledge to become 
aware of this fact. 



Hamlet’s Mill • 294 


The hero is seized “with fear and dismay,” but as he pleads with 
them, the scorpion-men recognize his partly divine nature. They 
warn him that he is going to travel through a darkness no one has 
traveled, but open the gate for him. 

“Along the road of the sun [he went?]—dense is the dark[ness 
and there is no light]” (Tabl. y, col. 4, 46). The successive stretches 
of 1, then 2, then 3 and so on to 12 double-hours he travels in dark¬ 
ness. At last it is light, and he finds himself in a garden of precious 
stones, carnelian and lapis lazuli, where he meets Siduri, the divine 
barmaid, “who dwells by the edge of the sea.” 

Under the eyes of severe philologists, slaves to exact “truth,” 
one dare not make light of this supposedly “geographical” item 
with its faint surrealistic tang. Here is a perfectly divine barmaid 
by the edge of the sea, called by many names in many languages. 
Her bar should be as long as the famed one in Shanghai, for she has 
along her shelves not only wine and beer, but more outlandish and 
antiquated drinks from many cultures, drinks such as honeymead, 
soma, sura (a kind of brandy), kawa, pulque, peyote-cocktail, de¬ 
coctions of ginseng. In short, from everywhere she has the ritual 
intoxicating beverages which comfort the dreary souls who are 
denied the drink of immortality. One might call these drinks Lethe, 
after all (appendix #29). 

Earnest translators have seriously concluded that the “sea” at the 
edge of which the barmaid dwells must be the Mediterranean, but 
there have also been votes for the Armenian mountains. Yet the 
hero’s itinerary suggests the celestial landscape instead, and the 
scorpion-men should be sought around Scorpius. The more so as 
lambda ypsilon Scorpii are counted among the Babylonian mashu- 
constellations, and these twins, lambda ypsilon, play an important 
role also in the so-called Babylonian Creation Epic, as weapons of 
Marduk. 

In any case, Siduri, who must be closely related to Aegir and 
Ran of the Edda with their strange “Bierstube,”—as well as to the 
nun Gertrude, in whose public house the souls spent the first night 
after death (see above, p. 208, n. 9)—takes pity on Gilgamesh in 
his ragged condition, listens to his tale of woe but advises him to 
return home and make the best of his life. Even Shamash comes 





295 * The Adventure and the Quest 

to him and tells him: “The life which thou seekest thou wilt not 
find.” But Gilgamesh goes on being afraid of eternal sleep: “Let 
mine eyes see the sun, that I may be sated with light.” 19 And he 
insists on being shown the way to Utnapishtim. Siduri warns: 
“Gilgamesh, there never has been a crossing; and whoever from 
the days of old has come thus far has not been able to cross 
the sea, [but] who besides Shamash crosses [it]? Difficult is the 
place of crossing . . . And deep are the waters of death, which bar 
its approaches.” And she warns him that, at the waters of death, 
“there is Urshanabi, the boatman of L'tnapishtim. Him let thy face 
behold.” 20 

Siduri-Sabitu sits “on the throne of the sea” ( kussu tamtim), and 
W. F. Albright, 21 picking up a notion of P. Jensen, thoroughly com¬ 
pares Siduri and Kalypso, whose island Ogygia is called by Homer 
“the Navel of the Sea” ( omphalos thalasses). Moreover, Albright 
points to “the similar figure of Ishara tamtim,” Ishara of the sea, the 
latter being the goddess of Scorpius, 22 corresponding to the Egyp¬ 
tian Scorpius-goddess Selket, and to “Mother Scorpion .. . dwelling 
at the end of the Milky Way, where she receives the souls of the 
dead; and from her, represented as a mother with many breasts, at 
which children take suck, come the souls of the new-born.” This 
last-mentioned “Mother Scorpion” is a legitimate citizen of ancient 
Nicaragua and Honduras, 23 an offshoot of the Mayas’ “Old God¬ 
dess with a scorpion’s tail.” 24 

At this point there is still another recurrence of the disheartening 
breakdown in communication between scholars. The Orientalists, 
taking the story of Gilgamesh as a “normal epic,” search for traces 

19 Old Babyl. Version, Tabl. /o, col. i, 8, 13 (Heidel, p. 69). 

20 Assyrian Version, Tabl. 10 , col. 2, 21-28 (Heidel, p. 74). Shanabi meaning 40, 
Ur-shanabi means something like ‘'he of 40”; Hommel rendered it ‘‘priest °f 4°-” 

21 W. F. Albright, ‘The Goddess of Life and Wisdom/’ AJSL 36 (1919-20), pp.

22 See appendix #30. The name of the goddess is pronounced Ish-khara. 

23 H. B. Alexander, Latin American Mythology (1920), p. 185. 

24 The many-breasted Mother Scorpion of Central America goes well with the 
farmer’s calendar of ancient Rome which attributes Scorpius to Diana (see F. Boll, 
Sphaera [1903], p. 473; W. Gundel, RE s.v. Scorpius, p. 602). It remains still dark, 
however, what caused Athanasius Kircher to localize the many-breasted Diana of 
the Ephesians into Aquarius, calling, moreover, this celestial department "Regnum 
Canubicum.” 





Hamlet’s Mill • 296 


of him in the physical landscape of the Near East, ignoring the 
work of equally learned scholars, experts in the heavens, whose 
well-prepared and organized tool kits have long been available to 
help in the search. One wonders whether the Orientalists, intent on 
reconstructing texts, have ever even heard of Boll and Gundel and 
men like them. Perhaps not, because they pass them by without a 
word. In any case, it is appropriate here to mention once again two 
valuable tool kits assembled by Franz Boll, 25 who presents the whole 
tradition on the constellations “Hades,” “Acherusian lake,” “ferry¬ 
man,” with many more details than are needed now, as they have 
survived in astrological tradition. These topoi are found together 
around the southern crossroads of Galaxy and ecliptic, between 
Scorpius and Sagittarius. Boll points out that, instead of the Scor¬ 
pion people, 26 Virgil (Aeneid 6 .i% 6 ) and Dante posted centaurs 
at the entrance of the underworld, representing Sagittarius. And so 
back to the quest; Gilgamesh faces Urshanabi, expecting to be fer¬ 
ried over the waters of death. The boatman demurs: the “stone 
images” have been broken by Gilgamesh (appendix #31). But at 
length he instructs the pilgrim to cut down 120 poles, each sixty 
cubits (thirty yards) in length. With these he must punt the boat 
along, so that his hands may not touch the waters of death. At last 
they reach the far shore; there is Utnapishtim the Distant. The hero 
is puzzled: “I look upon thee, thine appearance is not different, thou 
art like unto me. My heart had pictured thee as one perfect for the 
doing of battle; [but] thou liest (idly) on (thy) side, (or) on thy 
back; [Tell me], how didst thou enter into the company of the 
gods and obtain life (everlasting)?” 27

esp. pp. 235fT. (on p. 207 he votes for Centaurus as guardian of the netherworld 
instead of Sagittarius).

description of the fall of Phaethon, according to which the son of Helios lost 
his nerve, and let go the reins when Scorpius drew near, and to the death of 
Osiris on Athyr 17, the month when the Sun went through Scorpius (Plutarch, 
De Is. Os., c. 13, 356c).

297 * The Adventure and the Quest 

Utnapishtim is spry enough to tell in great detail the story of the 
Deluge. He tells how Enki-Ea has warned him of Enlil’s decision to 
wipe out mankind, and instructed him to build the Ark, without 
telling others of the impending danger. “Thus shalt thou say to 
them: [I will ... go] down to the apsu and dwell with Ea, my 
[lor]d.” He describes with great care the building and caulking 
of the ship, six decks, one iku (acre) the floor space, as much for 
each side, so that it was a perfect cube, exactly as Ea had ordered 
him to do. This measure “i-iku” is the name of the Pegasus-square, 
and the name of the temple of Marduk in Babylon, as is known 
from the New Year’s Ritual at Babylon, where it is said: “Iku-star, 
Esagil, image of heaven and earth.” 28 Shamash had let Utnapishtim 
know when to enter the ship and close the door. Then the cataracts 
of heaven open, “Irragal [= Nergal] pulls out the masts [appendix #32]; Ninurta comes along (and) causes the dikes to give way; 
The Anunnaki 29 raised (their) torches, lighting up the land with 
their brightness; The raging of Adad reached unto heaven (and) 
turned into darkness all that was light. 30 . . . (Even) the gods were 
terror-stricken at the deluge. They fled (and) ascended to the 
heaven of Anu; The gods cowered like dogs (and) crouched in

sus, see B. L. van der Waerden, “The Thirty-Six Stars,” JNES 8 (1949), pp. 13-15;

Fixsternhimmel (1913), p. 11. 

29 These divine beings of the “underworld” (their equivalent “above”: the 
Igigi) were also written A-nun-na-nun ki (Deimel, PB, pp. 57f.), i.e., they belong to 
NUN ki = Eridu (Canopus), the seat of Enki-Ea. The Sumerian name Anunna 
is interpreted as “(Gods who are) the seed of the ‘Prince,’ ” according to A. Falken- 
stein (“Die Anunna in der sumerischen Uberlieferung,” in Festschrift Landsberger 
[1965], pp. 128fF.). See also D. O. Edzard, “Die Mythologie der Sumerer und Ak- 
kader,” in Worterbuch der Mythologie , vol. /, p. 42: “Die ‘fiirstlichen’ Samens 
rsind],” the “Prince” (NUN) being Enki-Ea of Eridu. Concerning NUN = 
“Prince,” defined by T. Jacobsen as “one of authority based on respect only, 
settling disputes without recourse to force,” Falkenstein, politely, mentions: “Ganz 
abweichend K. Oberhuber: Der numinose Begriff ME im Sumerischen, S.6f.” The 
title of this opus (Innsbruck 1963, Innsbrucker Beitriige zur Kulturwissenschaft. 
Sonderheft 17) expresses sufficiently the hair-raising propositions that it contains, 
concerning A 1 E, NUN, and other termini.

mean ‘rage,’ but ‘stark stillness, bewilderment, consternation,’ ” and he translates

blackness all that had been light.”

distress (?). 31 Ishtar cried out like a woman in travail; the lovely- 
voiced lady of the g[odsJ lamented . . . ‘How could I command 
(such) evil in the assembly of the gods! How could I command war 
to destroy my people, For it is I who bring forth (these) my 
people . .The Anunnaki-gods wept with her; The gods sat bowed 
(and) weeping.” 

The end of the story is almost exactly that of Noah’s landing on 
the mountain, except that Noah sends out a raven and twice the 
dove, whereas Utnapishtim let fly dove, swallow, raven. 32 

When Enlil was still wroth because one family did escape, 
Enki-Ea, “who alone understands every matter” (//.176), took 
him to task: “How, o how couldst thou without reflection bring 
on (this) deluge?” He added severely that Enlil could have pun¬ 
ished only the sinful, and spared the innocent. The remark is one 
that pious exegetes of the Bible are still left to ponder. Then Enlil 
went up to the Ark and apologized. He granted Utnapishtim and 
his wife “to be like unto us gods. In the distance, at the mouth of 
the rivers, Utnapishtim shall dwell” (//. 194-95). 

“But now as for thee,” the old man concludes his tale (/ /. 197fF.), 
turning to Gilgamesh, “who will assemble the gods unto thee, that 
thou mayest find the life which thou seekest? Come, do not sleep 
for six days and seven nights.” 

We gather a gentle hint there from the Ancient of Days (Su¬ 
merian: Ziusudra, with Berossos: Xisuthros), also called Atrahasis, 
“the exceedingly wise.” It amounts to this: “Young man, you have 
come to the land where time has come to a stop, and the immor¬ 
tality granted to us consists in remaining conscious and partaking 
of truth while not being wholly awake. Now you try.” But Gilga¬ 
mesh cannot. “As he sits (there) on his hams, sleep like a rainstorm 
blows upon him” (//.2ooff.).

32 One is usually inclined to take such motifs as that of the sending out of birds 
—not to mention the particular species—for minor matters, but A. B. Rooth can 
teach us a remarkable lesson by means of her thorough inquiry: The Raven and 
the Carcass: An Investigation of a Motif in the Deluge Myth in Europe , Asia, and 
North America ( 1962 ). 






299 ' The Adventure ami the Quest 

One can imagine how Atrahasis-Umapishtim would explain some 
essentials during Gilgamesh's sleep. The Exceedingly Wise would 
point to “his like,'' to Kronos sleeping in his golden cave in Ogygia. 
as described by Plutarch. 33 and yet continuously giving “all the 
measures of the whole creation" to his beloved son Zeus, as de¬ 
scribed by Proclus. 34 The Exceedingly Wise would refer freely to 
characters faraway in time 35 and in geographical space, as only he is 
entitled to do—to Kiho-tumu. for instance, creator god of the 
Tuamotu islands. Kiho-tumu “the-All-Source" who sleeps, face 
downward, in “Great-Havaiki-the-Unattainable," and yet takes 
action when the "administration" oversteps the "laws" and measures 
given by him. In the most amiable words Utnapishtim would ad¬ 
monish the children of our century to perceive the divine mummies 
of Ptah and Osiris—Osiris the " strategos" of the Ship Argo —and 
to start to think about the mummies of gods, generally, about the 
idea of the Seven Sleepers of Ephesus on board the Argo, about the 
data given in the Liber Hemietis Trismegisti concerning the rele¬ 
vant degrees (in Taurus, dealing with latitudes south of the Ship) 
belonging to Saturn, meaning “continua vero delectatio. diminutio 
substantiae, remissio malorum." Atrahasis would tell of the Chinese 
“Ancient Immortal of the Celestial South Pole." of the numerous 
sleeping Emperors in Mountain Caves (appendix =33)—and the 
hours would pass like seconds, but one knows that Utnapishtim. 
half-dreaming, half-teaching, had all the time an eye on the sleeping 
“hero." He says to his wife: "Is this the strong man who wants life

35 The oldest and most exact traits have a perplexing talent of surviving, and of 
turning up at unexpected places. Says R. S. Loomis (Arthurian Literature in the 
Middle Ages [1959] pp. 70-71): “We have a unique version of Arthur's survival 
alluded to by Godfrey of Viterbo, secretary to Frederick Barbarossa. about 
1190. Merlin prophesies that though the king will perish from his wounds, he will 
not perish wholly but will be preserved in the depths of the sea and will reign for 
ever as before.” Haze could the secretary to Frederick Barbarossa—an emperor 
who was himself bound to that place where expired ages and their rulers sleep— 
get hold of the “right” version? (We should be glad to learn, moreover, where 
the archaeologist Pierre Plantard [quoted by Gerard de Sede: Les Templiers sont 
parmi nous (196;), p. 2S0] got hold of the information on “Canopus. 1 'oeuil su¬ 
blime de l’architecte, qui s'ouvre tous les 70 ans pour contempler rUnivers."’) 





Hamlet’s Mill • 300 


everlasting?” And then, he wakens the man, on the seventh day, and 
the startled Gilgamcsh reacts thus: “Hardly did sleep spread over 
me, when quickly thou didst touch and rouse me.” 

Les jeux sont puts. Gilgamesh is given a change of raiment and 
told to go home; Urshanabi, the boatman, is told to escort him, and 
there is, evidently, no return again for him to pi ndrdti , to the mouth 
of the rivers. But at the last minute, Utnapishtim’s wife says to her 
husband: “Gilgamesh has come hither, he has become weary, he has 
exerted himself, What wilt thou give (him wherewith) he may re¬ 
turn to his land?” Utnapishtim takes compassion and addresses the 
hero: 

“Gilgamesh, I will reveal (unto thee) a hidden thing . . . There is a 
plant like a thorn . . . Like a rose (?) its thorn(s) will pr[ick thy 
hands]. If thy hands will obtain that plant, [thou wilt find new life]” 
(//.264-70). 

“New life” sounds misleading, and Speiser remarks: “Note that the 
process is one of rejuvenation, not immortality.” 36 

To get hold of this plant, growing apparently in a tunnel leading 
to the Apsu which the hero has to open, Gilgamesh dives deep, 
weighting himself with stones. But then as he travels home with the 
boatman, he stops to take a bath in a well, a serpent (literally, earth- 
lion) comes up from the water, snatches the plant and, returning 
into the water, sloughs its skin. The last hope is gone—at least so 
it iooks in the translations. 

Since this is not a manual on the Epic of Gilgamesh, this whole 
affair of the plant, the diving, the fateful bath in the well, must 
stand as it is, even though every word in it is no better than a man- 
trap (appendix #34), to come to the point which is of particular 
relevance here. 

Leaving the boat on the shore, Gilgamesh and the boatman walked 
for another 50 double-hours on the way home. 

When they arrived in Uruk, the enclosure, Gilgamesh said to him, to 
Urshanabi, the boatman: “Urshanabi, climb upon the wall of Uruk 
(and walk about); inspect the foundation terrace and examine the 
brickwork, (to see) if its brickwork is not of burnt bricks, And (if) 
the seven wise men did not lay its foundation!” (//.301-305).

• The Adventure and the Quest 


But before the Epic started (Tabl. i, 19), it was said that “the 
Seven Wise Ones” had laid the foundation of ramparted Uruk. So 
the ring has been closed. 

But what does it mean? Why is Urshanabi, of all people, asked 
to survey Uruk, enclosed—according to the rule—by seven walls? 
And what have the Seven Sages to do with the foundation of Gilga- 
mesh’s city? 

To take the latter question first: the Seven Sages are the stars 
of the Big Dipper, the Indian Saptarshi, the Seven Rishis. 37 The 
solstitial colure, called the “Line of the Seven Rishis,” happened to 
run through one after the other of these stars during several mil¬ 
lennia (starting with eta, around 4000 b.c.): and to establish this 
colure is “internationally” termed “to suspend the sky”—the Baby¬ 
lonians called the Big Dipper “bond of heaven,” “mother bond of 
heaven,” the Greeks spelled it “Omphaloessa.” 

Next, why is it the business of the boatman from the “confluence 
of the rivers” (that is what pi narati is) to check the measures of 
Uruk? It is established that the boatman’s name was “servant (or 
priest) of 40 or of %>” 38 and that makes him a “piece,” or what¬ 
ever one prefers to designate it, of Enki-Ea, called Shanabi = % 
(of 60 = 40). Enki’s residence is Eridu, at the confluence of the 
rivers, at mul NL T X ki = Canopus (alpha Carinae), the seat of the me, 
the norms and measures. From there these me have to be procured. 
Urshanabi, however, seems to be bound with close family ties to 
Enki-Ea, in fact to be his son-in-law, husband of Nanshe. 39 

Numerous texts and inscriptions show that Enki-Ea, Lord of 
the Apsu, was responsible for the ground plan of “temples,” 
whether celestial or terrestrial ones. The one who actually drew up 
the plans, with the “holy stylus” of Eridu, was Nanshe, Enki’s 

37 And exactly as the Indian texts have a lot to say about the Seven Rishis with 
their sister (and wife) Arundati, so the Mesopotamian ones talk about the “Sebettu 
with their sister Narundi ” (see H. Zimmern, “Die sieben Weisen Babyloniens,” 
ZA 55 [1923], p. 153; Edzard, vol. /, p. 55; H. and J. Lewy, “The Origin of the 
Week,” HUCA 77 [1942-43], p. 44). Arundati = Alcor, the tiny star near zeta 
Ursae Alajoris.

daughter. And to her, the wife of Urshanabi the boatman, the “holy 
stern of the ship was consecrated.” 40 

Considering that Argo is a stern only, that Eridu-Canopus marks 
the steering oar of Argo, it is fair to conclude that Gilgamesh, 
bringing with him Urshanabi in person, had procured “the me from 
Eridu.” This is how it is styled in the Sumerian “dialect”; 41 in the 
international mythical language the terminus technicus reads “to 
measure the depth of the sea.” (Odysseus, more advanced and ac¬ 
cordingly considerably more modest than Gilgamesh, did not even 
take over a veritable oar from Teiresias. He only procured the lat¬ 
ter’s advice, according to which he was, later, to take an oar and 
carry it inland until he found people who had never heard of or 
seen a ship) (appendix #35). 

Now that Gilgamesh “surveys” the world is stated explicitly in 
a text. (That this truth is uttered involuntarily by the translator 
who meant to express “that he saw everything” makes it the more 
enjoyable.) The invocation, quoted by Lambert, says: 

Gilgamesh, supreme king, judge of the Anunnaki, 

Deliberative prince, the ... of the peoples, 

Who surveys the regions of the world, bailiff of the underworld, 

lord of the (peoples) beneath, 

You are a judge and have vision like a god. 

You stand in the underworld and give the final verdict. 

Your judgement is not altered, nor is your utterance neglected. 

You question, you inquire, you give judgement, you watch and you 

put things right. 

Shamash has entrusted to you verdicts and decisions. 

In your presence kings, regents and princes bow down. 

You watch the omens about them and give the decision. 42

accuse the much discussed “God Boat” (Dieu Bateau) of many seal cylinders of 
“bringing the me from Eridu,” particularly when the seals show a ground plan, 
or a stage tower in the making. See P. Amiet, La Glyptique Mesopotamienne

303 * The Adventure and the Quest 

That neither this nor other clear hints make the slightest impression 
upon once-and-for-all Euhemerists goes without saying. Any un¬ 
prejudiced student would at least ponder for some minutes about 
that opened water-tunnel or the well in which the “hero” was tak¬ 
ing a bath, once he comes to learn about a text, also mentioned by 
Lambert (p. 43), dealing with the digging of wells, where “an in¬ 
struction is given for the utterance of the words ''the well of Gil- 
gamesh ’ .. ., as the well is being dug. Since, when water is reached, 
it must be libated to Shamash, the Anunnaki, and any known spirit, 
the well is thought of as a connexion with the underworld” (appen¬ 
dix #36). 

It seems obvious that sooner or later the data on Gilgamesh 
—incompatible as they sound for the time being—have to be assem¬ 
bled on a common denominator. But this is not likely to be accom¬ 
plished unless the specialists renounce several of their firm precon¬ 
ceptions and make up their minds to a thorough re-examination 
of the whole case. 

For the time being it is worth paying attention to information 
such as that given by Strabo (/tf.1.5) on the tomb of Bel (ho ton 
Belon taphos) in Etemenanki, the Tower of Babylon, and to mind 
the baffling Mesopotamian texts dealing with gods cutting off each 
other’s necks and tearing out each other’s eyes. It well might be 
rewarding to look at the tombs of Anu and of Marduk, 43 to consider 
the fundamental role of the Abaton in Philae, tomb of Osiris, 44 and 
of divine sepulchers generally. The basic difficulty which has to be

kation des Marduk aus Assur,” ZA 47 (1942), pp. 241-48. H. Zimmern, “Zum baby-

lonian Akitu Festival (1926), pp. 105-108, 200-43. 

44 Apart from the Shabaka Inscription, the end of which is of the utmost rele¬ 
vance, the highest Egyptian oath was taken by “Osiris who lies in Philae,” as we 
know from Diodorus; the Greek gods took their most solemn oaths by the waters 
of Styx. We remember Virgil’s information on Styx who sees the celestial South 
Pole, and of the followers of Zeus who, before attacking Kronos, took their oath 
by Ara. “Oath-stars” are to be found, rather regularly, among the southern circum¬ 
polar constellations. As concerns swearing by Gilgamesh, see Ebeling, p. 127. Com¬ 
pare also Pallis (Akitu Festival , p. 238) who compares the “Mysteries of Osiris” in 
Abydos with the Babylonian New Year Festival built around the “dead” Marduk 
(who sits during the ceremonies “in the midst of Tiamat”). 




Hamlet’s Mill • 304 


overcome is our ignorance of the concrete meaning of the technical 
term “tomb,” whether one has to do with the Omphalos of Delphi, 
grave of Python, 45 with the “burial mound of dancing Myrina” 
(Iliad j.814), with the burial mound of Lugh Lamhfada’s foster 
mother, around which the Games of Tailltc were performed, or 
with many others. 

What is haunting is the suspicion that “Uruk” stands for a “new” 
realm of the dead, and that Gilgamesh is the one who was destined 
to “open the way” to this abode and to become its king, and the 
judge of the dead, like Osiris, and also Yama, of whom the Rigveda 
states (/0.14.1-2): (1) “Him, who followed the course of the great 
rivers, and who discovered the way for many, the Son of Vivasvat, 
the gatherer of peoples—King Yama we honor with sacrifice. 
(2) Yama is the one who first discovered the way; this trodden path 
is not to be taken away from us; on that way that our forefathers 
travelled when they left us, on that way the later born follow each 
his trail.” 48 

That neither Yama’s nor Gilgamesh’s “way” was, originally, 
meant to last forever and ever, goes without saying. Again and 
again the me must be brought from Eridu, the Depth of the Sea 
must be measured respectively, and again and again the sky has to 
be “suspended” by means of the “Line of the Seven Rishis”—the 
huge precessional clock does not stop. What has been stopped, in¬ 
stead, is the understanding among the heirs of the mythical language 
who, out of ignorance, failed to adapt this idiom to “preceded” situ¬ 
ations. Without thinking, they changed a movie into a set of stills, 
projected a complex motion into conventional posters, and de- 


45 Omphalos belongs among the words which are easily said and hard to 
“imagine.” Yet, during the Middle Ages, Jerusalem, with the Holy Sepulcher, was 
understood as the Omphalos of the earth and, moreover, the tomb of Adam lo¬ 
calized under the Cross in Golgatha, “in the middle of the earth.” (See, for ex¬ 
ample, Vita Adae et Evae, in F. Kampers, Mittelalterliche Sagen vom Paradiese 
und vom Holze des Kreuzes Christi (1897), pp. 23, io6f.; W. H. Roscher, Omphalos 
(1913), pp. 24-28. 

46 Cf. Atharva Veda 18. 1.50 (Whitney trans.): “Yama first found for us a track, 
that is not a pasture to be borne away, where our former Fathers went forth, there 
(go) those born (of them), along their own roads.”

stroyed, by this measure, all the sense of a carefully considered 
system. 47 

This might be dismissed as a minor tragedy, but it is just one of 
those “progressive measures” which violently interrupt the con¬ 
tinuity of tradition. There must have been several such eruptive and 
reckless “corrections of style”—otherwise it would be utterly in¬ 
comprehensible that all our most ancient texts consist of “Scholia” 
interpreting one or the other “antediluvian” “Book with seven 
seals.” In the case of that neglected tragedy just mentioned, 48 a 
tragedy coming from absentmindedness, the final blow was dealt 
to the tradition that had established “us,” mankind, as a unity. And 
if we did not have Plato’s Timaeus , it would be a hopeless task 
altogether to understand the reason which made it obligatory in 
those “archaic” times to watch the immense cosmic clock most 
carefully. Plato himself, to be sure, started on the way of all intel¬ 
lect—moving from thought to literature, from literature into phi¬ 
lology, before flowing into nothing; but let us make it clear, this 
official “trend” is not going to detract us from our own uncondi¬ 
tional respect. 

This essay could spend many chapters on the Timaeus, that 
“topos” from which come and to which return all “rivers” of cos¬ 
mological thought, and several more chapters on Phaedrus and 


47 In our most unheeding times, nobody will even notice when in the not too 
remote future Leo will be drowned in the sea when he arrives at the autumnal 
equinox: the constellation of Leo, undisputed “king” of the hot plains, was 
coined at a time when His Majesty of the Zodiac ruled the summer solstice, highest 
and hottest “point” of the sun’s orbit; and who will care for pitiable Aquarius 
having no more water to shed from his jars, once he has arrived at the vernal 
equinox—but, after all, who has considered poor Pisces, lying “high and dry” 
since the times of Christ, the opener of the Age of Pisces? His title “Fish,” i.e., 
Greek Ichthys, is officially explained as being the first letters of “ 7 esous Chreistos 
Theou Fios Soter”—Jesus Christ God’s Son Savior. 

48 Without going into details, we think it possible that it was this very change 
from “constellations” to “signs” and, more generally, the enthronement of that 
astronomical language which alone is recognized as “scientific” by contemporary 
historians, i.e., the terminology of “positional astronomy,” which interrupted Ho¬ 
meric tradition; the Greeks quoted Homer all day long, they interpreted him, they 
broke their heads about the significance of details: his terminology had died long 
ago. 





Hamlet’s Mill • 306 


Volitikos, on the Epinomis (entartarosed by the label “Pseudo-”), 
but we make it short. We leave aside the very “creation” which 
Timacus styles like the manufacturing of a planetarium—which is 
exactly what makes this creation difficult for non-mathematicians. 
But it can be done without here. What counts is this: When the 
Timacan Demiurge had constructed the “frame,” skambha, ruled 
by equator and ecliptic—called by Plato “the Same” and “the Dif¬ 
ferent”—which represent an X (spell it Khi, write it X) and when 
he had regulated the orbits of the planets according to harmonic 
proportions, he made “souls.” In manufacturing them, he used the 
same ingredients that he used when he had made the Soul of the 
Universe, the ingredients however, being “not so pure as before.” 
The Demiurge made “souls in equal number with the stars (psychas 
isarithmons tois astrois ), and distributed them, each soul to its sev¬ 
eral star.” 

There mounting them as it were in chariots, he showed them the 
nature of the universe and declared to them the laws of Destiny 
(nomous tous heimarmenous). There would be appointed a first in¬ 
carnation one and the same for all, that none might suffer disadvan¬ 
tage at his hands; and they were to be sown into the instruments of 
time; each one into that which was meet for it, and to be born as the 
most god-fearing of living creatures; and human nature being two¬ 
fold, the better sort was that which should thereafter be called 
“man.” 

And he who should live well for his due span of time should journey 
back to the habitation of his consort star and there live a happy and 
congenial life; but failing of this, he should shift at his second birth 
into a woman; and if in this condition he still did not cease from 
wickedness, then according to the character of his depravation, he 
should constantly be changed into some beast of a nature resembling 
the formation of that character, and should have no rest from the 
travail of these changes, until letting the revolution of the Same and 
Uniform within himself draw into its train all that turmoil of fire 
and water and air and earth that had later grown about it, he should 
control its irrational turbulence by discourse of reason and return 
once more to the form of his first and best condition. 

When he had delivered to them all these ordinances, to the end that 
he might be guiltless of the future wickedness of any of them, he 
sowed them, some in the Earth, some in the Moon, some in the other 
instruments of time (Timaeus 41E-42D). 






307 * The Adventure and the Quest 

There is no need to engage in the futile task of arguing the 
fairness of the Demiurge and his statement that all souls had the 
same chances in their first incarnation. That God must needs be 
innocent, and that man is guilty, anyway, is not a subject worth 
arguing with Plato. In fact, this is the hypothesis upon which the 
whole great edifice of Christian religion, and of our jurisdiction, 
rests. 

In any event, the faultless Demiurge sowed the souls, equal in 
number to the fixed stars, in the “instruments of time” (i.e., the 
planets), among which Timaeus counts the earth; he sowed, actu¬ 
ally, “each one into that which was meet for it.” 

What does that mean? Timaeus alludes here to an old system of 
connecting the fixed and the wandering members of the starry 
community—and not only the zodiacal “houses” and “exaltations” 
of the planets are meant, but fixed stars in general. One knows this 
approach from astrological cuneiform tablets which contain a con¬ 
siderable number of statements on fixed representatives of a planet, 
and vice versa. But there is not enough to explain the rules of this 
sophisticated scheme. To say it with Ernst Weidner: “In any case 
we have to do with a very complicated system. Only a renewed 
collection and revision of the whole material will perhaps allow us 
to solve the still existing riddles.” 49 Ptolemy records the planetary 
character of fixed stars in his Tetrabiblos ( 1 .9 “Of the Power of the 
Fixed Stars”), and so did all ancient and medieval astrologers. And, 
one might add, so did Indian and Mexican astrologers. (See above, 
p. 157, about the privilege enjoyed by Mars and the Pleiades of 
representing each other in Babylonia and India.) 

The souls were, then, taken away from their fixed stars and 
moved to the corresponding planetary representatives, all according 
to rules and regulations. The Demiurge retired—turning into the 
character known under the title “Deus otiosus”—and the Time 
Machine was switched on. 

Cornford, in his translation and commentary on the Timaeus, 
states (p. 146): “In the machinery of the myth it is natural to sup- 

49 RLA 3, pp. 8if. Cf. Bezold in Boll’s Antike Beobachtung farbiger Sterne 
(1916), pp. 102-25 (table, p. 138); A. Jeremias, HAOG (1929), pp. 2ooff. 





Hamlet’s Mill • 308 


pose that the first generation of souls is sown on Earth, the rest 
await their turn, unembodied, in the planets.” 

With all the respect due to Cornford, this is hardly going to 
work, and no “natural” suppositions can be admitted. The Demi¬ 
urge of the Tinmens is too much of a systematist to allow for this 
solution. On the contrary, it stands to reason—if one carefully 
observes tbe manner in which the Craftsman God gradually and 
systematically attenuates his original mixture of Existence, Same¬ 
ness and Difference as described in Timaeiis 35—that some new 
principle, some new “dimension,” has to be introduced right 
here. 

Eternity abides in unity highest and farthest “outside.” Within, 
Time, its everlasting likeness, moves according to number, doing so 
by means of the daily turning of the fixed sphere in the sense of 
“the Same,” the celestial equator, and by means of the instruments 
of time, the planets, moving in the opposite direction along “the 
Different,” i.e., the ecliptic. Taken together, they represent the 
“eight motions.” With the next step, from the planets to the living 
creatures, the motion according to number is ruled out. The funda¬ 
mentally different quality of “motion” by generation must replace 
it (much to Plato’s regret). 

The planets, albeit “different” from the eternity abiding in unity 
as well as from the regular motion of the sphere of constellations, 
remain at least “themselves” and seven in number. The soul of man 
is not only reincarnated again and again, but it is subdivided further 
and further, since mankind multiplies, as does the grain to which 
man is so frequently compared. This simile—misinterpreted time 
and again by the fertility addicts—ought to be taken very seriously, 
and literally. The Demiurge did not create the individual souls of 
every man to be born in all future, he created the first ancestors of 
peoples, dynasties, etc., the “seed of mankind” that multiplies and 
is ground to mealy dust in the Mill of Time. The idea of “Fixed 
Star Souls” from which mortal life started, and to which exception¬ 
ally virtuous “souls once released” may return anytime, whereas 
the average “flour” from the mill has to wait patiently for the “last 
day” when it hopes to do the same—this idea is not only a vital part 
of the archaic system of the world, it explains to a certain degree

the almost obsessive interest in the celestial goings-on that ruled 
former millennia. 

Although still, in our time, most children are admonished to be¬ 
have decently, otherwise they may not have a chance to enter 
heaven, the Christians have abolished the Timaean scheme. They 
condemned as heresy the opinion of Origen according to which 
after the Last Judgment, the revived souls would have an ethereal 
and spherical body ( aitherion te kai sphairoeides) . This fundamen¬ 
tal concept has been given voice in many tongues throughout the 
‘’Belt of High Civilization." Sometimes the imagery is unmistakable, 
sometimes it is ambiguous enough to mislead modern interpreters 
completely, as when the starry “seed" of population groups comes 
our way under the title of a “totem.” But among the unmistakable 
kind is a rabbinical tradition which says that in Adam were con¬ 
tained the 600,000 souls of Israel like so many threads twisted 
together in the wick of a candle; the more so, as it is also said: “The 
Son of David [the Messiah] will not come before all souls that have 
been on the body of the first man, will come to an end.” 50 L T nmis- 
takable, also, is the myth of the Skidi Pawnee of the Great Plains 
dealing with “the last day”: “The command for the ending of all 
things will be given by the North Star, and the South Star will 
carry out the commands. Our people were made by the stars. When 
the time comes for all things to end our people will turn into small 
stars and will fly to the South Star where they belong.” 51 

As mentioned in the chapter on India (p. 77), the Mahabharata 
reports how the Pandavas toiled up the snowy mountain and were 
lost, and how Yudhishthira was finally removed bodily to heaven. 
Although they were planetary “heroes," the wording of how they 
came to their end is revealing with respect to mere human beings. 
The said heroes are called “portions" of the gods, and when the 
third world comes to its end and the Kali Yuga begins—it could 
not begin “as long as the sole of Krishna's holy foot touched the 
earth”—these “portions” are reunited with the gods of whom they 
are a part. Krishna returns into Vishnu, Yudhishthira into Dharma,

Arjuna is absorbed by Indra, Bala Rama by the Shesha-Serpent, and 
so forth. 

These examples will do. What they demonstrate is this: the 
Tiniaeus and, in fact, most Platonic myths, act like a floodlight 
that throws bright beams upon the whole of “high mythology.” 
Plato did not invent his myths, he used them in the right con¬ 
text—now and then mockingly—without divulging their precise 
meaning: whoever was entitled to the knowledge of the proper 
terminology would understand them. He did not care much for 
the “flour” after all. 

Living in our days, where nothing is hidden from the press and 
where every difficult science is “made easy,” we are not in the best 
condition to imagine the strict secrecy that surrounded archaic 
science. The condition is so bad, indeed, that the very fact is often 
regarded as a silly legend. It is not. The need for treating science 
as reserved knowledge is gravely stated by Copernicus himself in 
his immortal work, the Revolutions of Celestial Orbs . An adherent 
of the Pythagorean conception since his student days in Italy, he 
acknowledges the inspiration he owes to the great names of the 
School, like Philolaos and Hicetas, that he had learned from the 
classics, and who, he says, had given him the courage to oppose 
the philosophical notions current in his own time. “I care nothing,” 
he writes in his dedication to the Pope, “for those, even Church 
doctors, who repeat current prejudices. Mathematics is meant for 
mathematicians . . .” It is the authority of these ancient masters 
which gave him the independence of judgment to discover the cen¬ 
tral position of the sun in the center of the planetary system. A shy 
and retiring scholar, he appeals to that great tradition, which even 
in the time of Galileo was called “the Pythagorean persuasion,” to 
advance what was commonly considered a revolutionary and sub¬ 
versive theory. But if he did not bring himself to publish until his 
last years, it was not from fear of persecution, but from an ingrown 
aversion toward having the subject bandied around among the pub¬ 
lic. In the first book, he quotes from a “correspondence” among 
ancient adepts which is probably an ancient pastiche, but shows 
their way of thinking: “It would be well to remember the Master’s 





311 • The Adventure and the Quest 

precepts, and to communicate the gifts of philosophy to those who 
have never even dreamt of a purification of the soul. As to those 
who try to impart these doctrines in the wrong order and without 
preparation, they are like people who would pour pure water into 
a muddy cistern; they can only stir up the mud and lose the water.” 

Creating the language of the philosophy of the future, Plato still 
spoke the ancient tongue, representing, as it were, a living “Rosetta 
stone.” And accordingly—strange as it may sound to the specialists 
on Classical Antiquity—long experience has demonstrated this 
methodological rule of thumb: every scheme which occurs in 
myths from Iceland via China to pre-Columbian America, to which 
we have Platonic allusions, is “tottering with age,” and can be ac¬ 
cepted for genuine currency. It comes from that “Protopythago- 
rean” mint somewhere in the Fertile Crescent that, once, coined the 
technical language and delivered it to the Pythagoreans (among 
many other customers, as goes without saying). Strange, admit¬ 
tedly, but it works. It has worked before the time when we decided 
to choose Plato as Supreme Judge of Appeals in doubtful cases of 
comparative mythology, for example, when H. Baumann 32 recog¬ 
nized the myth of Plato’s Symposium (told, there, by Aristophanes) 
as the skeleton key to the doors of the thousand and one myths 
dealing with bisexual gods, bisexual souls, etc. 

Plato knew—and there is reason to assume that Eudoxus did, too 
—that the language of myth is, in principle, as ruthlessly generaliz¬ 
ing as up-to-date “tech talk.” The manner in which Plato uses it, 
the phenomena which he prefers to express in the mythical idiom, 
reveal his thorough understanding. There is no other technique, 
apparently, than myth, which succeeds in telling structure (again, 
remember Kipling, and how he tackled the problem by telling of 
the “ship that found herself”—see above, p. 49). The “trick” is: 
you begin by describing the reverse of what is known as reality, 
claiming that “once upon a time” things were thus and so, and 
worked out in a very strange manner, but then it happened that.. . 
What counts is nothing but the outcome, the result of the happen-

nnd Ritns ( 1955 ). 





I L\mlet’s Mill * 312 


ings told. Generally, it is overlooked that this manner of styling is 
a technical device only, and the mythographers of old are accused 
of having “believed” that in former times everything stood on its 
head (sec above, p. 292, n. 14, about the deplorable Mesopotamians 
who were unaware of their own mortality before the Gilgamcsh 
Epic was written). 

Since it is an actual language, the idiom of myth brings with it 
the emergence of poetry. Every classical philologist has to admit, 
for instance, that Hyginus and his like report the mythical plots 
rather faithfully in 3-10 lines of “correct” idiom which sounds 
hardly more interesting than average abstracts, whereas this instru¬ 
mental language, when used by Aeschylus, remains soul-shaking 
even to this day. But, however vast the difference of poetical rank 
among the mythographers, the terminology as such had been coined 
long before poets, whose names are familiar to us, entered the stage. 
To say “terminology,” however, sounds too dry and inadequate, 
for out of this mint have come clear-cut types—surviving for ex¬ 
ample, in the games of our children, in our chess figures and our 
playing cards—together with the adventures destined to them. And 
this spoken imagery has survived the rise and fall of empires and 
was tuned to new cultures and to new surroundings. 

The main merit of this language has turned out to be its built-in 
ambiguity. Myth can be used as a vehicle for handing down solid 
knowledge independently from the degree of insight of the people 
who do the actual telling of stories, fables, etc. In ancient times, 
moreover, it allowed the members of the archaic “brain trust” to 
“talk shop” unaffected by the presence of laymen: the danger of 
giving something away was practically nil. 

And now, coming back for a while to “The Adventure and the 
Quest,” one should emphasize that it is, of course, satisfactory to 
have cuneiform tablets and that it is reassuring that the experts 
know how to read different languages of the Ancient Near East; 
but Gilgamesh and his search for immortality was not unknown in 
times before the deciphering of cuneiform writing. This is the result 
of that particular merit of mythical terminology that it is handed 






313 * The Adventure and the Quest 

down independently from the knowledge of the storyteller. (The 
obvious drawback of this technique is that the ambiguity persists; 
our contemporary experts are as quietly excluded from the dia¬ 
logue as were the laymen of old.) Thus, even if one supposes that 
Plato was among the last who really understood the technical lan¬ 
guage, “the stories” remained alive, often enough in the true old 
wording. Accordingly, one can watch how the hero of the “Ro- 
maunt of Alexander,” in his own right an undisputed historical per¬ 
sonality, slipped on Gilgamesh’s equipment, while at the same time 
slipping off whole chapters of sober history. 

Alexander had to measure the depth of the sea, he was carried by 
eagles up into the sky, and he traveled to the most unbelievable 
“seas” in search of the water of immortality. Expecting it to be in 
Paradise he sailed up the Nile, or the Ganges—but why repeat the 
chapter on Eridanus? A true replica of Gilgamesh, Alexander sailed 
to the magic place whence all waters come and to which they return. 
And if it was, allegedly, a serpent (“earth-lion”) who deprived 
Gilgamesh of the rejuvenating plant, the Alexander of the fable 
was defrauded unwittingly by a fish—just a salted one taken along 
as travel supply. But he was consciously betrayed by the cook 
Andreas (according to Pseudo-Kallisthenes), who had noticed the 
fish coming to life when it fell into the brook and who drank of the 
water himself without telling Alexander of this discovery. The 
king, in his righteous indignation, had him thrown into the sea with 
a millstone around his neck, thus effectually preventing the cook 
from enjoying his immortality. 

The range of significant variations of the many Alexander stories 
precludes anything more than superficial remarks about them, but 
they are relevant to Gilgamesh who has, perforce, been abandoned 
in a darkness which is in large part artificial. It is possible to outline 
some questions that may stir the problem of Gilgamesh out of its 
stagnation. There is also one detail that points in the direction of 
a proposition already put forward concerning Gilgamesh (p. 304). 

Alexander, says the fable, interrogates the Oracle of Sarapis in 
Egypt just as Gilgamesh interviewed Utnapishtim. Sarapis answers 






Hamlet’s Mill • 314 


evasively as concerns rhe span of life allotted to Alexander, but he 
points to the foundation of Alexandria and announces that the king 
will last on in this city “dead and not dead,” Alexandria being his 
sepulcher. In another version Sarapis states: “But after your death, 
you will be placed among the gods, and receive divine worship and 
offerings by many, when you have died and, yet, not died. For your 
tomb will be the very town which you are founding.” 53 

The grotesque monster Huwawa appears to be the pointer. 
Whatever approach is chosen, Huwawa’s connection with Procyon, 
Jupiter and/or Mercury 54 should be taken into consideration, the 
more so, as the Hurrian fragments seem to know the poem under 
the title of “Epic of Huwawa.” 55 And along with this consideration, 
the proper attention will have to be paid to the Babylonian name 
of Cancer, namely Nangar(u), “the Carpenter.” This is essential, 
because in the twelfth tablet of the Gilgamesh Epic, preserved only 
in Sumerian language, Gilgamesh complains bitterly of having lost 
his “pukku and mikku,” instead of having left them “in the house 


53 Franz Kampers, Alexander der Grosse (1901), p. 93L 

The derivation of the name Sarapis from Enki-Ea’s name sar apsl, as proposed 
by C. F. Lehmann-Haupt (see also A. Jeremias in Roscher s.v. Oannes, 5.590) 
makes sense; the more so as it does not exclude the connection of Sarapis with 
Apis, since Apis has the title “the repetition of Ptah.” Accidentally, a rather re¬ 
vealing shred of evidence fell into our hands, contained in Budge’s translation of 
the Ethiopic Alexander Romance (London 1896, p. 9): “When Nectanebus, king 
of Egypt and father of Alexander, had escaped to Macedonia, “the men of Egypt 
asked their god to tell them what had befallen their king.” That is what the 
Ethiopian text says, and Budge adds: “In Meusel’s text the god who is being asked 
is called ‘Hephaestus the head of the race of the gods,’ and in Mueller’s he is said 
to dwell in the Serapeum.” 

The common denominator of Ea-sar apsl, Ptah-Hephaistos, “he who is south 
of his wall,” “lord of the triakontaeteris,” is and remains the planet Saturn. Admit¬ 
tedly, we knew this before, but we wish to stress the point that those despised 
“late” traditions of the Romance represent useful “preservation tins”; i.e., if the 
Romance replaces Utnapishtim of the confluence of the rivers with Sarapis we 
can trust that there was a valid equation written down somewhere and known to 
the several redactors—all of them closely related to some “Wagner” and hostile 
toward any potential “Faust.” 

54 It is remarkable that the Tuamotuan “Hiro is said to be Procyon” (M. W. 
Makemson, The Morning Star Rises [1941], p. 270). Hiro (Maori: Whiro), the 
master-thief, is an unmistakable Mercurian character. 

55 H. Otten, in Gilgamesh et sa legende (1958), p. 140.

of the carpenter,” 56 where they would have been safe, apparently. 57 

Whoever reads the Epic in many translations is not likely to 
overlook the indications of a “fence,” or/and a “doorpost,” or 
frame of a door at such an improbable place as Huwawa’s great 
cedar “forest.” Why not also try to look out for the “enclosing of 
Gog and Magog” accomplished by Alexander and told still in the 
18th Sura of the Koran, the same Sura which deals with the coming 
to life of Moses’ travel-supply-fish at the “confluence of the rivers?” 
This “enclosure” is a great theme of medieval folklore, kept fear- 
somely alive by the sudden appearance of Mongol invasions. The 
story ran that Alexander had built iron gates over the mountain 
passes, that the monstrous brood of the Huns, spawning over the 
limitless plains of the East, had been kept in awe by trumpets sound¬ 
ing from the pass betokening a seemingly immortal conqueror, the 
“two-horned” hero who watched over the passes. But the trumpets 
had suddenly fallen silent, and a dwarf from the horde risked his 
way to the pass, and found the gate deserted. The trumpets were 
nothing but aeolian harps, stilled by a tribe of owls which had 
nested in them. 58 

The ancient story of Gog and Magog, revived from the Arabs, 
plays such a decisive role in the Romance of Alexander that we 
might rely upon the antiquity of the scheme: actually it ought to oc¬ 
cur in our Epic. Considering that Gilgamesh appears to open a new 
passage, the former one has to be closed. This also was done in the 
case of Odysseus. Once he arrived in Ithaca with the stipulations for 
a new treaty with Poseidon, the poor Phaeacians were done for. 

56 A careful investigator has to be aware of the numerous traps along his way as, 
for example, the naughty custom of exchanging Scorpius and Cancer (Cicero for 
instance calls both constellations nepa) which seems to be on account of the simi¬ 
larity between the scorpion and the landcrab (Geocarcinus ruricula). 

57 “Pukku and mikku” (see below, p. 441) are lost “at the crying of a little girl” 
(C. J. Gadd, “Epic of Gilgamesh,” RA 50, p. 132): this sounds slightly improbable. 
It is laughter, if anything, that wrecks the old, and introduces the new age of the 
world. Maui lost his immortality because his companions laughed when he passed 
the “house of death” of the Great-Night-Hina. 

58 Cf. the thorough investigation by A. R. Anderson, Alexander's Gate , Gog and 
Magog , and the Inclosed Nations (1932). An early version of the story comes from 
a much-traveled Franciscan, Ricoldo da Montecroce. 




Hamlet’s Mill • 316 


There was to be no Scheria anymore. This station being closed up, 
growing mountains were to block off the beautiful island of Nau- 
sikaa which was, henceforth, “off limits” for travelers. There are 
some striking parallels available in Central Polynesia: when the 
younger Maui stole the fire from “old Maui” (Mauike, Mahuike, 
etc.) in the underworld, the passage which he had used was shut 
from that day on. This is particularly remarkable because “it was 
by the way of Tiki’s hole that Maui descended into the home of 
Mauike in search of fire.” Tiki (Ti’i) was the “first man,” and 
“Tiki’s hole had been the route by which souls were supposed to 
pass down to (H) Avaiki.” Thus, the souls had to find another way 
“after this hole had been closed,” 59 that is, after young Maui had 
accomplished the theft of fire. 

The notion of fire, in various forms, has been one of the recur¬ 
ring themes of this essay. Gilgamesh, like Prometheus, is intimately 
associated with it. The principle of fire, and the means of producing 
or acquiring it are best approached through them.
