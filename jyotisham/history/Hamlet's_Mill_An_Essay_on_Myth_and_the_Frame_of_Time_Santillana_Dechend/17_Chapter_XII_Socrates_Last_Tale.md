A 1 suo aspetto tal dentro mi fei 
Qual si fe' Glauco nel gustar delTerba 
Che il fe' consorro in mar degli altri dei. 

Dante, Pjradiso i .6- 

w 

V V hat a max has to say in the last hours of his life deserves 
attention. Most especially if that man be Socrates, awaiting execu¬ 
tion in his jail and conversing with Pythagorean friends. He has 
already left the world behind, has made his philosophical will and 
is now quietly communing with his own truth. This is the close of 
the Pkaedo ( io~D— 115.x). and it is expressed in the form of a myth. 
Strangely enough, innumerable commentators have not taken the 
trouble to scrutinize it. and have been content to extract from it 
some pious generalities about the rewards of the soul. Yet it is a 
thoughtful and elaborate statement, attributed to an authority 
whom Socrates (or Plato) prefers not to name. It is clothed in a 
strange ph ysical garb. It is worth accepting Plato's suggestion to 
take it with due attention. Socrates is quietly moving into the other 
world, he is a denizen of it already, and his words stand, as it were, 
for a rite of passage: 

“The story goes that when a man dies his guardian deity, to whose lot 
it fell to watch over the man while he was alive, undertakes to con¬ 
duct him to some place where those who gather must submit their 
cases to judgment before journeying to the other world; and this they 
do with the guide to whom the task has been assigned of taking them 
there. When they have there met with their appropriate fates and 
waited the appropriate time, another guide brings them back here 
again, after many long cycles of time. The journey, then, is not as 
Aeschylus' Telephys describes it: he says that a single track leads to

the other world, but I don’t think that it is ‘single’ or ‘one’ at all. 
If it w ere, there would be no need of guides; no one would lose the 
way, if there were only one road. As it is, there seem to be many 
partings of the way and places where three roads meet. I say this, 
judging by the sacrifices and rites that are performed here. The 
orderly and wise soul follows on its way and is not ignorant of its 
surroundings; but that which yearns for the body, as I said before, 
after its long period of passionate excitement concerning the body 
and the visible region, departs only after much struggling and suffer¬ 
ing, taken by force, with great difficulty, by the appropriate deity. 
When it arrives where the others are, the unpurified soul, guilty of 
some act for which atonement has not been made, tainted with 
w icked murder or the commission of some other crime which is akin 
to this and w r ork of a kindred soul, is shunned and avoided by every¬ 
one, and no one will be its fellow r -traveller or guide, but all by itself 
it wanders, the victim of every kind of doubt and distraction, until 
certain periods of time have elapsed, and wffien they are completed, it 
is carried perforce to its appropriate habitation. But that soul which 
has spent its life in a pure and temperate fashion finds companions 
and divine guides, and each dw r ells in the place that is suited to it. 
There are many wonderful places in the w r orld, and the world itself 
is not of such a kind or so small as is supposed by those who generally 
discourse about it; of that a certain person has convinced me.” 

“How do you mean, Socrates?” asked Simmias. “I too have heard a 
great deal about the w r orld, but not the doctrine that has found favour 
with you. I w r ould much like to hear about it.” 

“Well, I don’t think it requires the skill of a Glaucus 1 to relate my 
theory; but to prove that it is true would be a task, I think, too dif¬ 
ficult for the skill of Glaucus. In the first place I wrould probably not 
even be capable of proving it, and then again, even if I did know how 
to, I don’t think my lifetime would be long enough for me to give 
the explanation. There is, however, no reason why I should not tell 
you about the shape of the earth as I believe it to be, and its various 
regions.” 

“That will certainly do,” said Simmias. 

“I am satisfied,” he said, “in the first place that if it is spherical and 
in the middle of the universe, it has no need of air or any other force 
of that sort to make it impossible for it to fall; it is sufficient by itself 
to maintain the symmetry of the universe and the equipoise of the 

1 Whoever this (unidentified) Glaucus is, he has nothing to do with the Glaucus 
of Anthedon mentioned in the epigraph, a fisherman who on eating a certain plant 
was overtaken by a transmutation and threw himself into the sea where he became 
a marine god. 








181 • Socrates' Last Tale 


earth itself. A thing which is in equipoise and placed in the midst of 
something symmetrical will not be able to incline more or less 
towards any particular direction; being in equilibrium, it will remain 
motionless. This is the first point,” he said, “of which I am con¬ 
vinced !” 2 

“And quite rightly so,” said Simmias. 

“And again, I am sure that it is very big,” he said, “and that we who 
live between the Phasis river and the pillars of Hercules inhabit only 
a small part of it, living round the coast of the sea like ants or frogs 
by a pond, while many others live elsewhere, in many similar regions. 
All over the earth there are many hollows of all sorts of shape and 
size, into which the water and mist and air have collected. The earth 
itself is a pure thing lying in the midst of the pure heavens, in which 
are the stars; and most of those who generally discourse about such 
things call these heavens the ‘ether.’ They say that these things I have 
mentioned are the precipitation of the ‘ether’ and flow continually 
into the hollows of the earth. We do not realize that we are living in 
the earth’s hollows, and suppose that we are living up above on the 
top of the earth — just as if someone living in the middle of the sea¬ 
bed were to suppose that he was living on the top of the sea, and 
then, noticing the sun and the stars through the water, were to 
imagine that the sea was sky; through sluggishness and weakness he 
might never have reached the top of the sea, nor by working his way 
up and popping up out of the sea into this region have observed how 
much purer and more beautiful it is than theirs; nor even heard about 
it from anyone who had seen it. That is exactly what has happened 
to us: we live in a hollow in the earth, but suppose that we are living 
on top of it; and we call the air sky, as though this were the sky, and 
the stars moved across it. But the truth of the matter is just the same 
—through weakness and sluggishness we are not able to pass through 
to the limit of the air. If anyone could climb to the air’s surface, or 
grow wings and fly up, then, as here the fishes of the sea pop their 
heads up and see our world, so he would pop his head up and catch 
sight of that upper region; and if his nature were such that he could 
bear the sight, he would come to realize that that was the real sky and 
the real light and the real earth. This earth of ours, and the stones, 
and all the region here is corrupted and corroded, just as the things 
in the sea are corroded by the brine; and in the sea nothing worth 
mentioning grows, and practically nothing is perfect—there are just 
caves and sand and indescribable mud and mire, wherever there is 

2 Thus far, this is Anaximander and his Principle of Sufficient Reason. But we 
cannot draw further conclusions: Socrates is, here, deep in his own myth already, 
and far beyond Ionian physics which, in his opinion, ought not to be taken 
seriously.

earth too, and there is nothing in any way comparable with the 
beautiful things of our world; but those things in the upper world, in 
their turn, would be seen far to surpass the things of our world. If it 
is a good thing to tell a story then you should listen, Simmias, and 
hear what the regions on the earth beneath the sky are really like.” 

“We should certainly very much like to hear this story, Socrates,” 
said Simmias. 

“In the first place, then, my friend, the true earth is said to appear to 
anyone looking at it from above like those balls which are made of 
twelve pieces of leather, variegated, a patchwork of colours, of which 
the colours that we know here—those that our painters use—are sam¬ 
ples, as it were. There the whole earth is made of such colours, and 
of colours much brighter and purer than these: part of it is purple, 
of wondrous beauty, and part again golden, and all that part which is 
white is whiter than the whiteness of chalk or snow; and it is made 
up of all the other colours likewise, and of even more numerous and 
more beautiful colours than those that we have seen. Indeed these 
very hollows of the earth, full of water and of air, are said to present 
a kind of colour as they glitter amid the variety of all the other 
colours, so that the whole appears as one continuous variegated pic¬ 
ture. And in this colourful world the same may be said of the things 
that grow up—trees and flowers and all the fruits; and in the same 
way again the smoothness and transparency and colours of the stars 
are more beautiful than in our world. Our little stones, these highly 
prized ones, sards and jaspers and emeralds and so on, are but frag¬ 
ments of those there; there, they say, everything is like this, or even 
more beautiful than these stones that we possess. The reason is that 
the stones there are pure, and not corroded or corrupted, as ours are, 
by rust and brine, as a result of all that has collected here, bringing 
ugliness and diseases to stones and to soil, and to animals and to plants 
besides. The earth itself, they say, is ornamented with all things, and 
moreover with gold and silver and all things of that sort. They are 
exposed to view on the surface, many in number and large, all over 
the earth, so that the earth is a sight for the blessed to behold. There 
are many living creatures upon it, including men; some live inland, 
some live round about the borders of the air as we do on the coasts 
of the sea, while others again live on islands encompassed by air near 
the mainland. In a word, what the water and the sea are to us, for our 
purposes, the air is to them; and what the air is to us, the ‘ether’ is to 
them. Their climate is such that they are free from illnesses, and live 
much longer than the inhabitants of our world, and surpass us in sight 
and hearing and wisdom and so on, by as much as the pureness of 
air surpasses that of water, and the pureness of ‘ether’ surpasses that 
of air. Moreover they have groves and temples sacred to the gods, in 











183 • Socrates' Last Tale 


which the gods really dwell, and utterances and prophesies and visions 
of the gods; and other such means of intercourse are for them direct 
and face to face. And they see the sun and moon and stars as they 
really are, and their blessedness in other respects is no less than in 
these. 

“This is the nature of the earth as a whole, and of the regions round 
about it, and in the earth, in the cavities all over its surface, are many 
regions, some deeper and wider than that in which we live, others 
deeper but with a narrower opening than ours, while others again are 
shallower than this one and broader. All of these are connected with 
each other by underground passages, some narrower, some wider— 
bored through in many different places; and they have channels along 
which much water flows, from one region to another, as into mixing- 
bowls; and they have, too, enormous ever-flowing underground 
rivers and enormous hot and cold springs, and a great deal of fire, 
and huge rivers of fire, and many rivers also of wet mud, some clearer, 
some denser, like the rivers of mud that flow before the lava in Sicily, 
and the lava itself; and they fill the several regions into which, at any 
given time, they happen to be flowing. They are all set in motion, 
upwards and downwards, by a sort of pulsation within the earth. 
The existence of this pulsation is due to something like this: one of 
the chasms of the earth is not only the biggest of them all, but is 
bored right through the earth—the one that Homer meant, when he 
said that it is Very far off, where is the deepest abyss of all below 
the earth.’ Homer elsewhere—and many other poets besides—have 
called this Tartarus. Now into this chasm all the rivers flow together, 
and then they all flow back out again; and their natures are deter¬ 
mined by the sort of earth through which they flow. The reason why 
all these streams flow out of here and flow in is this, that this fluid 
has no bottom or resting place: it simply pulsates and surges upwards 
and downwards, and the air and the wind round about it does the 
same; they follow with it, whenever it rushes to the far side of the 
earth, and again whenever it rushes back to this side, and as the breath 
that men breathe is always exhaled and inhaled in succession, so the 
wind pulsates in unison with the fluid, creating terrible, unimaginable 
blasts as it enters and as it comes out. Whenever the water withdraws 
to what we call the lower region, the streams flow into the regions 
on the farther side of the earth and fill them, like irrigating canals; 
and whenever it leaves those parts and rushes back here, it fills the 
streams here afresh, and they when filled flow through their several 
channels and through the earth, and as each set of streams arrives at 
the particular regions to which its passages lead, it creates seas and 
marshes and rivers and springs; and then, sinking back again down 
into the earth, some encircling larger and more numerous regions, 
others fewer and smaller, these streams issue back into Tartarus again 




Hamlet’s Mill • 184 


—some of them at a point much lower down than that from which 
they were emitted, others only a little lower, but all flow in below 
the place from which they poured forth. Some flow into the same 
part of Tartarus from which they sprang, some into the part on the 
opposite side; and others again go right round in a circle, coiling 
themselves round the earth several times like snakes, before descend¬ 
ing as low as possible and falling back again. 

“It is possible to descend in either direction as far as the centre, but 
not beyond, for the ground on either side begins to slope upwards in 
the face of both sets of streams. 

“There are many large streams of every sort, but among these many 
there are four that I would mention in particular. The largest, the 
one which flows all round in a circle furthest from the centre, is that 
which is called Oceanus; over against this, and flowing in the opposite 
direction, is Acheron, which flows through many desert places and 
finally, as it flows under the earth, reaches the Acherusian lake, where 
the souls of most of the dead arrive and spend certain appointed 
periods before being sent back again to the generations of living 
creatures. The third of these rivers issues forth between these two, 
and near the place where it issues forth it falls into a vast region 
burning with a great fire, and forms a marsh that is larger than our 
sea, boiling with water and mud. Thence it makes its way, turbulent 
and muddy, and as it coils its way round inside the earth it arrives, 
among other places, at the borders of the Acherusian lake, but it does 
not mix with the water of the lake; and having coiled round many 
times beneath the earth, it flows back at a lower point in Tartarus. 
This is the river they call Pyriphlegethon, and volcanoes belch forth 
lava from it in various parts of the world. Over against this, again, the 
fourth river flows out, into a region that is terrible and wild, all of a 
steely blue-grey colour, called the Stygian region; and the marsh 
which the river forms as it flows in is called the Styx. After issuing 
into this marsh and receiving terrible powers in its waters, it sinks 
down into the earth, and coiling itself round proceeds in the opposite 
direction to that of Pyriphlegethon, and then meets it coming from 
the opposite way at the Acherusian lake. The water of this river 
likewise mixes with no other, but itself goes round in a circle and then 
flows back into Tartarus opposite to Pyriphlegethon; and the name 
of this river, according to the poets, is Cocytus. 

“Such is the nature of the world; and when the dead reach the region 
to which their divine guides severally take them, they first stand trial, 
those who have lived nobly and piously, as well as those who have 
not. And those who are found to have lived neither particularly well 
nor particularly badly journey to Acheron, and embarking on such 
vessels as are provided for them arrive in them at the lake. There they 







185 • Socrates' Last Tale 

dwell and are purified; paying due penalties, they are absolved from 
any sins that they have committed, and receive rewards for their 
good deeds, each according to his merits. Those who are iudged in¬ 
curable because of the enormity of their crimes, having committed 
many heinous acts of sacrilege or many treacherous and abominable 
murders or crimes of that magnitude, are hurled by their fitting des¬ 
tiny into Tartarus, whence they never more emerge. Those who are 
judged to be guilty of crimes that are curable but nevertheless great 
—those, for example, who having done some act of violence to father 
or mother in anger live the rest of their lives repenting of their 
wickedness, or who have killed someone in other circumstances of a 
similar nature—must fall into Tartarus; but when they have fallen in 
and stayed there a year, the wave casts them forth—the murderers 
along Cocytus, those who have struck their fathers or mothers along 
Pyriphlegethon; and when they are being carried past the Acheru- 
sian lake, they shout and cry out to those whom they have murdered 
or outraged, and calling upon them beg and implore them to let them 
come out into the lake, and to receive them; and if they can prevail 
upon them, they come out and cease from their woes, but if not, they 
are carried again into Tartarus, and from there once more into the 
rivers, and they do not stop suffering this until they can prevail upon 
those whom they have wronged, for such is the sentence that the 
judges have pronounced upon them. Lastly, those who are found to 
have lived exceptionally good lives are released from these regions 
within the earth and allowed to depart from them as from a prison, 
and they reach the pure dwelling place up above and live on the sur¬ 
face of the earth; and of these, those who have sufficiently purified 
themselves by means of philosophy dwell free from the body for all 
time to come, and arrive at habitations even fairer than these, habita¬ 
tions that it is not easy to describe; and there is not time to make the 
attempt now. But for these reasons, Simmias, which we have dis¬ 
cussed, we should do all in our power to achieve some measure of 
virtue and of wisdom during our lives, for great is the reward, and 
great the hope. 

“No man of sense should affirm decisively that all this is exactly as I 
have described it. But that the nature of our souls and of their habita¬ 
tions is either as I have described or very similar, since the soul is 
shown to be immortal—that, I think, is a very proper belief to hold, 
and such as a man should risk: for the risk is well worth while. And 
one should repeat these things over and over again to oneself, like a 
charm, which is precisely the reason why I have spent so long in 
expounding the story now. 

‘Tor these reasons, then, a man should have no fears about his soul, if 
throughout his life he has rejected bodily pleasures and bodily adorn¬ 
ments, as being alien to it and doing more harm than good, and has 




Hamlet’s Mill • 186 


concentrated on the pleasures of learning, and having adorned his soul 
with adornments that are not alien to it, but appropriate—temperance 
and justice and courage and freedom and truth—continues to wait, 
thus prepared, for the time to come for him to journey to the other 
world. As for you, Simmias and Cebes and all you others, you will 
make your several journeys later, at an appointed time; but in my 
case, as a character in a tragedy might put it, Destiny is already sum¬ 
moning me; and it is almost time for me to go to the bath. I think it 
is better to have a bath before drinking the poison, and not to give 
the women the trouble of washing a corpse .” 3 

The end has an invincible beauty, calm and serene, already shim¬ 
mering with immortality, and yet preserving that light skeptical 
irony which makes “a man of sense” in this world. It puts the seal 
of confidence on what might otherwise be really an incantation 
that one repeats to himself in his last moments. 

Readers who are insensitive to this magic will be tempted to dis¬ 
miss the story as so much poetic nonsense. If Socrates, or rather 
Plato, is really talking of a system of rivers within the earth, then 
he obviously does not understand the first thing about hydraulics, 
and he has only let his fancy run wild. But looking again at the 
setting, one begins to wonder if he is referring at all to the earth as 
we understand it. He mentions a certain place where we live, and 
it looks like a marsh in a hollow or maybe like the bottom of a lake, 
full of rocks, and caverns, and sand, “and an endless slough of 
mud.” The “true earth,” which is like a ball of twelve colored 
pieces, is above us, and one may think instinctively that Plato refers 
to the upper limits of the stratosphere, but of course he has never 
heard of that. He is dealing with “another” world above us, and 
although there are some fantasies of lovely landscapes and animals 
and gems, it is in the “aether” as the Greeks understood it. It is 
above us, and centered like “our” place, whatever that is, on the 
center of the universe. There, the celestial bodies have become clear 
to the mind, and the gods are visible and present already. If they 
have “temples and houses in which they really dwell,” these look 
very much like the houses of the zodiac. Although some features 
are scrambled for keeping up an impression of the wondrous, one 

3 R. S. Bluck trans. (1955), pp. 128-39. 





187 ' Socrates' 1 Last Tale 


suspects that this is heaven pure and simple. Then comes the un¬ 
equivocal geometric countersign. 

That world is a dodecahedron. This is what the sphere of twelve 
pieces stands for: there is the same simile in the Timaeus (55c), 
and then it is said further that the Demiurge had the twelve faces 
decorated with figures (diazo,graph on) which certainly stand for 
the signs of the zodiac. A. E. Taylor insisted rather prosily that 
one cannot suppose the zodiacal band uniformly distributed on a 
spherical surface, and suggested that Plato (and Plutarch after him) 
had a dodecagon in mind and they did not know what they were 
talking about. This is an unsafe way of dealing with Plato, and 
Professor Taylor’s suffisance soon led him to grief. Yet Plutarch 
had warned him: the dodecahedron “seems to resemble both the 
Zodiac and the year.” 

Is their opinion true who think that he ascribed a dodecahedron to 
the globe, when he says that God made use of its bases and the ob¬ 
tuseness of its angles, avoiding all rectitude, it is flexible, and by 
circumtension, like globes made of twelve skins, it becomes circular 
and comprehensive. For it has twenty solid angles, each of which is 
contained by three obtuse planes, and each of these contains one and 
the fifth part of a right angle. Now it is made up of twelve equilateral 
and equangular quinquangles (or pentagons), each of which consists 
of thirty of the first scalene triangles. Therefore it seems to resemble 
both the Zodiac and the year, it being divided into the same number 
of parts as these. 4 

In other words, it is stereometrically the number 12, also the num¬ 
ber 30, the number 360 (“the elements which are produced when 
each pentagon is divided into 5 isosceles triangles and each of the 
latter into 6 scalene triangles”)—the golden section itself. This is 
what it means to think like a Pythagorean. 

Plato did not worry about future professional critics very much. 
He only provided a delectable image, and left them to puzzle it 
out. But what stands firm is the terminology. After the Demiurge 
had used the first four perfect bodies for the elements, says the 
Timaeus, he had the dodecahedron left over, and he used it for the 

4 Qnaestiones Platonicae 5.1, 1003c (R. Brown trans.), in Plutarch's Morals , ed. 
W. W. Goodwin (1870), vol. 5, p. 433. 




Hamlet’s Mill • 188 


frame of the whole. There is no need - to go into the reasons, 
geometrical and numerological, which fitted the “sphere of twelve 
pentagons,” as it was called, for the role. What counts here: it was 
the whole, the cosmos, that was meant. Plato had stood by the origi¬ 
nal Pythagorean tradition, which called cosmos the order of the 
sun, moon and planets with what it comprised. As a free-roving 
soul, you can look at it “from above.” (Archimedes in the Sand- 
reckoner still uses the term cosmos loosely in that sense, at least by 
way of a concession to old usage.) 

To conclude: the “true earth” was nothing but the Pythagorean 
cosmos, and the rivers that flowed from its surface to the center 
and back can hardly be imagined as strictly terrestrial: although 
with that curious archaic intrication of earth and heaven which 
has become familiar and which makes great rivers flow - from heaven 
to earth, it is not surprising to find oneself dealing with “real” fiery 
currents like Pyriphlegethon connected with volcanic fire. But 
where is Styx? Hardly down here, with its landscape of blue. And 
the immense storm-swept abyss of Tartar os is not a cavern under 
the ground, it belongs somewhere in “outer” space. 

This is all the world of the dead, from the surface down and 
throughout. It localizes as poorly as the nether world of the Repub¬ 
lic. The winding rivers which carry the dead and which go back 
on their tracks are suggestive more of astronomy than of hydrau¬ 
lics. The “seesaw” swinging of the earth (n.b.: it has to be the 
“true earth”) might well be the swinging of the ecliptic and the 
sky with the seasons. There is no need now to go into the con¬ 
fusing earthy or infernal details of the description except to note 
that Numenius of Apamea, an important exegete of Plato, comes 
out flatly with the contention that the other world rivers and Tar- 
taros itself are the “region of planets.” But Proclus, an even more 
important and learned exegete, comes out flatly against Numenius. 5 
Enough is known, indeed more than enough of the welter of orien¬ 
tal traditions on the Rivers of Heaven with their bewildering mix¬ 
ture of astronomical and biological imagery, which culminated in 
Anaximander’s idea of the “Boundless Flow,” the Apeiron, to see 

5 See F. Buffiere, Les Mythes d'Homere et la Fensee Grecque (1956), p. 444. 








189 • Socrates' Last Tale 


whence early Greece got its lore. It can be left alone here. But 
Socrates is citing an Orphic version, whence his restraint in naming 
his authorities, and its strange entities, such as Okeanos and Chro¬ 
nos, deserve attention. What is meant here is not Kronos, Saturn, 
but really Chronos, Time. As concerns Okeanos, even Jane Harri¬ 
son, who could hardly be accused of a tendency to search for the 
gods somewhere else than on the surface or in the interior of the 
earth, had to admit: “Okeanos is much more than Ocean and of 
other birth.” 6 In her eyes he is “a daimon of the upper air/’ An im¬ 
portant concession which may lead a long way. 

We bypass for the moment the imposing work of Eisler, Welten- 
mantel und Himmelszelt (1910), an inexhaustible lode but one 
which provides more information than guidance. Onians’ Origins of 
European Thought offers a more recent appraisal. 7 He compares 
Okeanos to Acheloiis, the primal river of water that “was con¬ 
ceived as a serpent with human head and horns.'’ He goes on: 

The procreation element in any body was the psyche, which ap¬ 
peared in the form of a serpent, Okeanos was, as may now be seen, 
the primeval psyche and this would be conceived as a serpent in rela¬ 
tion to procreative liquid . . . Thus we may see, for Homer, who 
refers allusively to the conception shared by his contemporaries, the 
universe had the form of an egg girt about by “Okeanos, who is the 
generation of All” . . . We can perhaps also better understand . . . 
why in this Orphic version [Frgs. 54, 57, 58 Kern] the serpent was 
called Chronos and why, when asked what Chronos was, Pythagoras 
answered that it was the psyche of the universe. According to Phere- 
kydes it was from the seed of Chronos that fire and air and water 
were produced. 

The great Orphic entity was Chronos Aion (the Iranian Zurvan 
akarana), commonly understood as “Time Unbounded,” and in 
“Aion” Professor Onians sees “the procreative fluid with which the 
psyche was identified, the spinal marrow believed to take serpent 
form” and it may well be so, since these are timeless ideas which 
still live today in ophidic cults and in the “kundalini” of Indian 
Yoga. But Aion certainly meant “a period of time,” and age, hence

the Soul, the World, Time, and Fate (zd ed. 1953), pp. 249^.

“world-age” and later “eternity,” and there is no reason to think 
that the biological meaning must have been prior and dominant. It 
is known that for the Orphics Chronos was mated to Ananke, 
Necessity, which also, according to the Pythagoreans, surrounds 
the universe. Time and Necessity circling the universe, this is a 
fairly clear and fundamental conception; it is linked with heavenly 
motions independently from biology, and it leads directly to Plato’s 
idea of time as “the moving image of eternity.” 

It would be helpful if historians of archaic thought would first 
present straight data, without pressing and squeezing their material 
into a shape that reflects their preconceived conclusion, that bio¬ 
logical images must come first in “primitive” psychology, like all 
that is concerned with generation. 

If one wants psychology, one can go back to Socrates in a very 
different phase of his life, where he is really talking psychology in 
the Theaetetus (152E): “When Homer sings the wonder of ‘Ocean 
whence sprang the Gods and Mother Tethys,’ does he not mean 
that all things are the offspring of flux and motion?” The question 
arises, would the ocean be an image of flux except for the tides? But 
Socrates’ Aegean had no tides. The image comes to him from 
Hesiod’s description of Okeanos (Theogony 79off.): “With nine 
swirling streams he winds about the earth and the sea’s wide back, 
and then falls into the main; but the tenth flows out from a rock, a 
sore trouble to the Gods.” That dreaded tenth is the river of Styx. 
Jane Harrison was right. Okeanos is “of another birth” than our 
Ocean. 

The authority of Berger can reconstruct the image. 8 The at¬ 
tributes of Okeanos in the literature are “deep-flowing,” “flowing- 
back-on-itself,” “untiring,” “placidly flowing,” “without billows.” 
These images, remarks Berger, suggest silence, regularity, depth, 
stillness, rotation—what belongs really to the starry heaven. Later 
the name was transferred to another more earthbound concept: the 
actual sea which was supposed to surround the land on all sides. 
But the explicit distinction, often repeated, from the “main” shows 
that this was never the original idea. If Okeanos is a “silver-swirl-

ing” river with many branches which obviously never were on sea 
or land, then the main is not the sea either, pontos or thalassa, it has 
to be the Waters Above. The Okeanos of myth preserves these 
imposing characters of remoteness and silence. He was the one who 
could remain by himself when Zeus commanded attendance in 
Olympus by all the gods. It was he who sent his daughters to 
lament over the chained outcast Prometheus, and offered his power¬ 
ful mediation on his behalf. He is the Father of Rivers; he dimly 
appears in tradition, indeed, as the original god of heaven in the 
past. He stands in an Orphic hymn 9 as “beloved end of the earth, 
ruler of the pole,” and in that famous ancient lexicon, the Ety- 
mologicum magnum, his name is seen to derive from “heaven.”
