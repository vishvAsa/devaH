title = "03 LENGTHS OF THE SOLAR MONTHS :"

+++



The Hindu solar month-lengths vary from 29 to 32, as the time of passing 30° of the ecliptic varies, accord ing to older data given in the Sūrya Siddhānta from 29.32 days to 31.64 days. These varying lengths, as is well-known, can be understood only from Kepler's first two laws, which were explained fully by Newton in 1687 on the basis of dynamics and law of universal gravitation, but these laws and their explanation were unknown to astronomers in 400 A.D. Further these month-lengths are different in the three Siddhāntas be cause they were calculated according to three different formulæ. On account of the ignorance of Kepler's laws. and of the shift of the equinoctial lines in the Earth's orbit ( vide C $ 5:6) the ancient astronomers probably assumed that the times of passage through 30° as calculated according to formulæ given by them would be valid for all times. But we now know this assumption to be incorrect, and cannot stick to the lengths as given in the Siddhantas, which also differ amongst themselves. 



Further, all the numbers expressing month-lengths are fractional, and different states, vix., Bengal, Orissa, Tamil Nad use different conventions for defining the day of the solar saṁkrānti ( vide C $ 5:6) i.e., the civil day (sunrise to sunrise) which should be regarded as the day when the sun passes successive 30° of arc, beginning from the Hindu zero-point. The different conventions have their own merits, let the orthodox Bengalee, Oriya, or Tamil Pandit argue it out amongst themselves, but we feel that a convention which makes the solar month vary from 29 to 32 is very inconvenient for civil life, and we are quite sure that if the authors of the Siddhāntas were aware of Kepler's Laws and the shifting of equinoctial lines on the Earth's orbit, they would never have prescribed rules which would make the number of days in a solar month vary from 29 to 32. We have, therefore, assigned lengths of 30 and 31 days to the months. But the moment of the sun's traversing any multiple of the 30th degree from the vernal equinoctial point has been indicated.



We have recommended the SAKA era, as this is the era par excellence used by all Indian astronomers, and had been used and is still used for calendaric calculations all over India, since the days of the Ujjain astronomers (first century A.D.). This is the only era used in all Indian scientific treatises. For other eras see C $ 5.8. 



The new solar calendar is scientific, applicable to all parts of India, and follows the Sūrya Siddhānta in all essential points, and is absolutely sound as regards its astronomical basis. The conventions have been revised with the sole object of having a uniform system for the whole of India.
