Justification of the Solar Calendar as proposed 

by the Committee It has been shown that the intention of the maker of Sarya Siddhānta and of other Siddhāntas was to start the year from the moment of sun's crossing the vernal equinoctial point and to start the civil year from the day following. The Committee has also adopted this view and proposed that the civil year for all-India use should start from the day following the V. E. day, i.e., from March 22. In the Vedic literature also it is found that the starting of the year was related with one or other of the cardinal days of the year. The Vedānga Jyōtiṣa started the year from the winter solstice day, the Brāhmaṇas started the year from the Indian spring (Vasanta) when the tropical (Sayana) longitude of the sun amounted to 330°, but in the Siddhāntic period the year-beginning coincided with the V. E. day. So in adopting the Sāyana system in our calendar calculations, the Indian tradition, from the Vedic times up to the Siddhāntic times, has been very faithfully observed. This has ensured that the Indian seasons would occupy permanent places in the calendar. . 

As regards the number of days. per month, although the Surya Siddhānta defines only the astronomical: solar month as the time taken by the sun to traverse 30° of arc of the ecliptic, four different conventions have been evolved in different States of India for determining the first day of the civil month from the actual time of transit as narrated earlier. None of the conventions is perfect. Such rules do not yield fixed number of days for a month, as a result of which it becomes extremely difficult for a chrono logist to locate any given date of this calendar, unambiguously, in the Gregorian calendar, without going through lengthy and laborious calculations. Moreover, the number of days of months obtained 

The broad divisions of the year into seasons or months are obtained by the solar calendar, but since for religious and social puposes the lunar calendar had been used in India from the Vedic times, it becomes incumbent to devise methods for pegging on the lunar calendar to the solar. 

· The extent to which the lunar calendar affects. Indian socio-religious life will be apparent from the tables of holidays we have given on pp. 117-154. There the religious and social ceremonies and observances and holidays of all states and communities are classified under the headings :: 

(1) Regulated by the solar calendar of the Siddhāntas; 

(2) Regulated by Gregorian dates ; (3) Regulated by the lunar calendar. 

The tables show that by far the largest number of religious holidays and other important social ceremonies are regulated by the lunar calendar. It is difficult to see how the lunar affiliation, inconvenient as it is, can be replaced altogether, short of a revolution in which we break entirely with our past. The lunar calendar will therefore continue to play a very important part as we continue to keep our connection with the past, and with our cherished traditions. 

Let us now restate the problems which arise when, with reference to India, we want to peg the lunar calendar to the solar, how it was tackled in the past, and how the Calendar Reform Committee wants to tackle it. 

The lunar month consists of 29.5306 days and 12 such lunar months fall short of the solar year by 10.88 days. After about 2 or 3 years one additional or inter calary lunar month is therefore necessary to make up the year; and in 19 years there are 7 such intercalary months. In Babylon and Greece there were fixed rules 

246 

have been introduced. Taking the mean vaules of the lunation-period and of the length of the solaryear, the time when one extra month (i.e., intercalary month) will have to be introduced can easily be determined. But the luminaries do not move with uniform angular motions (throughout their period of revolution and so the determination af the intercalary month on the basis of the actual movement of the sun and the moon is a very difficult problem. The calculations according to the mean motions are however shown below. 

Table 18– Calculation of intercalary months in a 

19-year cycle. 

for intercalation ; the intercalary months appeared at stated intervals and were placed at fixed positions in 

the calendar (vide 8 3.2). It appears that some kind of 

· rough rules of intercalation of lunar months were 

followed in India up to the first or second century A.D. when the calendar was framed according to the rules of Vedānga Jyotéṣa (vide § 5.4). Thereafter the Siddhāntic system of calendar-making began to develop, replacing the old Vedānga calendar. 

The Vedanga calendar as we have seen was crude and was based on approximate values of the lunar and solar periods, the calendar was framed on the mean motions of the luminaries, and as such an intercalary month was inserted regularly after every period of 

30 months. 

The Siddhānta Jyotiṣa introduced the idea of true positions of the luminaries as distinct from their mean positions, and devised rules for framing the calendar on the basis of the true positions, and adopted more correct values for the periods of the moon and the sun. But some time elapsed before new rules were adopted, and intercalary months. continued to be calculated on the basis of the mean motions of the sun and the moon, employing however more correct values of their periods as given by the Siddhāntas. In this connection the following remarks by Sewell and Dikṣit, in the Indian Calendar (p. 27) are worth noting. 

"It must be noted with regard to the intercalation and suppression of months, that whereas at present these are regulated by the sun's and moon's apparent motion,-in other words, by the apparent length of the solar and lunar months ---and though this practice has been in use at least from 1100 A.D. and was followed by Bhāskarācārya, there is evidence to show that in earlier times they were regulated by the mean length of months. It was at the time of the celebrated astronomer Srīpati (1039 A.D.) that the change of practice took place".

It would appear from the above figures that the 19-year cycle with 7 mala māsas is a better approxi mation if we adopt the tropical year, and the error gradually, increases with the sidereal year and the Surya Siddhānta year. In 11} cycles, i.e., in 220 years, the discrepancy would amount to only a day in the case of the tropical year. 

It is also seen that one intercalary month is to be added at intervals of 327 solar months, or in other words an intercalary month recurs alternately after 32 and 33 solar months. According to this scheme the intercalary months in a period of 19 years would be as follows:

Intercalary months or Malamasas. The length of the Surya Siddhānta year is 365.258756 days, and of a lunar month according to the S. S. is. 29.5305879 days. Twelve such lunar months fall short of the S. S. year by 10.891701 days. The lunar year therefore slides back on the solar scale each year by about 11 days. If the months were allowed to slide back continuously it would have completed the cycle in 33.5355 years, and the festivals attached to the lunar calendar would have moved through all the seasons of the year within this period, as now happens with the Islamic calendar.

INDIAN CALENDAR 

247 

But the makers of Indian calendars have not ; followed any scheme for intercalation based on mean motions. They evolved a plan for distinguishing an intercalary month from a normal month based on the true motions of the sun and the moon. This plan is. also followed in giving the name to a lunar month, as explained below : 

Siddhāntic rules for the Lunar Calendar There are two kinds of lunar months used in India, the new-moon ending and the full-moon ending. In calendarical calculations only the new-moon ending months are used. 

(i) The new-moon ending lunar month covers the period from one new-moon to the next. This is known as amanta or mukhya candra māsa. It gets the same name as the solar month in which the moment of initial new-moon of the month falls. For this purpose the solar month is to be reckoned from the exact moment of one saṁkrānti of the sun to the moment of the next sankranti. When a solar month completely covers a lunar month, i.e., when there are two moments of "new-moon (amānta), one at the beginning and the other 

at the end of a solar month, then the lunar month beginning from the first new-moon is the intercalary month, which is then called an adhika or mala māsa, and the lunar month beginning from the second new moon is the normal month which is termed as śuddha or nija in the Siddhāntic system. Both the months bear the name of the same solar month but are prefixed by adhika or śuddha as the case may be. In an adhika month religious observances are not generally allowed. . If on the other hand, a lunar month completely covers a solar month, no new-moon having occurred in that solar month, the particular lunar month is then called a kṣaya or decayed month. : As the mukhya or new-moon ending lunar month begins from the Amavasyā or the new-moon occurring in the solar month bearing the same name, the lunar month may begin on any day during that solar month -it may begin on the first or even on the last day of that solar month. : ? (ii) The full-moon ending lunar month known as pūrnimānta or gauna čāndra māsa, covers the period from one full-moon to the next, and is determined on the basis of the corresponding new-moon ending month as defined above. It begins from the moment of full moon just a fort-night before the initial new-moon of an amānta month, and it also takes the name of that month, 

...But in the gaunamāna (i.es, full-moon ending lunar month), as the month starts 15 days earlier than the 

new-moon ending month, it may begin on any day during the last half of the preceding solar month and the first half of the solar month in question. It will therefore be seen that wbile the new-moon ending or mukhya month sometimes falls almost entirely out side (i.e., after) the relative solar month, the full-moon ending or a gruna month always covers at least half of the solar month of that name. 

The months used for civil purposes in the Hindi calendar are the full-moon ending lunar months, and are sub-divided into two halves-krsna pakṣa covering the period from full-moon to new-moon and termed as vadi, and śukla pakṣa covering the period from new moon to full-moon and termed as sudi. As these months, are on the gauna māna, the vadi half of a month comes first followed by the sudi half. The last day of the year is therefore a full-moon day, the Phalguni (or Holi ) Purnima, in keeping with the ancient Indian custom. 

The Samvat and śaka years in the Hindi calendar begins with Caitra śukla Pratipad. For astronomical purposes, however, the year begins a few days later with the entrance of the sun into Meṣa. 

The calendars of Āṣādhi Samvat and Kārtiki Samvat are, on the other hand, based on the new-moon ending months, and consequently the months begin 15 days later than the months of the Caitrādi full-moon ending calendar. The Āsādhi calendar begins with Aṣādha śukla 1, and the Kārtiki calendar with Kārtika śukla 1. 

The table (No. 20 on p. 249) shows the scheme of the different calendars for the year śaka 1875 (1953-54). The year contains a māla or adhika month. 

It may be seen from the above mentioned table that in case of the light half of the month (sudi half) the month has the same name for the two systems of month-reckonings, but in the dark half of the month 

(vadi half) the names of the months in the two systems are different. 

The year-beginnings of the Samvat era in the three systems of luni-solar calendar are also different, as may be seen from the following table.

RAPORT OF THE CALENDAR BEFORM COMMITTEE 

Counting of the Succession of Days, In all the calendars used in India, days are counted according to the solar reckoning, as well as according to the lunar reckoning (i.e. by tithi or lunar day). But there is a difference in emphasis. 

adhika'. For example if the third tithi is - repeated, then the sequence of days of the half-month would be 

1, 2, 3, 3 adhika, 4, etc. 

Some improvement in the use of tithi for dating purposes is, however, observed in the Fusli calendar in vogue in some parts of Northern India. In this calendar the month begins from the day following the full-moon and dates are counted consecutively from 1 to 29 or 30 without any break at new-moon, or any gapping or over-lapping of dates with kṣaya tithi or adhika tithi. In fact the dates of this calendar have no connection with tithis after the starting of the month has been determined. The year of Fusli begins after the full-moon day of lunar Bhadra 

e 

In the eastern regions (Bengal, Orissa and Assam), and in Tamil Nad and Malabar, the solar reckoning is given more prominence. The almanacs give solar months and count the days serially from 1 to 29, 30, 31 or 32 as the case may be. · The tithi endings are given for every day, and the tithi may start at any moment of the day. 

In other parts of India (except Bengal, Orissa, Assam and Tamil Nad), the counting of days is based on the lunar reckoning, and the number of the tithi current at sunrise is used as the ordinal number of the date necessary in civil affairs. So there are 29 or 30 days in a month, but the days are not always counted serially from 1 to 29 or 30. 

The month in the lunar calendar is divided into two half-months, the sudi and vadi halves in the new moon ending system, and the radi and sudi halves in the full-moon ending system. In fact the year is divided into 24 half-months instead of 12 months. So there are 14 to 15 days in a half-month (vide Table 20). 

The tithi or lunar day. is measured by the positions of the moon and the sun. When they are in conjunc tion, i.e., at new-moon the 30th tithi or amāvasyā ends and the first tithi starts which continues upto the moment when the moon gains on the sun by 12° in longitude. Similarly when the difference between the moon and the sun is 24o the second tithi ends, and so on. The average duration of a tithi is 236 37.m6, but the actual duration of a particular tithi undergoes wide variations from the above average according to the different positions of the sun, the moon and the lines of their apsides. . It may become as great as 266 47m and as small as 19h.59m. So generally to every day there is a tithi. But sometimes a tithi begins and ends on the same civil day, and such a tithi is dropped ; and some religious ceremonies of auspicious character are not allowed to take place on such a tithi, and the following day begins with the next following tithi. For example, if the third tithi is dropped, the sequence of days of the half-month is 1, 2, 4, 5 etc., thus the serialitas broken here. 

As opposed to the above-mentioned case, the tithi sometimes extends over two days, there being no tithi ending in a day (from sunrise to next sunrise). As the same tithi remains current on two successive sunrises, the same tithi-number is allotted to both the days ; In the second day, however, it is suffised by the term 

Mala Masa and Købaya Masa It has been stated befcre that even at the beginning of the Siddhānta Jyotiṣa period, the intercalary months (mala or adhika) were determined on the basis of the mean motions of the sun and the moon, and as such there was no possibility of the occurrence of any so called kṣaya or decayed month. But as already mentioned, from about 1100 A.D., the intercalary months are being determined on the basis of the true motions of the luminaries, s.e., on the actual lengths of the new-moon-ending lunar month and of the different solar months as obtained from Siddhāntic rules. This gave rise to the occurrence of kṣaya months, and the intercalary months were also placed at very irregular intervals. 

The period from new-moon to new-moon (the lunar month ) is not a period of fixed duration ; it varies within certain limits according to the different positions of the apse line of the lunar and solar orbits, as follows :

Comparing these values with the actual lengths of solar months given in Table 24, it is observed that the minimum length of the lunar month falls short of all the solar months, even of the shortest month of Pausa. But as a mala māsa is not possible in that month, the maximum and minimum limits of the lunar months are recalculated for each of the solar months from Kartika to Phālguna separately, INDIAN CALENDAR

Comparing the above limits with the actual leagths of months stated before, it is found that the minimum length of the lunar month falls short of all the solar months except Pauṣa. So a malamasa or intercalary month is possible in all the months. except the mouth! of Pausa only.

The maximum duration of a lunar month, on the other hand, exceeds the lengths of the solar months only in case of solar Agrahāyanan Pausa and Māgha. So a kṣaya month is possible only in these three months.

According to the Siddhāntic rules, the lunar calendar is pegged on to the solar calendar, and so it is the luni-solar calendar with which we are at present concerned. It has already been shown that the length of the Sūrya Siddhānta year is greater than the year of the seasons (i.e., the tropical year) by about 24 minutes. As a result of this the seasons have
