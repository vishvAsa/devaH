The Zero-point of the Hindu Zodiac i By this is meant have been given taking the position of the. V.E. point at the the Vernal Equinoctial Point (first point of Aries) at the Observer's time as the fiducial point. It is : possible to time when the Hindu savants swibobed on from the old locate it, 48 Burgess had shown in his edition of the 8.8., if Vedāriga-Jyōtiṣa calondar to the Siddhānitio calendar (let with the aid of the data given, d; i.o., celestial longitude of us call this the spoch of the Siddhānta-Jyōtiṣa or S.

REPOBT OF TEE OALUNDIR BEFORM COMMITTEE 

of Libra, the epooh comes out to be 286 A.D., and the. corresponding Vornal point 2° to the west of Ptolemy's. 

This analysis shows that the Indian astronomers had arrived at the idea that the equidoctial point should be properly located with reference to some standard stars and there were probably three attempts, one about 286 A.D., the next about 500 A.D., and the last one about 570. A,D. They had not accepted the first point given by Ptolemy or any western astronomer. 

The compiler (or compilers) of the S.S. was clearly anconscious of the procession of equinoxes, and while in his .. report, he made a selection of these da tau, he did not perceiro that they were inconsistent with the idea of a fixed V.E. point. 

But he did not err on the fandamental point. He had clearly laid down that Meṣādi, i.e., the first point of Aries from which the year was to be started was to be identified with the vernal equinootial point.. 

It is to be noticed that though the laker of the 8. 

B us absorbed many of the ideas from Greek astronomy including the use of technical terms like horā, liptikā, kendra, etc., ho did not either blindly copy the Graeco-Chaldean data. From whichever source he might have got the ideas. he absorbed it correctly and made an attempt to fix up the actual V.E point, as required in Chaldean astronomy, otherwise his zero-point would have been coincident with Ptolemy's. We have shown that whatever the Hindu zero-point of the zodiac might be, it is not coincident with that of Ptolemy.
