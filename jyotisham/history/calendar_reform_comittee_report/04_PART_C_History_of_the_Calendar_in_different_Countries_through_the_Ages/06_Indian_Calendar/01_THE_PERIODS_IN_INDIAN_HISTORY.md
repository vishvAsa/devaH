title = "01 THE PERIODS IN INDIAN HISTORY"

+++
The time-periods in Indian history necessary for our purpose are shown in the Chronological Table. 

The earliest civilization so far discovered in India is the Harappa-Mohenjo-Daro civilization (sometimes also called the Indus-Valley civilization) named after the two ancient buried cities of Harappa in the Punjab and Mohenjo-Daro in Sind. They were first brought to light by the late R.D. Banerjee, Superinten dent of the Western Circle of Archaeology of India in 1924. · It has now been ascertained that this civilization extended right upto Rupar on the Sutlej in the east and to the Narmada valley in the south. This civilization was certainly contemporaneous with the Mesopotamian civilizations of about 2500 B.C., nearly 500 years before the city of Babylon had risen to supremacy amongst the cities of Sumer and Akkad ; and with the first dynastic civilization of Egypt. How far back it projected into the time-scale is not yet known, but certainly many thousand years back. 

From the material records of the Indus-valley civilization, it is obvious that the Harappa-Mohenjo Daro people had attained to as high a standard of civilization, if not higher, as the contemporary people of Iraq and Egypt. But the script has not yet been deci phered ; it is therefore difficult to give a chronological history, but it is not so difficult to make a study of the attainments of this civilization is arts and sciences ; they could build well planned cities, used a drainage system superior to that of contemporary Egypt or Iraq, used copper and bronze, and had evidently evtoved a highly complex social organization. 

All civilized communities have been found to have evolved accurate systems of weights and measures and -some kind of calendar for the regulation of social life. We have some evidences of the use of standard weights and measures in the Indus valley. 

But had they evolved a calendar ? The presump tion is that they must have, but nothing has yet been discoverd amongst the artefacts left by these people so far recovered by the Archaeological Survey which tbrows light on the..calendar, or the system of time measurement they used 

It is held on quite sound grounds that the Harappa Mohenjodaro people were succeeded in the Punjab and in the valley of the now lost Sarasvatī river by the Aryan people who were either autochthonous or more probably came through Afghanistan in single or successive streams between 2500 B.C. and 1500 B.C. Others would go further back in time-scale from certain astronomical evidences. 

Few, almost none of the material records or artefacts of the early Aryans except some potteries tentatively ascribed to them, have so far been discovered. Almost the whole of our knowledge about them are derived from the hymns of the Rg-Vedas which were composed by priestly families amongst them in an archaic form of Sanskrit (Vedic Sanskrit), in honour of the gods they worshipped ; in these hymns are found occasional references to the sun, the moon, certain stars, and to months and seasons. Some think that there are also references to planets, i.e., the Vedic Aryans could distinguish between fixed stars and planets, but this is doubtful. From certain references which we discuss in § 5.2, we may conclude that they used an empirical luni-solar calendar. Probably this was used till 1300 B.C. We do not come across sufficient material records until we come to the time of Asoka about 270 B.C. 

What was the calendar during the period 1330 B.C.-250 B.C.? The Yajur Veda, the Brāhmaṇas, the Upaniṣads and other post Rg-Vedic literature, and the early Buddhistic literature contain occasional astronomical references, from which the nature of the calender used for ceremonical and other purposes can be inferred. The interpretation of the texts is neither easy, nor unambiguous. The latter part of this period has been called by S. B. Dikṣit, our pioneer in calendar research, as the Vedānga Jyotiṣa period. This is discussed in § 5.4. 

The Vedanga Jyotiṣa calendar appears to have been almost completely free from foreign influence, though this point of view has been contested. The Persian conqueror Darius conquered Afghanistan, and Gandhar, about 518 B.C. ; this region appears to have continued under the Achemenids for nearly two centuries. The Achemenids used a solar calendar probably adopted from Egypt in contrast to the luni-solar calendar of India, but this does not appear to have disturbed the indigenous luni-solar calendarical system. 

The Vedanga Jyotiṣa period, which as we shall show, was continued by Indian dynasts up to the time of the Satavahanas (200.A.D.), was succeeded by the Siddhānta Jyotiṣa period, but the first record of this period is available only about 400 A.D. "The transitional period from 100 A.D. to 400 A.D. is one of the . darkest periods in Indian chronology. Due to successive invasions by Macedonian and Bactrian Greeks ( Yavanas ), Parthians (Pallavas ), śaka's and Kuṣānas, the period from 300 B.C. to 200 A.D. is one of large foreign contacts which profoundly modified Indian life in arts, sciences, sculpture and state-craft. But the history of this period was entirely forgotten and is being recovered bit by bit from inscriptions, foreign references, and from artefacts recovered in excavations of the sites occupied by invaders of this period. Let us give a bird's eye view of the history of this period, imperfect as it is, so that the reader may follow without strain our account of the transition of the Vedanga Jyotiṣa calendar to Siddhāntic calendar. 

In 323 B.C., Alexander of Macedon raided the Punjab, but this incident by itself had no such profound influence on Indian life as is generally made out. Its influence was rather indirect. In India, it gave rise to a great national movement of unification under Candragupta and Canakya. In the former empire of Darius, it gave rise to a number of Greek states which became the focus of radiation of Greek culture throughout the East. The most important were Egypt under the rule of the Ptolemies, with capital at Alexandria, and the Near East under the Seleucids with capital at Babylon, which was succeeded a few years later by Seleucia a few miles distant from later Baghdad. In 306 B.C., Candragupta ind Seleucus faced each other, but the Greek army was rolled back to the borders of modern Iran, and almost the whole of modern Afghanistan except Bactria (modern Balkh) constituting the four satrapies of the old Persian empire were ceded to India. They continued to be politically and culturally parts of India till the tenth century A.D. 

(175-150 B.C.), who controlled the whole of Iran and wrested Bactria from the line of Eukratidas in 138 B.C. 

But inspite of these political happenings, Greek remained the language of culture throughout the whole Near East, from Asia Minor to North-Western. India. The Parthians since 128 B.C. called themselves 'Philhellens' or lover of Greek culture and used Greek on their coins, and the Graeco-Chaldean method of date-recording on their inscriptions. But about 140 B.C., a new power was on the move, viz., the Sakas from Central Asia ; they began to emerge as a ruling race from about 138 B.C. In 129 B.C. they attacked Bactria, and by 123 B.C. they wrested it completely out of the Parthian empire, after defeating and killing on the battlefield two successive Parthian emperors, vix., Phraates II (128 B.C.) and Artabanus I (123 B.C.). 

The early Śakas appear from their coins to have been under the spell of Greek civilization, and used Greek as a language of culture and put motifs taken from Greek mythology on their coins. Pressed by the next Parthian emperor, Mithradates II (123—90 B.C.), they poured by 80 B.C.,. into the whole of what is modern Afghanistan, except the Kabul valley, which the Greeks held for sometime. Their new territory became known as "Sakasthan' comprising modern Afghanistan and parts of N.W. India. From Afghanistan, they poured in successive streams to Malwa, Guzrāt, Taxila about 70 B.C., and to Mathura, somewhat later and had put an end to the numerous Greek principalities in the Punjab. Their further progress was barred by the Satavahanas in the South, and numerous small kingdoms which arose in the Gangetic valley on the break-up of the Sunga and Kanva empires (45 A.D.). After 50 A.D., the Sakas of the North were supplanted by the Kuṣānas belonging to a kindred race, and speaking the śaka language ; they ruled Northern India from their. capitals at Peshawar and Mathurā up to at least 170 A.D. Contemporaneously with them, were the śaka Satrap houses of Ujjain, who started ruling from about first century of the Christian era. 

. A chart of these historical incidents is attached for the sake of elucidation as they are necessary for the comprehension of the extent and amount of Greek culture, which was propagated into India, not so much through the Greeks directly, but as it appears now, indirectly through the early Śakas and their successors, the Kuṣānas. 

It now appears very probable that it was during the regime of the śaka and Kozana rulers (100 B.C. 200 A.D.) that a knowledge of the Graeco-Chaldean astronomy, which had developed in the Grecian world after 300 B.C. and ended with the astronomer 

The Mauryas kept out the Greeks till 186 B.C., when on the break-up of their empire, the Greek settlers in Bactria who had revolted from their overlords, the Seleucids, began to make inroads into India. There were two rival Greek houses, the earlier, the Euthydemids who under Demetrius and Menander (175 B.C.) took possession of the Punjab and Sind between 180 B.C. to 150 B.C. and threatened even Pataliputra but were rolled back beyond the Jamuna by the Sungas ; the line of Eukratidas who ousted Demetrius and his line from Bactria and Afghanistan propter about 160 B.C., reigned in Afghanistan up to 50 B.C. But there rose about 226. B.C., a great barrier between the Eastern Greeks (Bactrians and Indian Greeks) and the Western Greeks in the shape of the Parthian empire (248 B.C.), which became very powerful under Mithradates I

Ptolemy (150 A.D.), and in the Near East under the Seleucids (300 B.C. to 100 A.D.), penetrated into India, being brought by astronomers belonging to the śaka countries, who later were absorbed into Indian society as Śakadvipi or Scythian Brahmins. The borrowings appear to be more from Seleucid Babylon than from the west. The knowledge of Graeco Chaldean astronomy was the basis on which the calendar prescribed by the Surya Siddhānta and other Siddhāntas were built up. It completely replaced the former Vedānga Jyotiṣa calendar and by about 400 A.D, when the Vedānga Jyotiṣa calendar had completely disappeared from all parts of India. 

From 400 A.D. to 1200 A.D., almost the whole of India used calendars based on Siddhānta Jyotiṣa for date-recording. All Indian astronomers used the śaka era for purposes of accurate calculations, but its use for date-recording by kings and writers was generally confined to parts of the South. In general, the Indian dynasties used eras of their own, or regnal years, though the annual calendar was compiled according to rules laid down either in the Surya Siddhānta, the Arya Siddhānta or the Brahma Siddhānta. These did not much differ in essentials. 

When India since 1200 A.D. fell under Islamic domination, the rulers introduced the lunar Hejira calendar for civil and administrative purposes as well. Indian calendars were retained only in isolated localities where Hindus happened to maintain their ndependence, or used only for religious purposes. The emperor Akber in 1584 tried to suppress the Hejira calendar for administrative purposes by the Tarikh-Ilahi, a modified version of the solar calendar of. Iran, but this fell in disuse from about 1630., Since the advent of British rule in 1757, the Gregorian calendar has been used for civil and administrative purposes, which is still being continued. 

We have attempted to give below short accounts of calendars in use in different epochs of history. 

comprising the four Vedas : The Rk, Sara, Yajus, and Atharva. 

. (b) The Brāhmaṇas which are prose texts contai. 

· ning theological matter, particularly observations on 

sacrifices and their mystical significances ; attached to the Brāhmaṇas, but reckoned also as independent works are the Aranyakas or Upaniṣads containing meditations of forest hermits and ascetics on God, the world, and mankind. These treatises are attached to each of the individual Vedas. 

(c) The Sutras or Aphorisms, or Vedangas. 

Vedāngas', lit. limbs of Vedas, are post-Vedic Sūtra or aphorism literature which grew as results of attempts to understand the Vedas in their various aspects, and sometimes to develop the ideas contained in the Vedas. According to the orthodox view, there are six Vedāngas as follows: 

(1) Śikṣā : or phonetics; texts explaining how the Vedic literature proper is to be pronounced, and memorized. 

(2) Kalpa : or ritualistic literature, of which four types are known : Srauta Sutras dealing with sacrifices ; Grhya Sutras dealing with domestic duties of a householder ; Dharma Sūtras dealing with religious and social laws; Sūlva Sūtras dealing with the construction of sacrificial altars. 

(3) Vyakarana i or Grammar, e.g., Panini's famous Aṣtādhyāyī, which once for all fixed up the Sanskrit language. The Aṣtādhyāyi is however the culmination of attempts by large number of older authors, whose works were rendered obsolete by Panini' masterpiece. 

(4) Nirukta or Etymology: explanation of the Vedic words ascribed to one Yaska, who lived before Pānini. 

(5) Chandas-Metrics ascribed to Pingala. 

(6) Jyotiṣa-Astronomy: the Rg-Jyotiṣa is ascribed to one Lagadha, of whom nothing is known. 

Only the sixth Vedanga or Jyotisa interests us, though there are occasional references to the calendar in all Sātra literatures.
