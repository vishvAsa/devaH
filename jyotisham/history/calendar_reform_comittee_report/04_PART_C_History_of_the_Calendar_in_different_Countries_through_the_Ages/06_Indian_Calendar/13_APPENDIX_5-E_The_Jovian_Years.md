(Bārhaspatya Varṣa) 

The sidereal period of Jupiter, according to the surya Siddhānta is 4332.32 days which is nearly 11.86 sidereal years. Therefore Jupiter roughly stays for one year in one zodiacal sign, if we calculate by mean motion. 

This was taken advantage of to devise & cycle of 12 Jovian years. If we divide the Sūrya Siddhānta period by 12, we get 361.026721 days which is takon as the length of & Jovian year. This is 4.232 days less than the Sūrya Siddhānta solar year. So if & Jovian year and an ordinary solar year begin on the same day, the Jovian year will begin to fall back, completing a complete retrogression in 8501solar years, according to the Sūrya-Siddhānta. 

. The sixty-year cycle is at present'in daily use in Southern 

India (south of Narmada) where each year (the solar year or the luni-solar year) is named after that of the corresponding Jovian year. The years are counted there in regular succes sion and no samvatsara is expunged. This practice is being followed since about 905-06 A.D. (827 śaka), as a result of wbich the number of North-Indian Samvatsara has been gradually gaining over that of the South from that time. The śaka year 1876 (1954-55 A.D.) is named 41 Plavanga in the North while in the South it is 28 Jaya.

year is expunged in every 85 

years. The expunged year 

is called the Kṣaya year. In actual practice, the interval between two expunctions is sometimes 85 and sometimes 86 years. 

There was indeed at one time a period of 12 Jovian years, but at some past epoch, a fivefold multiple, a cycle of 60 Jovian years, each with a special name suffixed by the word 'Samvatsara', came into use. 

The following are the names of the different years : (1) Prabhava (21) Sarvajit (41) Plavaiga (2) Vibbaya (22) Sarvadhārin (42) Kila ka (3) śukla · (23) Virodhin (43) Saumya (4) Pramoda (24) Viksta (44) Sādhāraṇa (5) Prajāpati (25) Khara (45) Virodhakrt (6) Angiras (26) Nandana (46) Paridhāvin (7) Srimukha (27) Vijaya (47) Pramādin. (8) Bhava (28) Jaya (48) Ananda (9) Yuvan (29) Manmatha (49) Rākṣasa (10) Dhātri (30) Durmukha (50) Anala (Nala) (11) Iśvara (31) Hemalamba (51) Pingala (12) Bahudhānya (32) Vilamba (52) Kālayukta (13) Pramāthin (33) Vikārin (53) Siddhārthin. (14) Vikrama (34) Sarvari (54) Raudra (15) Vrga (35) Plava (55) Durmati (16) Chitrabhānu (36) Subhakrt (56) Dundubhi (17) Subhānu (37) śobbana (57) Rudhirodgārin (18) Tāraṇa (38) Krodhin (58) Raktākṣa (19) Pārthiva (39) Viśvāvasu (59) Krodhana (20) Vyaya (40) Parābhava (60) Kṣaya (Aksaya) 

The beginning of the Jovian years is determined by the entry of Jupiter into an Indian sign by mean motion, the 1st, 13th, 25th, 37th and 49th years being marked by the entry of Jupiter into the sign Kumbha, and not Meṣa which is otherwise the first of the signs of the Siddhāntas. It thus appears that the system of counting Jovian years is a pre-Siddhāntic practice
