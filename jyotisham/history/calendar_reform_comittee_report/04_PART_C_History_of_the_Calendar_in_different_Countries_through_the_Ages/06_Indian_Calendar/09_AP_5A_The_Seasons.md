We have seasons because the celestial equator is oblique The amount of daylight received at any place determines to the sun's path (or the ecliptic), or in modern parlanoo, the season. When we have maximum sunlight, we have the axis of rotation of the earth is not perpendioular to its the bot season. When we have minimum sunlight, we shall orbit, but inclined at an angle of 661. This causes varying have winter. The other seasons come in-between. Bain, amounts of sunlight to fall on a particular locality through frost, etc., are secondary effects produced by varying out the year. If the earth's axis were perpendicular to the amounts of sunlight, and of the atmospherio conditions ecliptic, in other words the obliquity were zero, overy stimulated by the sunlight received. The sun is the sole portion of the earth from the equator to the pole would Srbiter of the seasons. have had 12 hours of sunlight, and- 12 hours of shade. Hence the definitions of seasons as given by the ancient There would have been no seasons on any part of the earth, astronomers, whether Western and Indian, which base them just as we have now for places on the earth's equator, whore on the cardinal days of the year, are the only correct, we have no variation of geason throughout the year, because definitions.

correctly. It is now known that they all used the gnomon. Measures of the length of the different seasons and of the year by some of their eminent astronomers are given in the table (No. 30) below. 

The Chaldeans must have also measured the length: of the year by the same method, either somewhat earlier or simultaneously with the early Greeks, but their names, excepting those of a few have not survived. But if in reality, the nineteen-year cycle was of as early as 747 B.C., they must have arrived at & correct length of the year much earlier than any other nation. 

The Length of the Seasons : The lengths of geasons were found exactly in the same way as in the case of the year, e.g., in the case of Spring, by counting the number of days from the day next to the vernal equinox day to the summer solstice day. The number would be variable from year to year, but a correct value was found by taking the observations for a number of years and taking the mean. The lengths obtained by early astronomers &re :

The month names in the last column of table (No. 29) are ‘lunar', bụt they were linked to the solar months. They are now in universal use all over India to donote solar as well as lunar months ; but the two varieties are distinguished by the adjectives 'Solar' or 'Lunar'. 

Both the European and Indian definitions of seasons are scientific as they are based on the cardinal days. The difference in nomenclature is trivial.

The ancients early discovered that the seasons were of unequal length, but they were ignorant of the physical reasons. These exact definitions of seasons, both in India and in the West, were arrived at very early, and are very important for accurate calendar-making ; but the true meaning of those definitions were forgotten in the succeed ing periods in India. 

In Europoan astronomy, which is derived from Graeco Chaldean astronomy, we have : 

Spring 0° - 90° from V.E, to 8.8. Summer 90°-180° .8. to ANE. Autumn 180°—270° A.E. to W.8. 

Winter 270°—360° • W.8. to V.E. According to this scheme, the Rainy season consisting of months of Nabhas and Nabhasya formally set in when 

The Length of the Year : The length of the year, as mentioned earlier, must have been found by counting the number of days from one equinox to another, or one solstice 'to another. 

In actual practice, the number of days of the year, counted in this way would vary between 365 and 366. In the early stages, the length of the year was whole-numbered, but Indians of Vedāng& Jyōtiṣa period had a year of: 366 days. Later when they came to a rigorous definition of the year, they realized that the number of days was not whole, but involved fractions.. Probably the attempt at determin ing the exact length of the year involving fractional numbers was obtained by adding up the lengths for & number of years, and taking the mean.
