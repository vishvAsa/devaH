## 4500 BCE - Equinox at mRgashIrSha/ prajApati
- "प्रजापतेर् यत् सहजम् पुरस्तात्"।

## 3000 BCE - Vernal equinox at rohiNI 
- Corresponds to phAlguna full moon being first month of the year/ uttarAyANArambha. Mentioned in jaiminIya brAhmaNa, kauShItakI brAhmaNa. See [saura-chAndra-mAna](../saura-chAndra-mAnam/) page for details.
- mantra of vAmadeva gautama to agni: sa jAyata prathamaH pastyAsu maho budhne rajaso asya yonau | apAd ashIrShA guhamAno antAyoyuvAno vR^iShabhasya nILe || = (RV 4.1.11) In dwellings first he came into being, at great base [of heaven], and in this atmosphere’s womb; Footless and headless, concealing both his ends, drawing himself together in the bull’s station. ("The first hemistich refers to the 3 manifestations of agni: the ritual fire, the celestial fire and the atmospheric fire. Here, as Santillana and von Dechend argued in the Hamlet’s Mill the heavenly fire (vaishvAnara) is associated with the equinoctial colure: This is implied in this mantra by the statement that his ends come together – i.e. the ecliptic ends meet and this happens in the station of the bull.")

## 2300 BCE - Vernal equinox at kRttikA 
- Vernal equinox was at actual kRttikA in 2300 BCE - yajurveda period (described elsewhere).
- Corresponds to daxiNAyanArambha in maghA and uttarAyaNArambha in mAgha. See [saura-chAndra-mAna](../saura-chAndra-mAnam/) page for details.
    - shaunaka atharvaveda 19.7 nakShatra sUktam भानुराश्लेषा अयनं मघा मे : sun \[in\] AshleSha(=sarpa), \*solistice\* \[in\] maghA for me.
        सुहवमग्ने कृत्तिका रोहिणी चास्तु | agnI well-invoked in kR^ittikA: setting of fires in kR^ittkA
- सूचिकाग्निसूक्तम् ऋग्वेदे दृश्यताम् - [महत् तदुल्बम्](../../../mantraH/agniH/Rk/mahat_tad_ulbam/) इति।
- वायुपुराणात् - 
  - मेषान्ते च तुलान्ते च भास्करोदयतः स्मृताः । मुहूर्त्ता दश पञ्चैव अहोरात्रिश्च तावती ।। ५०.१९५ ।। कृत्तिकानां यदा सूर्यः प्रथमांशगतो भवेत् । विशाखानां तथा ज्ञेयश्चतुर्थांशे निशाकरः।। ५०.१९६ ।। विशाखायां यदा सूर्यश् चरतेंऽशं तृतीयकम्। तदा चन्द्रं विजानीयात् कृत्तिकाशिरसि स्थितम् ।। ५०.१९७ ।। विषुवन्तं तदा विद्यादेवमाहुर्महर्षयः। सूर्येण विषुवं विद्यात् कालं सोमेन लक्षयेत् ।। ५०.१९८ ।।

## 1400 BCE solistice at shraviShThArdha
- Summer solistice at magha and winter solistice at shraviShTha (~ full moon at maghA)
- मैत्रायणीयोपनिषदि - "द्वादशात्मकं वत्सरम्। एतस्याग्नेयमर्धम्, अर्धं वारुणं। मघाद्यं श्रविष्ठार्धमाग्नेयं क्रमेण, +उत्क्रमेण सार्पाद्यं श्रविष्ठार्धान्तं सौम्यम्" "solisticial points here are indicated as maghAdyam|sarpAdyam+++(=their boundary)+++ and shraviShTArdham. this would approximately correspond to ~1300 BCE marking a change from the earlier reference to solisticial point lying inside magha in AV nakShatrasUkta"\[[SD](https://sanskritdocuments.org/doc_upanishhat/maitri.html?lang=sa), [MT_TW](https://twitter.com/blog_supplement/status/984634039909978112), [IMG](https://i.imgur.com/rNhFPph.jpg)\]
- Corresponds to equinox at bharaNI.

## 1300 BCE - Solstice : shraviShThAdi
- "Dating by precession gives the date of the VJ as being around 1300 BC because the it states that the winter solistice was in the beginning for shraviShThA and summer in the mid-point of AshleShA. This is important because in the maitrAyaNi brAhmaNa, shAkhAyanya tells king bR^ihadratha that the winter solistice was in the middle of shraviShThA (MBU 6.14). Thus, the lagadha was clearly aware of the change from the epoch time little before his times. "

## 1000 BCE - Summer solstice at AshreShA (shrAvaNa monsoons)
- वेदाङ्गज्योतिषे - "प्रपद्येते श्रविष्ठादौ सूर्याचन्द्रमसावुदक् । सार्पार्धे दक्षिणार्कस्तु माघश्रावणयोः सदा ।।"
    - तदा नाक्षत्रिकाव् ऽपि मासौ माघश्रावणौ।
- This also corresponds to shrAvaNI pUrNimA being around summer solstice (~ the time of Apastamba gRhya sUtra-s, see [ayanAMshachayanam](../../naxatram/chAndra-naxatram/04_ayanAMshachayanam/) page).
- "We have a text of the nagna nAstika-s, termed sUrya-praj~nApti, where the same system of calenderics as the VJ is expounded. But the jaina-s correct the winter solstice to shravaNa, suggesting that they were after the VJ in the period when you would actually expect the jaina-s to be around. Thus, we have a continuous system of precessional corrections even in the period around the VJ, leave alone the vedic antiquity."
- Vernal equinox was likely *before* actual ashvinI during taittirIya-AraNyaka period "नक्षत्राणि रूपम्, अश्विनौ व्यात्तम्" ([MT1](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2013/11/08/anatomy-and-heavens-in-the-boomorphic-universe/), आरण्यके [ऽत्र](https://archive.org/stream/taittiriya/taittiriya_aranyaka_bhaskara_01#page/n309/mode/2up))
    - "Here Nārāyaṇa is identified with the constellations even as Prajāpati was earlier identified with them in the ritual of the Nakṣatra-rūpin Prajāpati specified in the Yajurveda (Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa 1.5.2.2). This identification continues through later Vaiṣṇava tradition. ... The text is clearly a late one clinging to the edge of the Vaidika productions but when exactly was it composed. If one takes Aśvayujau to imply the start of the nakṣatra cycle having shifted to this asterism it would yield a date of around 2300 YBP. This date resonates with the white Indologists who ascribe late dates to all Vedic production. However, we do not think the mouth should be taken as the beginning of the nakṣatra cycle. Rather, that position is usually reserved for the top of the head. Hence, the mouth likely implies the nakṣatra after it which might imply the equinoctial coelure passing before Aśvayujau suggesting a date of around 3300-3000 YBP. (equinox at bharaNI)" [MT1](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2017/07/01/a-note-on-the-asterisms-forming-the-nak%e1%b9%a3atra-s/)

## 200 BCE - Vernal equinox at ashvinI
- "One also wonders if the tale of Prajāpati being fitted with a goat’s head after his beheading by Rudra’s agent Vīrabhadra alludes to this period, with the goat’s had representing Aries."
- "अश्विनौ व्यात्तम्" इत्यस्मिन् उपर्युक्तम्।
- Roughly corresponds to Spica/Citra (नक्षत्रम्, न तु तारा) at polar longitude 180°, and pushya at around 102 deg. Thence, is close to Lahiri ayanAmsha as of 2000-s.

## 550 AD - varAhamihira
- "the Hindu encyclopedist varAhamihira, who was an acute observer, writing around 550 AD states that the spring equinox fell 10′ East of Zeta Piscium in revatI."
