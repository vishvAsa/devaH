+++

The Gods are multiple (whether or not they arose from a single being before time). This is clear from the experience they granted to our ancestors the Arya-s - with different names, lores and rituals. There is no good reason to reduce them to "angels" or "demigods" or "facets" of the same entity - it suffices to acknowledge their [generality](../generality) and the provisional nature of their [myths](../myth). They may even be innumerable - with more Gods revealing themselves to us under changing spatio-temporal and social circumstances. Tradition holds that their number is large in comparison to everyday numbers.

## Primodial few
> We see that a given deva/devI might present themselves as multiple devatA-s. Thus, they are what may be termed prakR^iti-s. The most abstract of these prakR^iti-s are the ones that have an existence quite independent of humans or any such species & their shAstra-s. - MT

## Gods accross cultures and locations
Indra of the Indo-Arya-s is not necessarily the same as Zeus of the Greeks or Jupiter of the Romans - they may well have been offspring of the same God adored by our common ancestors. Just because two doctor brothers appear similar, it does not follow that they are the same. (Though their origin could be termed human-dependent, once born, they're for ever.) The same applies to "same" Gods at different locations \[example - [KV](https://agnimaan.wordpress.com/2017/12/16/polycentrism-the-clan-deity-case/)\].

That said, it is valid to approach new God shrines with reference to our experience with previous Gods. It is certainly possible for multiple Gods to be accessible from the very same icon/ portal - even if via the itermediary (mantresha) associated with the particular icon/ shrine. This is akin to multiple doctors sharing the same receptionist.

Also see notes on absorption of foreign deities at the [deity competition page](../hierarchy/cult-competition/). 

### Gods in new shrines
- Trinidad and Tobago
    - "Yet it was in 1995, during the celebration of Trinidad and Tobago’s 150th Anniversary of Indian Arrival Day that interested persons in India collected water and dust from two thousand sacred pilgrimage places along the Ganges and this was then brought to Trinidad in two urns specially made of several metals. The dust of nine sacred locations in Trinidad was also added and then, using a machine, a hole was pierced deep into a large slab of stone where the ancient design was interred. Then all was buried at a place (called the prayaag) where two rivers converged to form one, thereby consecrating the river. Thus was teerath created here, making the river officially and spiritually Ganga for local Hindus to come and worship at." [Triniview](http://www.triniview.com/blog/?p=575).
