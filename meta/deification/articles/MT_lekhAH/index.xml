      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the vaidika tradition it doesn&amp;rsquo;t take the same color as in later tradition. The great emperor trasadasyu is termed ardhadeva but only that. While deva &amp;amp; martya are distinct, the deva can assume any form for particular reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thus indra assumed the form of AkUpAra the gigantic tortoise. indra also appeared to medhAtithi kANva as a ram. indra took the form of the hyaena to conquer the asura-s. indra took the form of a gautama v1 to spy on the asura-s. viShNu took the form of a vAmana to conquer the dAnava-s. It also seems that it was understood that the boar that bore the Earth was viShNu. The gods might appear as birds to sit on the barhiSh to take the offerings.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
