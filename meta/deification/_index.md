## Apotheosis and divine incarnation
It is as if a (new?) God reveals himself subsuming some deeds and traits of a (dead?) human as part of his sacred myth.

> Heroes in the cultic sense were by no means necessarily "heroic" in the modern, colloquial sense, but uncanny, beginning as the restless dead, becoming something more in a cultic dialogue with the community. - EP Butler .  

### Hindu
- In the hindu traditions raising humans to a divine level has oft happened.
- Recent ancestors and sages are treated as de-facto deva-s with supernatural powers. brAhmaNa-s are described as bhU-sura-s; cows and certain plants are venerated.
- Some bhakta-s are said to be raised to the level of protector deities \[eg nandin, chaNdesha, bhR^i~NgiriTi, kubera - [TW](https://twitter.com/blog_supplement/status/841857310012112896)\]
