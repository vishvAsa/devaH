## Infinite pool of shivas

> every soul is innately *a* Śiva. This is the final state for all of those beings who are irreversibly on the path to mukti. Yes, we can attain it too. And we attain it by the grace of *the* Śiva... As mahāmuni sadyojyoti makes it clear, the soul is essentially sarvavyāpī. As far as I understand, aṇutvam is experienced due to mala.

> ... In any case, ananta is bound to get liberated with all other vidyeśvaras at the end of mahāpralaya. And since universes are created & dissolved beginninglessly, mahāpralayas too have been occurring eternally. Now this leads to the last conclusion. So, not only an eternal divine multiplicity is necessitated by the sheer nature of reality but the siddhānta now goes one step further & necessitates an infinite pool of Śivas coexisting with *the* Śiva since eternity, who are taught to be equal to him & lordless like him.

## Speciality of the Shiva
- "the only difference between these Śivas and *the* Śiva would be that the latter was never in samsara. .." As the tattvaprakāśa famously states: “muktātmāno'pi śivāḥ kintvete tatprasādato muktāḥ | so 'nādimukta eko vijñeyaḥ pañcamantratanuḥ”.

## Harmony among the Shiva-s
> The reason why the problem of conflicting īśvara-s doesn’t arise is because unlike *the* Śiva who has been doing pañcakrtyāni (5 acts: creation, etc) spontaneously like breathing since eternity, (unlike them) the ādimukta-s who have been liberated at a point in time have to desire to do such acts; but being liberated, they don’t have such desires or impulses.
