A God is not the sum total of these things but contains the said sum within. Those tiniest of ideas (i.e. the smallest change in detail in what one would call the &amp;rsquo;long evolution of a Deity&amp;rsquo; and more rarely, the substantial &amp;amp; &amp;ldquo;chunkier&amp;rdquo; conceptions (i.e. what we may call &amp;lsquo;revelation&amp;rsquo;) manifest to deserving individuals in their intellects as imagination or insight over the course of history.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Identifying alien forms</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1690014417344159746.html&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;identifying-with-non-arya-deities&#34;&gt;Identifying with non-Arya deities&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What I stated above, mutatis mutandis, applies to who we see as “Non-Sanskritic” Village deities as well. This deity was likely never known to the Ṛṣis or the Āryas of that time &amp;amp; perhaps was conceived much much later. But that deity of “Non-Ārya” provenance was all along a “husk” concealing a transcendental deity with whom we are much more familiar, who was waiting for us to discover this chain/layers of deities leading up to him. Who knows?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Irresistable Polytheism</title>
      <link>https://vishvAsa.github.io/devaH/meta/articles/GA/irresistable-polytheism/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1076832427010473985.html&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While I&amp;rsquo;m no expert, the essence of &amp;lsquo;polytheism&amp;rsquo; for me is that we see multiplicity intrinsic to the very concept of &amp;ldquo;god&amp;rdquo;. And against this simple criterion, the way the Hindu mind has seen plurality in the divine can only be described as insanely complex &amp;amp; beautiful. Others may point out some other &amp;ldquo;underlying unity&amp;rdquo; (nirguNabrahman, puruSa-prakRti as in sAMkhyA, etc). Yet, none of this metaphysical speculations have prevented the natural inclination of the Hindu mind to conceptualize &amp;amp; celebrate the diversity in the divine.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Philosophical-grounding</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1690014417344159746.html&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Religion needs common worship &amp;amp; ritual but a competing concern is that young gens across the world increasingly have a “standardised” sense of what they want from a religion &amp;amp; find it important to obtain a “profound/sophisticated” basis for popular rituals, lore/myths, etc.. (&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/granirau/status/1689099342118793216&#34;&gt;granirau&lt;/a&gt; )&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;daoist-trouble&#34;&gt;Daoist trouble&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A case in point is the situation of folkish Daoism in Sim̐hapurī (Daoism has a remarkably sophisticated cosmology, metaphysics &amp;amp; ritual but the way it is articulated &amp;amp; experienced in SG is what matters) vs that of Buddhism. Among all non-Abrahamic religions, in a very materialistic &amp;amp; increasingly “godless” generation of Chinese youth, Daoism as it is currently practiced - Stands zero chance of survival unless it attempts something drastic. Buddhism’s far more robust ability to provide “sophisticated” answers to “serious questions” leaves it in a far better place in a spiritually hostile climate.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Transcendentalization</title>
      <link>https://vishvAsa.github.io/devaH/meta/articles/GA/transcendentalization/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1690014417344159746.html&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As part of a response, one sees the following:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Village gods like Munīśvara have now been incorporated into mainstream pantheon as an extension of Śiva &amp;amp; there are four Āgamika temples devoted to him now.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Karuppaṇasvāmī (already underwent semi-“transcendentalization” in India when Śaiva Brāhmaṇa priests in TN came up with Āgamika installation rites for him a few centuries ago) keeps undergoing further such transcendentalization in TN &amp;amp; that’s slowly catching on in SG.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;While some may go over to ISKCON (which offers a fulfilment in terms of religious/spiritual expectations), since most are Śaiva/Śākta at heart, some are trying to explore Śaiva philosophical texts.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is no running away from any of this. A skilful theologian can easily explain how Karuppaṇasvāmī has evolved from a fierce, rural deity to a transcendental entity that is related to Śiva (or even Viṣṇu) or the Śaiva doorkeeper Mahākāla, in the same way Vināyakas in certain early texts meant something else. There is a multitude of layers (like in a fruit) or if you want another imagery, a “chain” of beings. The transcendental deity is of course the deepest &amp;amp; most hidden. But that doesn’t mean he is unrelated to the more “outer”, “primal” or “rustic” layers that our ancestors first experienced. There is an obvious link between these beings in the hierarchy &amp;amp; it’s not arbitrary. I won’t flesh it out here in full. Just providing a brief sketch.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
