If a God transcends time & is omniscient, He or She will contain within themselves all possible forms, syncretisms, lores, liturgies & rites, which "manifest" in human history over time in a gradual way that we call "evolution of ideas". 

Each and every "infinitesimal" snapshot of a God's meme as it would have originated in a priest's or seer's head throughout history, be it "imagination" or intuition, be it the deity's lore/ mythos, iconography, etc, has & always will exist in the God. A God is not the sum total of these things but contains the said sum within. Those tiniest of ideas (i.e. the smallest change in detail in what one would call the 'long evolution of a Deity' and more rarely, the substantial & "chunkier" conceptions (i.e. what we may call 'revelation') manifest to deserving individuals in their intellects as imagination or insight over the course of history.

To someone who believes in the pervasiveness of the Gods & divine will, there is not a significant difference between "God-made" & "man-made". "Man-made" becomes another mechanism through which the Gods' infinite potential manifests & becomes visible.
