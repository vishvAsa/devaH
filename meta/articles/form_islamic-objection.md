Anyway, this argument that his deity cannot assume a form “because it is a logical impossibility” is bs. Ahadith mention Adam being created in his deity’s image. This not only shows that his deity is not only not formless, but is also finite. 

If the response is that “this form is not comparable to anything in this world” it still doesn’t mean there is formlessness. In that case, H will respond (from scripture) that Bhagavān’s forms are not some imitation of creation, but is fashioned of Māyā which is His own Śakti. He takes these forms solely for the benefit of the bound souls. Refer to Bhojadeva’s Tattvaprakāśikā for this.

If they argue H deities are mythical, the logical response is, so is yours.
