      <title>Form - Islamic objection</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/pinakasena/status/1656054253797150731&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, this argument that his deity cannot assume a form “because it is a logical impossibility” is bs. Ahadith mention Adam being created in his deity’s image. This not only shows that his deity is not only not formless, but is also finite.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the response is that “this form is not comparable to anything in this world” it still doesn’t mean there is formlessness. In that case, H will respond (from scripture) that Bhagavān’s forms are not some imitation of creation, but is fashioned of Māyā which is His own Śakti. He takes these forms solely for the benefit of the bound souls. Refer to Bhojadeva’s Tattvaprakāśikā for this.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Form multiplicity</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1859665191849558477.html&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thread by @RangaTheDude&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is an interesting question. I&amp;rsquo;ll generalize the problem and attempt to provide a coherent answer from H insider POV.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Problem: If you accept the proposition that a deity you worship is a later day addition to H pantheon, and perhaps even inspired by a contact with foreign tribe, how can you continue to worship without slipping into cognitive dissonance?&#xA;@halleyji please let me know if I captured the problem reasonably accurately.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Nudity meaning</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Thread by @EPButler on Thread Reader App – Thread Reader App&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;nudity-of-aphrodite-hathor-bes-bat&#34;&gt;Nudity of Aphrodite, Hathor, Bes, Bat&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The nudity of Aphrodite is comparable to the frontality of depictions of Hathor, atypical for Egyptian Gods, the significance of which is likely the immediacy of Their manifestation, both being associated with beauty and pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hathor shares Her frontality with Bes, who is closely linked to Her in the Returning Goddess rites. (The image of Bes on the left comes from the great temple of Hathor at Dendera.) Hathor inherits Her frontal iconography from Bat, who we see in a Predynastic depiction at right. The name Bat (bA.t) seems to have the sense of &amp;ldquo;the one who is manifest&amp;rdquo;, supporting the idea that frontality symbolizes immediacy. Similarly, Bes delights the Returning Goddess, bringing Her to presence among Her people in festivals of inebriation and other pleasures.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

You&amp;rsquo;ve learned science. You know now that Amadioha does not command thunder. You simply cannot have the same relationship with it as your forbears who sincerely thought he did. So if you worship Amadioha unironically in 2024, I&amp;rsquo;ll tell you for free that the Amadioha you think you&amp;rsquo;re worshiping is not the same one your fathers did.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
