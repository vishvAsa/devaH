As others have noted before me, spirit (or deity) possession must be viewed from within the cultural systems of which it is a part. In such systems, as Loring Danforth points out, “people who are seriously disturbed are generally not able to express or resolve their idiosyncratic problems through the cultural symbols provided by the idiom of spirit possession.” Spirit possession is, therefore, “an adaptive response through which they are able to resolve social and psychological problems in a widely accepted, and sometimes well-respected, cultural idiom.”41 Thus the question of labeling spirit or deity possession a form of deviant behavior or psychologically definable pathology must be answered within the context of the local culture. This is no less true in South Asia than anywhere else. In spite of (or perhaps because of) a suspected (or suspect) normalcy, and because of the extensive time frame of the topic as I approach it here, it is necessary to engage in a fairly thorough review of the psychological and psychoanalytic interpretations of possession as I see them and their relevance to the topic at hand.

The defining feature of possession to both the possessed individual and the observer is marked psychological change that engenders recognizable modifications in speech and behavior. This is accompanied by an observable shift from one internal focal context to another and from one presumed identity to another. The operative assumption of nearly all scholars who favor psychoanalytic interpretations of possession is that the modifications are generated intrapersonally, strictly from within, the result of the psyche responding to stimuli that may be either internally or externally produced. If the latter, then the stimulus is regarded as secondary; in psychoanalysis the primary concern is to locate and analyze internal reactions and personality complexes that confer on the individual’s experience a unique and idiosyncratic flavor. Regardless, then, of whether an alleged experience of possession is said to result from interpersonal or any other extrapersonal contact (and nearly all of them are), the psychoanalytic project is to address internal psychic and psychological processes, usually released by external stimuli, that induce observable personality modifications.

Possession or external invasion has not been a productive psychoanalytic diagnosis, at least not until recently, because it opposes the assumption of the normalcy of an inviolable and unitary self, on which the Western biomedical system is founded. As much, however, as this philosophical reason for the denial of extrapersonal contact as the etiology of reported experiences of possession is that psychoanalysis (and, we should add, other social and “human” sciences), in the words of J. Moussaieff Masson, is “always skeptical of anagogic or ‘spiritual’ explanations, or of explanations in terms of what we cannot understand.”42 Part of the problem is that these sciences have established the parameters of what is understandable, and this creates an often unbridgeable rift between the science and the object of study. What eventually occurs, then, is that one explanatory model is replaced with another, which hardly solves the problem of communication between models.43

Nonetheless, psychologists and anthropologists who study possession are able to observe and even measure certain of its manifestations, such as altered speech and behavior, following which these investigators construct credible psychological and psychosocial narratives said to be responsible for these modifications.44 What observers, including ethnographers and (we choose to believe) indigenous participants, are unable to perceive are the alien spirits and deities reported to be taking possession of the individual and instigating these psychological and socially interactional changes. Thus most psychoanalytic interpretations either deny the possibility of possession (e.g., Lambek, see below) or leave the question unaddressed. The nature of these interpretations has become more sophisticated and nuanced over the years, though, as always, psychoanalytic interpretations continue to carry more than their fair share of cultural and intellectual biases.45

The three competing theoretical perspectives concerning spirit (and, we might add, deity) possession are Freud’s psychoanalytic theory, which regards possession as a form of hysteria, dissociation theory based on the work of Pierre Janet in the late nineteenth century, and the notion that possession is a culturally mediated altered state of consciousness. We deal with the third of these later; for the moment, it is important to understand that dissociation theory has always opposed Freud’s psychoanalytic theory. In the late nineteenth century most possession experience was regarded as dissociation. After rise of Freud in the early twentieth century, dissociation theory was eclipsed by psychoanalytic theory. A perusal of the different editions of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), published by the American Psychiatric Association (in four editions so far: 1952, 1968, 1980, and 1994), illustrates the changes in categorizing psychiatric disorders during the second half of the twentieth century. Initially psychoanalytic theory was ascendant. In the past few decades, however, there has been a shift toward viewing psychopathology “as a set of discrete heterogeneous disorders with distinct biological causations.”46 Along with this, dissociation theory has experienced a revival (for our purposes, note especially the work of Castillo and Littlewood, discussed shortly). At the same time, certain psychoanalytic categories have been completely expunged from the DSM, most recently neurosis and hysteria.47

Until the latter decades of the twentieth century, possession was usually explained by advocates of psychoanalytic theory as little more than a psychological state indicative of “repressed infantile complexes or a reconfirmation of primitive beliefs once surmounted,”48 as repressed oedipal desires in the unconscious, or even (in the case of spontaneous, nonritualized, possession) as compulsion, obsession, epilepsy, or hysteria.49 Although this may be an oversimplification, even a caricature, of most current psychoanalytic interpretations of possession, investigators throughout the twentieth century resorted to explanations that attributed reported possession experiences at least in part to abnormal psychological conditions or, if not abnormal, as culturally sanctioned psychological reactions to social or political oppression—in other words, as compensatory behavior. In either case, the reported “possession” was lightly regarded; rather, the experience was considered a psychic dimension of learned and conditioned behavior, founded on an ultimately fictive belief in possession.50 Stanley Tambiah attempts to interpret Indian notions of spirit possession from a standard psychoanalytic paradigm.
it is to be expected that the Indian view of mental illness would be incompatible with the Western approaches. In the Indian shamanistic or spirit possession beliefs, mental illness may be admitted to be related to undue or unfulfilled desires, but the results of such unfulfilled desires are not internally split-off portions of the self but are externalized entities given phenomenal existence as demons and spirits.51
Later we examine in detail the subject of bhūtavidyā (demonology) in classical Indian medical literature and how a diverse array of invasive spirits are believed to induce disease, especially in children.

Of more immediate concern, however, is to better understand the incompatibility of Indian and Western approaches of which Tambiah speaks. In short, the Western biomedical approach to physical and mental illness excludes the possibility of nonsensory forces influencing the individual’s consciousness. This consciousness, in the Western biomedical model, is a function of the mind, which is equated with and bounded by the brain. The proximate construction in Indian thought to this model of internal functioning is the “inner organ” (Skt. antaḥkartṇa), analyzed as the heart (as the locus of emotional experience), mind, intellect, and ego combined.52 This “inner organ,” however, is not immune to nonsensory influence, from infiltration by external signals. With respect to possession, unarguably an assertion of such nonsensory, external influence, Sudhir Kakar, for example, contends that what Indians regard as spirit possession is, in fact, nothing more than an interpretation. Kakar, perhaps the most literate apostle of Freud in the Indian psychoanalytic community, interprets possession as a self-induced mechanism for psychic release, consistent with the generalization stated above.

Kakar observed reported possession in Mehndipur in eastern Rajasthan, which contains a temple to Hanumān, called Bālājī, as well as several other facilities well known for exorcisms and other treatments for psychological disorders. The classic visible symptoms of possession, very much on display at Bālājī, suggested to Kakar that the evident somatic unburdening was caused by a culturally identifiable and sanctioned mode of psychic release, akin to classically defined hysteria but identified locally as a kind of possession. To Kakar, spirit possession is an act of situated imagination, the classic mechanism of projection.53 Another clinician, Dr. Antti Pakaslahti, has been conducting fieldwork for many years on the processes of psychological healing that occur at Bālājī. He agrees: “Here psychological distress is expressed and treated in terms of spirit affliction, culturally congenial to large segments of the Indian population.”54 However, Pakaslahti avoids the increasingly vague term “hysteria,” consistent with its banishment from the 1994 edition of the DSM, and sees the possession and exorcisms at Bālājī as effective family therapy, regardless of any claims to the facticity of possession.55 The reason for the effectiveness of the therapy, says Pakaslahti, is that at least one member of the family of the afflicted party accompanies him or her to the healing center, and, in the presence of the family, the healer is careful to expunge the afflicted person of guilt by convincingly shifting the blame for the individual’s dysfunctionality from the individual to the afflicting spirit. The anthropologist Michael Lambek, who has studied possession in Mayotte, an island in the Mozambique channel between Madagascar and Tanzania, puts it this way: “To argue that spirits are imagined is not to hypostatize them but to locate the work of imagination in its social context, in history.”56

Lambek states flatly, perhaps more decisively than Kakar or Pakaslahti would find comfortable: “Spirits are products of imagination, partial world constructions that are fictional but not simply fictitious.”57 In other words, whatever condition it may be, it is not possession, even if those experiencing it are not lying or misguided by their cultural preceptors.58 Among such conditions often associated with possession are “dissociation, fugue states, multiple personalities, fainting, functional epileptic seizures and other behavior of an apparently hysterical type,” writes Bourguignon.59 Many of these conditions have been favored diagnoses for possession, particularly dissociation, which falls within the general category of “double consciousness—in which two different human personalities apparently coexist in association with a single physical body.”60 From the point of view of the Western commonsense assumption of a unitary self lurking behind multiple personalities, double or multiple consciousness is an aberration. As Roland Littlewood suggests, however, distancing himself from Lambek’s psychoanalytic rationalism, “this might not be altogether legitimate.”61 Clifford Geertz provides a tidy summary of the Western conception of the person, a description that should be kept in mind throughout this study. This person is a “bounded, unique, more or less integrated motivational and cognitive universe, a dynamic center of awareness, emotion, judgment and action organized into a distinctive whole and set contrastively both against other such wholes and against a social and natural background.” It is no less important that Geertz notes, as an addendum to this definition, that this is “a rather peculiar idea within the context of the world’s cultures.”62

Littlewood, a practicing psychiatrist, suggests that this notion of a “single bounded and volitional self which shares a body which gives rise to it” hangs together as a result of the potential accessibility to awareness of various facets of the personality such as habits, abilities, memories, and idiosyncratic responses to stimuli. However, he adds, “this hanging together becomes unstuck in dreams, or in the usual process of forgetting and inattention, such that chunks of past experience cannot necessarily be recalled simultaneously.” These chunks, says Littlewood, citing Jung, are “split off ‘complexes’” or fragments (of which Tambiah speaks) that “might be so extensive as to actually constitute a parallel secondary self.”63 The concept of double consciousness, of dissociation, popular in the nineteenth century, fell out of favor for much of the twentieth century and has experienced a well-publicized revival since the 1980s under the designation Multiple Personality Disorder (MPD). Most recently, the latter has been rechristened Dissociative Identity Disorder.64 Furthermore, the DSM-IV has dropped the category of hysteria, which served as the bedrock of Freud’s view of possession, and suggested a new category for further research called “dissociative trance disorder.” Among the features of “dissociative trance disorder” are the following:

- A.possession trance, a single or episodic alteration in the state of consciousness characterized by the replacement of customary sense of personal identity by a new identity. This is attributed to the influence of a spirit, power, deity, or other person, as evidenced by one (or more) of the following:
  - (a)stereotyped and culturally determined behaviors or movements that are experienced as being controlled by the possessing agent
  - (b)full or partial amnesia of the event
- B.The trance or possession trance state is not accepted as a normal part of a collective cultural or religious practice.
- C.The trance or possession trance state causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
- D.The trance or possession trance state does not occur exclusively during the course of a Psychotic Disorder … or Dissociative Identity Disorder and is not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance or a general medical condition.65

It is important to understand that the DSM-IV is not suggesting that the etiology of such a state is in fact spirit possession, but that this is the symptomatology of a mental state associated with reported possession episodes.
Littlewood does not regard double or multiple consciousness as necessarily an aberration or in general as a kind of pathology. “Humans have the ability to dissociate their mental processes and do so the whole time—through changing moods, selective attention and putting unpleasant issues out of mind, through fantasy and dreaming—for the potential contents of our awareness are hardly accessible simultaneously.”66 Dissociation, he says, is:

the necessary flip side of consciousness: it allows detachment of awareness from the immediate passage of events, part of the evolutionary development of “self-consciousness” as an internal system of representation and self-monitoring where the individual’s awareness can then objectivize their own cognitions (“my senses deceive me,” “I was overcome by emotion”), allowing self-recognition, anticipation, introspection, creative imagination, recognition of another’s motivations and possible identification with them, disbelief, and acting: all requirements for our complex programmes of intersubjective action.67

Such dissociation, he says, can be engendered through hypnosis, sensory deprivation or overload, hyperventilation (or, I might add, other forms of regulated breathing), the ingestion of psychoactive substances, as well as through witchcraft or spirit possession. All of these conditions may influence the individual to bring about concentrated attention, meditative states, a shared sense of community, out-of-body experiences, and so on.68 The fact that beginning in the nineteenth century the Western psychiatric model established these phenomena as intrapersonal in origin rather than as deity or spirit intrusion may be little more than an artifact of a culturally weighted scientific paradigm. There is no reason why the “dissolution of everyday agency”69 and its temporary reassignment cannot occur through a comportment of causation and volition that is differently constituted from that presented by the intrapersonally defined Western psychiatric model. This is not to defend the “reality” of spirit possession, however, but to point out the limitations of the psychoanalytic model in providing a “final” assessment of possession. To state succinctly the distinction between paradigms, I offer the following formulation: Possession as an intrapersonal phenomenon requires (at least) two minds in one body, but as an interpersonal phenomenon requires two minds in one body and one mind in two bodies.70 An immediate objection to this formulation is that the possessor might be a disembodied spirit. However, as we discuss below (Chapter 8), the classical Indian doctrine of embodiment is multilayered and only with certain qualifications allows for true disembodiment.

Robert I. Levy et al. state: “Two conditions are necessary for full possession to flourish: people who are psychologically disposed to dissociation, and a cultural environment that makes conventional use of possession episodes.”71 Few would disagree with the latter, but some would view possession as integration rather than dissociation (leaving aside Littlewood, who would regard dissociation as an alternative mode of integration). In a relatively early article on possession in India, Stephen Fuchs comments on the barwa, male exorcists of central India, and distinguishes their dissociation from more pathological dissociation:

We might be tempted to diagnose the case of the barwa as that of a “dissociated personality.” Whenever he is “possessed,” the barwa assumes a different personality—that of his familiar, who speaks and acts through him with the authority and behavior of a superhuman force. In psychopathic cases, however, this change of personality takes place automatically and cannot be controlled by the individual patient; the barwa, on the other hand, is able deliberately to produce this psychic state.72

In an influential 1963 article, “Spirit Possession and Social Structure,” Edward B. Harper states that the spirit possession he observed among Havik brahman women of coastal Karnataka could be “labeled dissociation, characterized by compartmentalisation of the personality in which one aspect acts more or less independently of another.”73 This dissociation, Harper argues, is comparatively benign and functions as a stress reduction mechanism as well as an outlet for the expression of power by women disadvantaged by the incumbent social structure. As with Lambek, however, it is not spirit possession:

under certain prescribed conditions and in certain prescribed manners, it is relatively commonplace in most parts of the world for some individuals to identify themselves so completely with another as to believe they are the other, and to be considered neither mad nor impostors by their fellow citizens. The particular type of complete-identification role playing I am talking about involves temporarily taking the identity of—not another human being but—a personified supernatural being.74

What Lambek and Harper do is draw a fixed line between psychological disturbances as understood in the Cartesian Western sense, influenced, it appears, by the Protestant perspective outlined above and spiritual disturbances in the Mayotte or Indian sense. I am not arguing that Lambek and Harper are wrong or morally in error by denying or minimizing the emic viewpoint; nor am I attempting to argue that scholars who “admit” the possibility of possessing agents are right. Scholarship, notably in the social and philological sciences, must depart from emic discourses and follow, as their designations suggest, the positivist moorings of science, at least to the extent of searching for mechanisms for distant, difficult, or vague ideas, such as possession. Nevertheless, I contend that both etic and emic categories of interpretation are limited if they are not used to complement, or at least accompany, each other. A case in point is dissociation, a disputed concept that does not necessarily encompass the concept of possession.

The Finnish folklorist Lauri Honko, who has produced a major study of an oral epic named after its heroine, Siri, in the same area in which Harper worked, quizzed his informants on the relationship between domestic problems and possession in the performance of the epic. “Our psychologising questions concerning the identification of possession cult members with their mythical (epic) models began to irritate Gopala Naika [a possession priest, Honko’s principal informant], as they seemed to imply manipulation of the epic plot in relation to prevalent moods and problems in the audience.”75 In other words, Honko’s informants had no use for Westerners psychoanalyzing their possession rituals.76 There is little doubt that South Asians in possession would unanimously reject such psychoanalytic interpretations. This, however, is not to suggest that Honko’s questioning was wrongheaded and culturally insensitive. Indeed, Honko’s thorough work appears, to some extent at least, to bear out Harper’s observations. These observations, in turn, are useful in discussions of bhakti-induced āveśa.

As is so often the case in psychology, these and other psychoanalytical interpretations of possession originate with Sigmund Freud, the revived importance of Janet’s work on dissociation aside. In 1919, while attempting to understand the concept of the “uncanny” (Unheimlich), Freud cited F. W. Schelling (1775–1854), who stated that “‘Unheimlich’ is the name for everything that ought to have remained … secret and hidden but has come to light.”77 Based on this and other definitions, “Freud developed the idea that the uncanny arouses anxiety because the familiar and the unfamiliar appear in inextricable conjunction.”78 The bewilderment other people’s possession induced in Western fieldworkers has often reminded them of Freud’s Unheimlich and his association of it with repeated “doubling, dividing, and interchanging of the self” (Ich-Verdoppelung, Ich-Teilung, Ich-Vertauschung).79 Furthermore, many (if not most) ethnographers tacitly accept Freud’s distinction between the externalizing primitive and the internalizing civilized. Freud bases this distinction on his belief that the premodern subject labored under the delusion that external forces were responsible for neuroses that were, in fact, internally induced. This amounted to a declaration of the superiority of the uncanny by rationality. We revisit this possibility in later discussions of possession in Indian literature (see Chapters 8 and 12). He wrote to W. Fliess, “The medieval theory of possession, held by the ecclesiastical courts, was identical with our theory of a foreign body and a splitting of consciousness.”80 Possession, he concluded, was a mistaken diagnosis for hysteria.81 He was not, it seems, concerned with dissociation and did not address that problematic.

Although hysteria fell out of favor with the American Psychiatric Association, many researchers have chosen to retain and reinterpret it. Clarke Garrett, a historian who has worked on possession among the Shakers of North America, describes hysteria as a legitimate “act of communication, intended for an audience whose shared values and expectations enable it to interpret the behavior in culturally normative terms.”82 In this sense, it shares common ground with possession. Indeed, Garrett asserts, “spirit possession and hysteria become two names for the same thing—a kind of spectacular body language for expressing convictions or emotions too profound, too painful, or too dangerous to be expressed verbally.”83 In this interpretation, the possession is again reduced to an interpretation, rendering it a phenomenon induced solely by internal psychic processes. Thus it ends up asserting the same old truth claim of the psychoanalytic viewpoint and the falsehood of the subject’s assertion. Dissociation theory, however, allows the indigenous or emic voice a role in etic theorizing, as seen above in the construction of “dissociative trance disorder.” Littlewood’s consideration of possession as a nonpathological and even psychologically advantageous state of dissociation—whose causes are both variegated and little understood—not only is thus in keeping with recent advances in psychiatric taxonomy, but is a more prudent route to take in a study of a culture with a long, diverse, and abundant history of reported possession phenomena.

As should be clear by now, possession states, like other states of mind, are psychological states. Interpretations of these states, perhaps most of which are grounded in cultural and religious beliefs, assumptions, and practices, must consider the psychological content of these states within the framework of these cultural and religious contexts. If interpretations of phenomena that are regarded by the experiencer as religious, spiritual, or in some way extraordinary depend too strictly on psychoanalytic (or, for that matter, any other) models, which is to say at the expense of examining what people actually do, then these interpretations risk becoming overdetermined or, more simply, too normative for their own good as they slip into discontinuity with their subject matter. An example of this is Masson’s Freudian analysis of Indian asceticism, mentioned above, which poses many excellent questions but entirely neglects actual ascetic practice and, in the end, disintegrates into puerile oversimplification.84 This is one reason why I am attempting in the present study to temper my textual examination with a survey of the ethnography of possession. Fortunately, most recent studies are a good deal more culturally sensitive and accommodating than their predecessors and are considerably more advanced theoretically because of it.85

Perhaps the best-known studies of possession in South Asia that rely on psychoanalytic interpretative strategies are Stanley and Ruth Freed’s seminal 1964 study of possession in a North Indian village,86 Obeyesekere’s many studies of possession in Sri Lanka,87 and Jeffrey Kripal’s Kālī’s Child.88 I address only the latter because Castillo has effectively deconstructed the work of the Freeds and Obeyesekere, demonstrating that their psychoanalytic interpretations are based on assumptions of “unfulfilled oedipal desires” of those experiencing possession (cf. Tambiah above), assumptions for which, Castillo shows, there is not a shred of evidence.89

In his far-reaching examination of the life of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, the well-known nineteenth-century Bengali saint, Kripal intrepidly defends his use of psychoanalytic categories in analyzing Ramakrishna’s ecstatic experiences and possession states. In spite of occasional lapses into Freudian overspeculation, Kripal does not wander into the trap into which Masson precipitously plunged of abandoning his primary subject (in this case, Ramakrishna), entranced by Freud’s seductive gaze. Kripal’s often attractive and compelling work is well known for the wrong reason, namely, the criticism it (and he) has sustained at the hands of the Ramakrishna Mission and its allies, who believe that their patron saint has been desecrated by this Freudian upstart.90 Kripal eventually concludes that Ramakrishna’s ecstatic experiences, possession states, and homoerotic visions (to say nothing of his asceticism and misogyny) were to a considerable extent compensatory behavior for the early death of his father as well as for conflicted experiences of sexual seduction.91 Sarah Caldwell, however, presents more solid evidence that in India possession states may be linked to transvestism, sexual conflict, and sexual abuse.92 Among women, the experience of bādhā āveśam (demonic possession) resembles other varieties of dissociative trance that occur as a result of anxiety, depression, withdrawal, low self-esteem, victimization, hallucinations, hearing voices, and so on. These states, she suggests, following Castillo, are not due so much to sexual dysfunction as to sexual abuse at a young age.93 It has proved difficult to ferret out of the earlier Sanskrit literature evidence for such abuse and consequent possession.

At their worst, psychological interpretations of other people’s possession reduce it to sexual dysfunction, illness, or incoherence and erroneous perception arising from dissociation; at their best they consider the indigenous context and explore whether and to what extent that forces modification in their own theories.94 One sociologist who, like Kripal, worked in Bengal was Deborah Bhattacharyya (whose important study Kripal never cites, though it was published more than two decades earlier). She notes that, in Bengal, possession represents “a kind of pseudo-pāgalāmi [insanity], wherein the person only appears to be pāgala.”95 This is distinguished from insanity as a medically defined pathological condition, in Bengali called māthāragolamāla (the disease of head malfunctioning).96 Such recognition of indigenous categories is all too rarely found in psychoanalytic analyses of possession.97 Caldwell, working in Kerala, states: “As in other areas of India, mental imbalance is traditionally believed to be a sign of possession by an evil spirit, either male or female—but, significantly, not by Kāḷi or any other deva (divine being).”98 A psychiatrist in Kerala known to Caldwell pointed out to her that the symptoms of “hysteria and sexual dysfunction” among women were similar to the “feelings of inner heat, trembling, and rage that typify the inner experience of possession reported by actors”99 performing the possession dramas that Caldwell observed. Why this should be so is not clear. It is possible that possession, regardless of the locus of its expression, exhibits external manifestations of feelings of trembling, rage, and so on simply because these are culturally recognized symptoms of possession and because possession is a form of practiced behavior, as Rich Freeman and others point out. In fact, Freeman’s definition of possession is sensitive to this issue: “To be possessed means to perform the possession rituals correctly and manifest possession behaviors.”100 At any rate, a topic not sufficiently discussed by Obeyesekere and others is the relationship between possession drama and compensatory possession brought on by physical, sexual, or mental abuse.

Another advocate of psychoanalytic interpretations of possession is Charles Nuckolls. He supports psychoanalysis as an analytic construct to be used in conjunction with others, however. Notably, he considers the rationality—the inferences and decision-making processes—that contributes to the possession-mediumship that characterizes the ritual healing among the Jalaris of coastal Andhra Pradesh. He notes that despite the “abundance of literature on South Asian possession … answers to the question ‘How does it work?’ are limited, for the most part, to ‘psychological’ and ‘sociological’ perspectives that have been around for years.”101 Jalari possession falls within the realm of what Sax calls “oracular possession”: It is concerned largely with healing and other sorts of problem solving. In this way, it is rather unlike most possession that occurs in festivals or in Sanskrit literature, where oracular possession is unusual.102 In any event, studying possession-mediumship as an inferential process helps to contextualize and modify the usual psychocultural interpretations. Nuckolls recognizes that emotion and thought both contribute to decision-making, and he notes how this contributes to Jalari possession. He cites strong evidence that possession-mediumship among Jalari and non-Jalari informants arose as a resolution to generational crises: ambivalent mother-son relationships that led to the son’s “identification with the mother-goddess as a central aspect of the self” or, in the case of women, “transformation into possession-mediums as a process of recovering deceased sons to whom they felt ambivalently attached.”103 After he establishes the generational and gendered basis of Jalari possession, he then analyzes the ritualized possession process in terms of contextual linguistic strategies and decision-making processes. Thus Nuckolls’s approach represents an advance over the usual psychoanalytic theorizing. Nevertheless, because of the nature of the ancient and classical Indian material, the synthetic approaches of Nuckolls, Kripal, and Caldwell are of limited use to us here.104
