The definition of possession cited earlier by Boddy in her review article on the literature of possession has the advantage of both conceptual precision and elasticity. This definition bears repeating. Possession, Boddy says, is a broad term referring to an integration of spirit and matter, force, or power and corporeal reality, in a cosmos where the boundaries between an individual and her environment are acknowledged to be permeable, flexibly drawn, or at least negotiable.7

Erika Bourguignon notes a curious statistic: Out of 488 societies examined, 360 of them (74 percent) showed evidence of possession belief and 251 (52 percent) evinced possession trance.8 She defines possession accordingly. After stating that possession “is an idea, a concept, a belief which serves to interpret behavior,” she says:

We shall state that a belief in possession exists, when the people in question hold that a given person is changed in some way through the presence in or on him of a spirit entity or power, other than his own personality, soul, self, or the like. We shall say that possession trance exists in a given society when we find that there is such a belief in possession and that it is used to account for alterations or discontinuity in consciousness, awareness, personality, or other aspects of psychological functioning.9

In addition, we may cite Rex L. Jones, who studied spirit possession in Nepal:

Spirit possession can be defined as an altered state of consciousness on the part of an individual as a result of what is perceived or believed to be the incorporation of an alien form with vital and spiritual attributes, e.g. the spirit of a superhuman form such as a witch, sorcerer, god, goddess, or other religious divinity.10

Carl Becker provides broad leeway in defining possession as:

the phenomenon in which persons suddenly and inexplicably lose their normal set of memories, mental dispositions and skills, and exhibit entirely new and different sets of memories, dispositions, and skills.11

By simply defining possession as a type of behavior, he avoids (perhaps too cautiously) the knotty problem of an individual being taken over by another (presumably discarnate) being or conscious entity. This broad definition should become useful in dealing with the broad category of possession in South Asia. Bearing in mind that these definitions are offered by anthropologists rather than classicists or historians of religion and that they have different emphases—possession as an integrated but fluid psychophysiological state, as an interpretative idea, and as an altered state of consciousness induced by an external agent—they are good starting points.12

Historically, the study of possession has been a Eurocentric concern, mostly by white men studying an experience of mostly nonwhite men and women. Certain fallacies incumbent in this enterprise in early studies of possession, which are apparent to the turn-of-the-millennium eye (but which continue to the present in many cases), were summarized by W. G. Jilek in 1971 in his analysis of the “sick medicine-man” thesis. The fallacies of this thesis, which can be applied to the “possession thesis,” are that the very notion of the “sick medicine-man” is:

(1) Eurocentric, insofar as it tries to explain descriptive data collected in non-Western cultures by Western scientific theories, ignoring the non-Western folk systems of explanation and overlooking Western folk systems analogous to shamanic institutions; (2) Positivistic insofar as it considers behaviour which does not fit into the framework of logico-experimental explanatory theories … as departure from rational norms due to “ignorance and error,” under which is subsumed the “poor reality testing” of psychopathology.13

Although the early British ethnographers who mapped out the “cultures, artifacts, and peoples” of the British Raj were unabashedly Eurocentric and positivistic, these tendencies have been in decline with recent methodological advances in anthropological research. An increasing number of anthropological studies of possession, for example, those by Peter Claus, Edith Turner, Smriti Srinivas, and Daniel Halperin, all discussed below, question the anthropologist’s presumed superior understanding of possession—superior, that is, to the understanding of the people under study.14 A substantial number of anthropologists and folklorists, such as Humphrey and Laidlaw, Claus, Erndl, Caldwell, and Sax, understand the issues at stake here and address them cogently; and, among them, Claus directly addresses the central problematic.

Echoing a theme I note often in this study, Claus contends that the results of anthropological studies of possession have been guided by preselected models, which in most cases means that the method determines the madness at the expense of fair and adequate representation of the cultural context. Although very different from the early British ethnographies, the methodological assumptions and approaches are now much more varied and abstract. An example, discussed more fully below, of the overdetermined nature of many modern studies is revealed in Richard Castillo’s indictment of Gananath Obeyesekere and others whom Castillo believes forced their evidence to fit their theories. In the case of Obeyesekere in particular, Castillo tries to show that his assertion of repressed oedipal desire as the primary causal factor in possession is completely mistaken—that Obeyesekere’s data cannot possibly support this claim. Claus’s point bears on the problematic of the one-way discourse of many studies such as Obeyesekere’s (which, nonetheless, may still be valuable and illuminating). He states, “I doubt that any serious anthropological study gives credence to the native claim that they are possessed by spirits, although we do sometimes acknowledge that we can proceed with the study ‘as if there were spirits.’”15 Fortunately, this attitude of grudging acknowledgment is an increasing trend, which opens the discussion considerably and allows for more nuanced interpretations. Halperin states, along the same lines:

While externally formulated, or “etic,” approaches normally consider possession from the perspective of the human individual or society, the practitioner’s own worldview is nearly always an actively spirit-centered one. Ritualists typically perceive the essence of possession rites not as entering a trance but as being entered by spirit(s), by a force clearly outside themselves.16

As shown below, many recent studies are not exclusively concerned with constructing their own theories of possession or justifying fully formed theories that they have adopted, but also consider the implications of the emic viewpoint for the people under study. This is not to criticize any particular theories or the enterprise of theorizing, but to say that theorizing can be much more fruitful when granting those under study the facticity of their viewpoints.

Studies of possession commonly (and correctly) ask one or more of three questions: What is possession? How does it work? What does it mean? In spite of several cogent definitions, such as those noted above, there is little agreement on what possession actually is. How it works is also not well understood or generally agreed upon. The greatest disagreement, however, is over the last question, which most researchers, curiously, feel qualified to address even as they readily acknowledge ignorance in relation to the first two questions. This is reminiscent of physics, in which the existence and role of black holes can be postulated and surmised, yet “from within which,” declares the science writer Timothy Ferris, “one may rest assured, no reporter will ever file dispatches.”17

Since the earliest serious field studies of possession about a century ago, a considerable amount of work on the subject has been carried out, most of which views possession as “a symbolic expression of other experiences.”18 This characteristic of anthropological interpretations strives to unearth psychological, medical, or social causes of possession. This investigative tendency, Elizabeth Schoembucher maintains, is due to the Western social scientists’ insistence on rationality and “search for a deeper meaning.”19 This has resulted in a series of different interpretations, in which the fact that possession is seen as an ecstatic religious experience by the people themselves is intellectually indefensible, an academic inheritance from the Protestant-dominated cultures of anthropology and the study of religion, which subtly yet pervasively establish hierarchies subordinating sorcery, witchcraft, and “natural” religion to higher “revealed religion.”20 This disregard for indigenous voices and interpretations is noted by Humphrey and Laidlaw, who, not surprisingly, reject the interpretive strategies of most of their contemporaries. They contend that most ethnographers read ritual, a category in which possession most often falls, as “an escape for the ethnographer from the bewildering and dispiriting prospect of thinking about multifarious individuals.”21 One of the features of the present study, I hope, is to permit the texts, our current voices under examination, to speak for themselves, to admit at least some of their own light by allowing their own interpretations to arise more or less unhindered, given the limitations I fully recognize in the oft-stated caveat that every act of reading or translating is an act of interpretation. Another objective is to avoid reifying or “orientalizing” possession—a possibility against which Arjun Appadurai warns in no uncertain terms when he speaks of “the unruly body of the colonial subject (fasting, feasting, hook swinging, abluting, burning, and bleeding)” as a creation of the “exoticizing gaze” of orientalism.22

Possession has usually been examined from the perspective of one of five interpretative frameworks: (1) as demonic, opposed to God and good; (2) as a medically defined psychological state; (3) as a psychological condition engineered for the purpose of gaining social or even political control; (4) as an aspect of shamanism; and (5) as an existential reality. I deal with each of these in turn.
