  <meta property="og:description" content="This is borne out in a study of the bibliographies in an issue of Puruṣārtha devoted to possession; cf. Assayag and Tarabout 1999. The issue contains thirteen articles (excluding the prologue and epilogue), of which five are on Kerala, two each on Himachal Pradesh and Karnataka (one of these on Tulunad), and one each on Rajasthan, Tamilnadu, Nepal, and Kashmir. The brief article on Kashmir is by André Padoux and is the only one in the collection devoted to possession in the premodern period (cf. Chapter 10). These are based on either synonyms or homonyms; see Vogel 1979. Good examples are Sanskrit dictionaries. For example, Monier-Williams’s English-Sanskrit Dictionary (1851) is of no value because it simply has an English word followed by a large number of Sanskrit words, with no effort to contextualize any of them. By contrast, his Sanskrit-English Dictionary (1899) is much better in that he often (but, by no means, always) cites texts from which he draws a word’s meanings. Better still is the seven-volume Sanskrit-Wörterbuch by Böhtlingk and Roth (1855–75). Best is the Deccan College dictionary (Ghatage et al. 1976–), which, after more than half a century of work, including more than three decades of publishing (as of this writing twenty-six fascicles have been published), is about a third of the way through the first letter of the alphabet. Although the completion schedule has become something of a long-running joke, few scholars doubt the validity of the project or, for the most part, its results. Similarly, the Critical Pali Dictionary (Trenckner et al. 1948–90) begun in the nineteenth century is nowhere near completion. Most dictionaries of regional languages are utterly nonhistorical. To be generous, however, historically sensitive lexicography is definitely on the increase. See, for example, Tulpule and Feldhaus 1999, for Marathi, which tries to recognize chronological changes in meaning. Sontheimer 1989b:142ff. Erndl 1996:178. Cf. Korom 1992:275ff. Caturvedi and Tiwari 1975; cf. bhūtabādhā. Erndl 1996:178; also Erndl 1993:108. Wadley writes that khelnā “identifies an active and extreme possession which is manifested by the physical activity of the possessed; khelnā is also used to indicate goddess possession in Karimpur” (1976:237n6). Shukla 1980:167. Gold 1988:38. Pfleiderer and Lutze 1979:111. Freed and Freed 1993:17. Glucklich 1997:49. Many of these are found in rural areas, including Bālājī. This contravenes Dumont and Pocock (1959:56–57), who estimated that healers, as distinguished from oracles, are found only in urban settings in India. See Chapter 12 and F. Smith 2004 for notes on the spirit healing center at Chottanikkara in Kerala. The healing centers at Muslim dargāhs (such as at Badayun, in U.P., south of Bareilfy) and other Sufi-oriented Muslim healing places (such as Matka Pir in Delhi) have clientele that are at least half Hindu. Dwyer’s ethnographic work (1998, 1999, 2003) was primarily on possession and healing in the main temple of Bālājī, while Pakaslahti has been documenting the work of a healer (bhagat) who conducts his sessions at one of the shrines near the temple. Bālājī has experienced exponential growth in the past twenty-five years, since Kakar was there. Pakaslahti estimates that the better known of the many healers there have hundreds of patients, who are often treated simultaneously. Most of these healers come to Bālājī for regular brief visits from other cities in north India (personal communication); also see Pakaslahti 2005. Much of the following description is based on my own observations at the shrine that Pakaslahti has studied, augmented by Pakaslahti’s explanations; cf. Pakaslahti 1998:146ff. The tactics of exorcism at Bālājī vary so greatly that it is certain that some of what I observed does not occur at all of its exorcism and healing clinics. Conversely, some of the tactics employed at these other centers are not employed in the adālat that I observed. For a vivid depiction of one healing, see a video for which Pakaslahti was the primary research and scientific advisor: Kusum, by Jouko Aaltonen (Illume Co., 69 minutes; Helsinki, 2000). Dwyer 1998:7. The emerging work of Bellamy (2004) at Husain Tekri shows that this image has a broad and varied distribution in northern and western India. This is a common genre of popular music in contemporary India. A Sikh family was also present when I was there and responded similarly. Dwyer 1999:113. Cf. Obeyesekere 1981; Hiltebeitel 1988, 1991. Dwyer notes: “I was told that the possessed frequently experience a choking sensation (galā bhar ānā), a contraction of the muscles in the throat, and/or a sense of being bound up (bandha); and informants commented that these are the reasons why tight-fitting garments are loosened before, and sometimes during, the ritual, and why a woman’s hair must be untied” (1999:113). See Davis 2001:99ff., and the discussion in Chapter 11, for surrogate possession in eighth- to twelfth-century China. Davis’s important study seeks to free possession (pingfu [to lean on and adhere to]) from its “shamanic substrate” and bring it to the center of Chinese religious practice, as the present effort aims to do for India. Davis, to the detriment of his otherwise tight and groundbreaking study, rarely refers to anthropological theory or other situated studies, at least in English. For example, his acceptance of Rouget’s definition of possession as merely “a trance of identification” (ibid.:1, 84) is often inadequate, even for his material. Nevertheless, he does refer to many studies in French and Japanese, lest anyone assume (as Janice Boddy has, apparently) that English is the sole authoritative language for the study of possession. Also important for Chinese religion is Teiser 1988. He makes a case for placing spirit possession within the “shamanic substrate” (to which Davis reacts). He writes that “the shaman is one who has special mastery over shen—spirits from afar, his own spirit, and spirituality in general. The shaman’s special access to shen, then, implies that his mediumship works both ways: he can be possessed by spirits, and he is an adept at soul journeys” (p. 145). In fact, Chinese elites—Buddhist, Confucian, and Daoist—placed these wu (shamanic practitioners) in a substrate. But these are disputes that I am hardly qualified to enter. For a somewhat similar situation, see Werbner and Basu 1998:15, where a dargāh is thought of as a Mughal court presided over by a dead saint, potent with charisma, but whose primary minister is a sajjāda. Again, here we have examples of a debate between healer and jinn, where the person’s body is the battleground between the sajjāda and the client. One of the Sanskrit manuscripts on possession on which I base my discussion in Chapter 11 below employs the compound kapisainyaprakāra, indicating that one is invoking not only Hanumān but also the army of monkeys (kapisainya) that assisted him in his invasion of Laṇkā. The phauj here is thus evocative not only of the Rāmāyaṇa but of other possession complexes in India. For another example of this, in what must be regarded as an extended South Asian religious complex, see Bertrand 2004 on the conversion of “errant” Khmer spirits in Cambodia known as brāy to Buddhist pāramī, spirits who exhibit the Buddhist perfections (Skt. paramā). See also Vogt 1999, discussed below. “She” because the assistant in this “clinic” was a sensitive woman named Meena who was herself a former patient who came to this work after a series of traumatic events befell her life leading to a nearly total psychological collapse. See also Trawick 1992:153, for a roughly similar instance, a woman who had experienced possession of Māriamman when she was young who then became a spirit healer only after a near fatal bout of tuberculosis. Pakaslahti 1998:143. Parry states that in Varanasi, at least, a healer and assistant who work together are recognized by certain specific terms: “The ojhā lures and entraps the ghosts, while the sokhā supervises his efforts and is the real expert in identification” (p. 236, diacritics added). The situation was not quite the same at Bālājī. For a similar process of questioning the spirit in more Islamic-centered possession, see Nasir 1987:165f. For a Buddhist context, see Vogt’s findings in Sri Lanka (below). I am here reminded of a description of an exorcism found in Philostratus’s life of Apollonius of Tyana (Philostratus 1970). Philostratus probably finished writing this text in 220 C.E., while Apollonius, one of the earliest travelers from Greece to India, probably lived in the mid- to late first century C.E. There is no possibility of linking through any recoverable tradition the practice that Apollonius describes with practices in contemporary India. Nevertheless, the passage is of such interest that it is worth quoting in full: In the middle of this conversation, the Wise Men were interrupted by the messenger bringing some Indians who needed cures. For instance, he brought forward a woman praying to them on her son’s behalf. He was sixteen years old, she said, but had been possessed for two years by a spirit with a shy, deceitful character. One of the wise men asked what her evidence was, and she said, “This boy of mine is rather handsome in appearance, and the spirit is in love with him. He will not allow him to be rational, or go to school or to archery-training, or to stay at home either, but carries him off to deserted places. My boy no longer has his natural voice but speaks in deep, ringing tones like a man; his eyes, too, are someone else’s than his own. All this makes me weep and tear my hair, and I scold my son as you would expect, but he does not recognize me. But when I decided on this journey, which I did a year ago, the spirit confessed who he was, using my son as a medium. He said he was the ghost of a man who formerly died in war, still very much in love with his wife; but the woman broke their marriage bond three days after his death by marrying another man, and from that time, he said, he had loathed the love of women and had transferred his affection to my son. And he promised that if I did not accuse him before you he would give many wonderful presents to the boy; and this rather made me change my mind. But he has been keeping me waiting for a long time now, acting as sole master of my house, with his wicked, deceitful ways.” The Wise Man then asked her if the boy was with her, but she said, “No: I did everything to make him come, but that spirit threatened me with mention of ‘cliffs’ and ‘abysses,’ saying he would kill my son if I accused him here.” “Don’t worry,” said the Wise Man; “he will not kill him when he has read this,” and he brought a letter out of his pocket and gave it to the woman; it was addressed to the spirit, and contained threats and warnings. (pp. 83–84) This story has many of the elements of what may be found today, including a setting of family therapy, decided dysfunctionality and marked changes in behavior by the individual possessed, identification of the offending spirit, and threats and warnings by the exorcist. Cf. Hiltebeitel 1989a and Mayer’s study of the phenomenon in the Nyingmapa sect of Tibetan Buddhism (1996:109–132). In the latter case, Śiva as Bhairava and Rudra/Maheśvara is tamed and converted to Buddhism. For more on the cuṛail, see Chapter 12. Pakaslahti, personal communication October 2001. See Pakaslahti 1998:139. Dwyer (1998:11ff.) statistically analyzed the results of interviews with 734 patients or their caregivers. He discovered that 35 percent of women and 26 percent of men believed their afflictions were caused by bhūt-prets and that half of both female and male respondents believed that they were harmed by occult practitioners. The biggest differential was between married and single persons: “68 per cent of married persons as opposed to 28 per cent of single persons, in fact, accused their enemies of directly harming them by means of sorcery” (p. 12). Dwyer has much to say about this. Information from Pakaslahti, confirmed by my own observations. I am indebted to him for taking me to Bālājī in April 2001. Casual visitors to Bālājī may examine the immediate surroundings of the main temple, including the pitṛsthān behind it. On a wide dirt track immediately behind the temple, the visitor may see on any day a fairly large number of people with large heavy stones either balanced on their heads or placed on several parts of their supine bodies. These are meant to press on the bhūt-prets in order to help expel them from the victims’ bodies. These stones are clearly much heavier than an ordinary person could bear. The victims might remain motionless in those positions for a few minutes or a few hours before family members struggle to remove the stones. The pitṛsthān rises on a hill behind the temple and resembles a graveyard of stone tumuli. These are, in fact, commemorative stones to deceased ancestors whose possessed and exorcised descendants have placed them there. This is also a site for ordeals. The “clinics” (a very inadequate word) such as I describe here are quite small, consisting of a room or two in houses outside the main temple. Seidel 1987:228. The bureaucratization of celestial regions and netherworlds in China has long been a source of discussion; see Nickerson 1996. Davis 2001:61. Ibid.:95. Davis comments (101ff.) on the striking similarity of exorcism rituals with Song dynasty criminal proceedings. Ibid.:2001:106, also 46. The notion of an army of spirits is not unique to India and China. In Uganda this notion has been elevated to real armies, battles for national political control, and mass murder; see Behrend 1999. Davis 2001:45ff. for accounts of the exorcistic services of fashi, a somewhat amorphous class of ritual specialists who could be Daoist priests, laymen, or spirit-mediums. See also Schipper 1993:49ff. on the category of “barefoot master.” The fashi is the lowest-ranking priest in the Daoist hierarchy. He commands spirit militias filled with petty demons, hungry ghosts, and wandering spirits, and his troops “save the people, fight evil, and heal the sick” (ibid.:50). Davis 2001:106. Cf. Shulman 1994:7f Davis 2001:109. Seidel 1987:229. See also Eder 1973:194ff., passim, on the division of the Chinese universe into yin (darkness) and yang (light): “A shen, a good spirit or god, comes from the beneficent half of the universe; a kuei, a demon or spectre from the opposite half. Every good in the world comes from a shen, every evil is inflicted by a kueï” (p. 195). Furthermore, “[a]fter death the soul is helplessly exposed to hordes of spirits” (p. 194). Only through the grace of bodhisattvas can these beings be saved. Note the vague resonance of this with the rationale behind the increasingly popular mass exorcisms of the living in contemporary American Christianity documented by Cuneo 2001. For complex demonologies in the Hindukush, with Indic, Chinese, and Central Asian influence, see Jettmar 1975:219ff. Pakaslahti 1998:132. Goudriaan 1977:145; this is in a collection of Balinese hymns written in very corrupt Sanskrit. Cf. Īśānaśivagurudevapaddhati 43.68. For more on Khaḍgarāvaṇa, see Chapters 10 and 12. Cf. Sen 1971:701–702. Sen gives the etymological meanings of bhar(a) as “weight, load, cargo; full” and of bhara as “to fill up, to thrust in.” These meanings are a short step to possession. Nevertheless, I am unable to find uses of the Sanskrit √bhṛ in the sense of possession; usually it has little meaning beyond the literal “excess, bearing; burden, weight, mass, bulk, fullness.” Hints, such as ṚV 1.60.5, vājaṃbhara, hardly serve as evidence. Östör 1980 notes the Bengali ānanda korā (to make joy), a joy that serves as the “the basis of devotion to and possession by Bhairab, Śiva’s deputy in the gājan” (p. 138). Their merrymaking, their ānanda, is a result of consumption of large quantities of country wine. See also Bellamy’s observation noted in Chapter 2, n. 196. Sen 1971:701. Bhattacharyya 1986:172. Ibid.:59–75, 180–181. Alternative terms for māthār golmāl are māthā-khārāp (bad-head), māthā-garam (hot-head), and the Sanskrit borrowing unmāda (insanity) (p. 65). Maloney (1976:132) adds the Bengali mukh-lāge (evil face). See also Gonda 1969 for a detailed study of early Indian (and Indo-Iranian) notions of the nature and consequences of eye contact. On the evil eye, ághoracakṣuḥ (Ṛgveda 10.85.44), átjfhoreṇa cákṣusā (Atharvaveda 14.2.12), etc., see pp. 33ff. E.g., Netratantra 19.2. As we see in Chapter 12, the curse of the evil eye is quite predominant in this text of the end of the first millennium C.E. I am grateful to Amitava Bhattacharji for this information. On the manifestations of naẓar and its relationship to desire and caste, see Pocock 1992. See also Kapadia 2000:182, for remarks on the evil eye (tirusti &lt; Skt. dṛṣṭi) in Tamil. Without citing sources, Maloney gives two additional Sanskrit words: kudṛṣṭi (weak sight, evil or sinister eye, heterodox opinion or doctrine) and pāpadṛṣṭi (sin-sight). These are, however, common enough in Sanskrit. Cf. Maloney 1976:128. Bhattacharyya 1986:181. Note Bhattacharya’s alternation between the non-retroflex and retroflex “l.” McDaniel 1990:21 and passim; see also McDaniel 1988:87–99. McDaniel 1988; idem 1990:91; also Caldwell 1996:207. I have corrected the transliteration and diacritics of both Bhattacharyya and McDaniel. McDaniel 1988:87, 96. Ibid.:87. Ibid. Molesworth 1857:76. Molesworth states in his introduction that his sources consisted of paṇḍits in the Konkan area of coastal Maharashtra. Karpūramañjarī, 37–38, 243. Tulpule and Feldhaus 1999:72. Cf. Stanley 1988:40ff.; also Sontheimer 1989b:78. Compare this with bhūt bādhā (harmful possession by a ghost); Stanley 1988:26ff. Sontheimer notes that one who is possessed by any of these the gods Birobā, Mhaskobā, and Khaṇḍobā is called devācī jhāḍ (god’s tree) (p. 193). Wadley 1976:238. Wagle records bhūte āṅgī vāḍhu lāglī (became possessed by bhūts), āṅgāt vāḍhlā (possessed), and bhutācā asvār āṇūn (the bhūt was induced to possess) in court documents dated 1812 (1995:197, 211). Stanley 1988:27. Ibid.:57. Ibid.:48. The district gazetteers published throughout India beginning in the 1870s and revised periodically for at least a century are also useful sources for possession. In spite of the normatively brahmanical presentation of religion in some of the volumes (e.g., the Satara District gazetteer), others try to present a more balanced view. For example, the Poona District gazetteer discusses the demigod Vetāḷa, the local demonology, and the ubiquity of belief in spirits and possession in Maharashtra; cf. Gazetteer of Bombay State: Poona District (1954:126–128). Feldhaus 1995:48, cf. also pp. 11–13; and 126ff. for ethnographies. Ibid.:134. Berti 1999:61–97. Berglie 1976:86. Berglie worked with Tibetan refugee communities in Nepal and India in the early 1970s. He does not state that spirit-mediumship among the Tibetan refugees in Nepal is constituted differently from that in Tibet. It is unlikely to have accumulated significant influences from the indigenous Nepali population by that date. Another study of possession and spirit belief among Hindus, Muslims, and Buddhist tribals in central Nepal is by Gaborieau (1975a), who has recorded statements allegedly uttered by members of a class of spirits of the dead, those who suffered accidental death, called bāyu. See also the excellent studies by Crook (1997, 1998) on oracular possession among Ladakhi Buddhists, as well as the shamanic narratives and Buddhist metanarratives that guide the process. Srinivas 1998:134. In western Nepal, Gaborieau (1975b: 158ff) has noted that the word avatār is normally employed for the possession of a deity by a medium. This possession is instigated by a tantric master who calls the deities into the body of the medium. Clearly, there is a greater infusion of Indo-Aryan (IA) terminology in Nepali (an IA language) than there is in Ladakhi. Srinivas 1998:132. See Nagano 2000:587f., for distinctions made between kinds of possessed festival mediums among the Tibetans of northern Tibet and southern Qinghai province, China: “Tibetan people generally judge the greatness of a lha pa on the basis of whether or not he can verbalize the gods’ words. In addition to that, they distinguish a lha pa from a lha pa tshab on the basis of whether he has actually been possessed. They also distinguish between lha (rang) ’bab rgyab ‘the deity itself descends from heavens’ and lha phab/’bebs ‘to make a deity descend.’” See Paper 1995:54ff., 115, for a description of four shamanic specialists in ancient China. It is possible that there is a common ancestry for these groups. Srinivas 1998:126. See Mumford, who renders mi-kha as “envious talk” (1989:140). Considerable information on possession in Nepal is in Hitchcock and Jones 1976; also Samuel 1993:194–196. Höfer 1994. This exemplary work is first and foremost a linguistic study, though this inevitably leads to a “thick description” of Tamang shamanic ritual. The book also includes glossaries of Tamang, Tibetan, and Nepali words. Admirably, Höfer devotes considerable space to explaining his terms. Ibid.:20. See also Gutschow 2004 for this and related shamans and oracles in Ladakh. Ibid.:26–27, 72–74. Bakhtin 1981; cf. Mumford 1989:13ff. Mumford makes extensive use of Bakhtin’s observations (1968, 1984) on Rabelais and Dostoevsky. Spirits are often said to be fond of milk; see the translations of the āyurvedic texts in Chapter 12. Note also in the same chapter the discussion of the Malayalam word kaiviṣa, a kind of poisoning in which spirit possession is involved. Mumford 1989:196ff. Ibid.:144. See also the discussion of the Madanamahārṇava in Chapter 12. Ibid.:148. Mumford adds, “The shaman regards his own exorcisms as more effective for that reason, justifying his own violent rites as the only effective way to expel demons from the community.” Berglie 1982a, also see Berglie 1976, 2000. For more on the dpa’-bo, see p. 304f. For a wealth of material on shamanic healing and possession in northern Tibet, much of which is clearly imprinted on Nepali Buddhist shamanic possession, see Bellezza 2005. Unfortunately, this volume came to me too late to make full use of it. She was a ḍākinī and one of the main consorts of Padmasambhava. It is not without interest that the dpa’-bo call the mirror gling (“world”); cf. Berglie 1976:94. This appears to be consistent with the tenor of Buddhist philosophy. See my extended discussion of this in Chapter 11. See Bellezza 2005:23–28 for an interesting description of a number of Tibetan words for this magical mirror. Berglie 1982b:164. Berglie 2000:30. See also Pettigrew and Tamu (1994), who briefly describe possession among the Gurang of central Nepal. The term for possession in that dialect of Nepali is khhelye khhaba (god has caught, captured, covered) (p. 421n4). Dietrich 1998, esp. pp. 39ff. for demonologies, pp. 160ff. for healing practices. Regrettably, the book does not include an index. An important study of psychiatric treatment from the textual point of view, with a few ethnographic examples, is Clifford 1984. This is discussed extensively in Chapter 12. See also Merz 1996, which describes the goddess Hāratī in the Kathmandu Valley, whose cult has arisen since the mid-twentieth century. Hāratī confers on her devotees oracular possession as well as disease, but also heals. This is consistent with evidence found elsewhere for other deities. See also Diemberger 2005 on various terms for oracles and oracular possession in southern and central Tibet. Cf. Hiltebeitel 1988, 1991, passim, esp. note 1988:275. Cf. R. L. Turner 1969:65, #1437, also #1446, āvēsika. See also Obeyesekere 1970:98 and Hiltebeitel 1988:275. Although Simhala is an Indo-Aryan language, āvesa in Sri Lanka shares semantic features with its counterpart in Tamil. Obeyesekere 1981:34, passim. Ibid.:24, 84, 100f., passim. Fabricius 1897 [1972]:61–62. Cf. Carman and Narayanan 1989:168. I thank Vasudha Narayanan for the Tamil text. Handelman and Shulman 2004: 40; see also Shulman 2002:134. On the Sanskrit anugratha, see Chapter 12. Hiltebeitel 1991:344. Ibid.:343f; see also Reiniche 1979. Hancock 1995:89n19. This observation requires further corroboration. That I have not seen this distinction elsewhere raises the question of whether Hancock’s informant was sharing no more than her personal syntactic sensibility. Meyer 1986. Cf. Ramaswamy 1997. Meyer 1986:110n2. Ibid.:110. Ibid.:258ff. More important is Klimkeit 1976. Klimkeit’s use of term teufelstänz is thus not an accurate translation, but reflects the usage of previous scholarship extending back to the early eighteenth century and Ziegenbalg. Clearly “devil’s dance” is pejorative and must be understood in the context of Protestant missionary activity on the Malabar coast; e.g., Burnell 1894, 1896. See also Brückner 1987 and, much more extensively, 1995. Nabokov 2000:120. Foulston 2002:140ff. Cf. Diehl 1956:177; also Biardeau 1989b:149f., 153f.

Ibid.:101. Ibid.: 115. Hiltebeitel shows the same resolution of āvēsam in the Draupadī cult in northern Tamilnadu. It is relevant here to cite Bertrand’s 2004 study of spirit possession and Buddhism in Cambodia, because what he finds resembles in part the situation in Sri Lanka. In one important way, however, it is dissimilar. In Cambodia many monks, in addition to laity, undergo possession in which they attempt to convert wayward spirits to Buddhism. This, observes Bertrand, “is a complete infraction of the Vinaya, the code of conduct that regulates the life of monks.… Trance is unacceptable for a monk, as it is proof of the absence of serenity and a lack of behavioural control” (p. 163). Thus many of these monks “chose to [temporarily] defrock rather than break the monastic rules” (ibid.). The situation in Cambodia is unique, however. The large number of new mediums there, both lay and monastic, is often interpreted “as the wish of the Buddha to aid mankind and also to pacify and educate all the souls of the dead killed under Pol Pot” (p. 166). The proximity of Buddhist monks to deity or spirit possession is discussed elsewhere as well; cf. DeCaroli 2004:25ff., 128ff. Yocum 1982:189. It is also important to see the evidence from various first-millennium Tamil sources gathered by Hardy (1983:136–138, passim). Yocum 1982:188ff. Anyone who has read this far would profit by referring to Yocum’s section on possession (pp. 187–194). On the matter of dating, see Tieken’s revisionist view attributing the Caṇkam poetry to the second half of the first millennium C.E. (2001) and Hart’s strong criticism of this view (2004). Both authors argue their cases well. I am not qualified to say which of the two is right. However, I must offer two observations: (1) the consensus remains that the Caṇkam poetry is of the first half of the first millennium C.E. (2) This is important because it is assumed that much of Indian devotional possession deriving from Sanskrit traditions and sources (e.g., from the traditions based on the Bhāgavata Parāṇa) ultimately derives from Tamil texts and religiosity. Tieken proposes to reverse this. If this were true (and I do not see a definitive solution), then the history of devotional, oracular possession would have to be revised, placing the time of its popularization a half a millennium later and its locus more squarely in Sanskritic rather than Tamil religiosity. Hardy comments on the female presence in Tamil possession and ecstatic dancing: “Therefore it may not be accidental that in later bhakti religion, where these forms of worship appear again, the psychology of religious awareness is ‘female’” (1983:140). The south Indian origin of what he rather flatly calls “emotional bhakti” is one of the main themes of Hardy’s Viraha-Bhakti. Vogt 1999:xi. Wirz 1954:14ff.; also Scott 1994:16, passim. Scott 1994:279. Wirz 1954:14ff. Vogt 1999:13. Ibid.:11, table 2. Ibid.:109ff. Ibid.:xi. Exceptions to this perhaps harsh assertion may nevertheless be cited, e.g., Hiltebeitel, Sax, Korom, and certainly others. Vogt’s psychological interpretations (ibid.:74ff.) are indebted to the work of J. L. Moreno, the founder of “sociometry” and “psychodrama.” Her interpretations are intriguing and often convincing. However, she does not support her otherwise good arguments for application of Moreno’s ideas with reasons why Moreno’s psychodrama is more compelling than Freudian or other allied psychoanalytic theories. Moreno, for better or worse, stands beyond the pale of Freudian and other more medicalized systems that dominate psychological perspectives of scholars in the humanities and that have, partly for this reason, achieved greater subtlety and nuancing than Moreno’s views. Ibid.:130. Ibid.:48, yakunte dharmayan ana-kirima (Simhala); see also pp. 84–100. See Walters 2000 for a powerful critique of the uses and misuses of the Pāli vaṃsas by the authors themselves, nationalist Sri Lankans of the nineteenth and twentieth century, and European scholars of the same period. Despite many valuable insights, Walters is much too (fashionably) zealous in stigmatizing the textualists upon whom his own work depends. Scott’s postcolonial positionings are much more sophisticated than Vogt’s. The latter was clearly unfamiliar with Scott’s work. My comments above on the freedom of continental European scholarship to work outside the present trends of post-colonialism, etc., should be tempered by such admissions. Vogt 1999:131. Scott 1994:228. In spite of this, it must be noted, Scott appears to be unaware of what these virtuous commands actually are. Although he adds that aṇaguna “conveys in fact the very force of the Buddha’s moral authority” (p. 25), he appears not to have studied the Buddhism that he admits rests at the basis of this healing process.

A “world peace sacrifice to the goddess” (viśva-śānti-devī-yajña) was performed at that time. All quotations are from pp. 11–15 of the book. I am grateful to Loriliai Biernacki for lending this to me. The Web site www.hindubooks.org/temples/assam/kamakhya/page23.htm states cogently that the festival is “so called because of the tremendous sound produced by the instruments such as drum, dhole, etc.” This argues for a more shamanistic identity of debaddhani. The chapbook says nine are possessed, but Loriliai Biernacki reports that, according to her informants, the number is not fixed, and as many as fifteen have been possessed in previous years. Cf. the descriptions of possession found in the principal āyurvedic texts; see Chapter 12. Wadley 1976:235. Her main sources for these words are Berreman 1963 and Planalp 1956. I am in no position to comment authoritatively on the distribution of these words. Henry 1981:303; Lambert 1988:356. Fuchs 1964. McClintock 1990:37, 47. See the Gujarat State Gazetteers: Broach District 1961: 121, 124; also p. 124 for a vivid description of the rite of exorcism. Wagle 1995:194, 198. McClintock 1986:42–47. Bhattacharyya’s discussion is recommended for its linguistic sensitivity. On Vodoun possession by loa, the local spirits, see Hurston 1938: “The person mounted does nothing of his own accord. He is the horse of the loa until the spirit departs. Under the whip and guidance of the spirit-rider, the ‘horse’ does and says many things he or she would never have uttered un-ridden” (p. 221). phaḍ ity anena mantreṇa tatrāśvārohaṇa viśet | Āgamarahasyam 3899ab, 2:330. Macdonald 1975:327n5, for regional variants of this word. Dietrich 1998:259 and passim, records the word dhami as a rural variant. Viswa Shanti Devi Yajña Committee (2004):15. Cf. Mumford 1989:148n12; also Aziz 1978:52ff. Mumford labels sngags pas as “magicians” who practice “violent” means of exorcism. In this sense, he may be misrepresenting the teachings and practices of sngags pas themselves, but correctly representing the views of local Tibetan villagers in remote parts of Nepal who, over centuries of direct contact and folklore, have come to see them as such. See, for example, the Sanskrit manuscripts on possession discussed in Chapter 11. Although this is correct in its Sanskritic reference, Gellner notes that in Newari the word vaidya refers to “any type of healer who is not directly possessed” (2001:97). See Carstairs and Kapur 1976. Brückner 1995:89ff.; Honko 1998:341. Claus is more specific, stating that this is used for a spirit medium (1979:29). Macdonald 1975:118. Höfer 1994:18. Macdonald’s designation is also too restrictive for Gellner, who, like Höfer, regards a jhṃkri as a shaman in a more general sense; cf. Gellner 1994:31. Ibid.; also Merz 1996:347. Hāratī, the “goddess who steals,” is a Hindu-Buddhist crossover deity. She is worshipped by both Hindus and Buddhists, her temple ritual is performed by Newar Buddhist Vajrācāryas, and she is related to other deities of possession, including her husband Unmatta (“Drunken”) Bhairava and several of their children. Cf. Gellner 1988. Gellner 1994:31 (= 2001:202). Gellner 1994:32 (2001:203). Gellner 1992:326ff. Höfer 1994:17–19. Gaborieau 1975a:73, 76ff. Berglie 1976. Dietrich 1998:119–159. Karim 1988:277–309. The kabirāj is also discussed by Risley 1891:362–366. Karim 1988:295. The word bhasan, writes Karim, “suggests one who is floated” (p. 307n15). Shukla 1980:167. Caldwell 1996:223n23. It is of little value to discuss words found in dictionaries without comment or contextualization. Thus it suffices to merely mention that the old standard English and Tamil Dictionary, by Winslow, Spaulding, and Pillai (1888 [1842]), lists the following: under “possession by an evil spirit”–tēvarālan, veṟiyāṭṭu, āvēsam (p. 1019); under “oracle”–āvēsakkāram, tēvarālan, paṭimatton. Freeman 2001:190. Inglis 1985:90–91; for a similar list see Diehl 1956:221ff. Inglis studied the similarities between possession dancers and the local manufacture of clay images, both serving as vessels for the divine. We have seen this image of the possessed as a vessel in Tibetan and in Tulu, via Sanskrit. Doubtless it occurs elsewhere in South Asia as well and is a common image elsewhere in the world. For example, Spanish attests vasos preferidos (chosen vessels) and cajitas (little boxes), for those who accept certain spirits for oracular and curative purposes; cf. Kay F. Turner 1992:126. Lawrence 2003. Maloney 1980:242. Ibid.:242ff.; for more on the evil eye in the Maldives, see pp. 258ff. This is not unlike a brujo in Mexico. On the evil eye in Sri Lanka, see Wirz 1954:178f. On Telugu, see Knipe 2001. He observes that the Telugu word for “possession speech” is vakku (cf. the observation by Lawrence in Sri Lanka) and that “possession ritualists who have one or more neighborhood goddesses ‘come to’ or ‘come on’ them, to employ common Telugu parlance for possession [is] an event also known substantively by the word pūnakam” (p. 344). In a more recent article (2004), Knipe states, importantly, that “Godavari Brahmans are reluctant to mention āveśa, samāveśa, or related experiences, whereas pūnakam, the moment when Ammavāru or a deceased person descends on the occupant of a gaddi [a ‘seat’ for a possession ritualist, shared with the goddess], is eagerly discussed by all ritualists who claim routine divine visitation, as well as by their clients and assembled audiences who share each detail with the village and town folk at large” (p. 440). See also Nuckolls (1991a), who mentions that in Telugu a person on or in whose body a deity comes is called bhaktudù (m) or bhakturàlu (f) (&lt; Skt. bhakta; a devotee). I suspect that these words have broader semantic fields. However, see the 1961 edition of the Broach (present-day Bharuch) district gazetteer (123ff.). Spirits are referred to as bhūts, as is the case all over northern India, the word for possession is vaḷgan. Spirits are divided into family or household spirits (bharṇābhūt) and outside spirits (baharṇābhūt). If a man remarries after the death of his first wife, it is believed that the spirit of the first wife might possess the second. However, if post-mortem rites are properly performed, the spirit will be pacified. An array of spirits and goddesses of lower-caste Hindus are believed to be responsible for the possession. More fieldwork must be done on possession in Gujarat to fill out this very thin picture. See, for example, Troisi 1976, which lists more than five hundred studies of this “tribe,” as it is still classified, of Bengal, Orissa, and Bihar, most of them in English, in many of which, doubtless, one can find references to spirit possession. Nevertheless, I am reminded by William Sax that though “everyone gets possessed, high caste and low, upper caste people tend to deny it of themselves [at least in Garhwal], and attribute it to the subalterns” (personal communication, November 1999). This he attributes to brahmanical image-conjuring rather than suppression, though he does see an effort of Hindu nationalists to suppress possession and other kinds of popular Hinduism. This prurience is little different from that of their detested Victorian predecessors. Pakaslahti has hard evidence to back up Sax’s observations: “Seeking help from Bālājī is not related to illiteracy, low caste status or rural domicile, as the majority of the clientele has average or better than average education, belong to the higher castes and are of urban domicile” (1998:164). Ramanujan 1986a:69. Knipe notes that vaidika brahmans in the community he has studied in coastal Andhra Pradesh do “not enter into a heightened state of consciousness after drinking soma.” Yet they are “well aware of the emotional rhetoric of transformation, most dramatically in the large-scale sharing of soma in a śrauta sacrifice such as the vājapeya, pauṇḍarīka, sarvatomukha or the currently rare agniṣṭoma for a newly initiated member of the soma society” (2004:438). For example, the presence in the Draupadī cult’s Mahābhārata of a Muslim devotee, Muttāl Rāvuttaṉ, who serves Draupadī by accepting blood sacrifices for her and receiving impure offerings, including gāñjā, opium, cigars, and arrack. At one temple, red and green chili peppers are offered to his dog. Cf. Hiltebeitel 1988:101–127. It is difficult to imagine a more non-brahmanical Mahābhārata. Cf. Prabhu 1977; Honko 1998:389–421; also Knipe 1989. It is important not to commit the error of assuming that because the vocabulary of possession in northern India is in a large number of instances derived from Sanskrit, while in southern India it is less the case, possession in the north is more inclusive of upper classes. North Indian languages are Indo-Aryan while south Indian languages are not, so the idiom of possession in the north would “naturally” be more Sanskritic. Similarly, the presence of a Dravidian vocabulary for possession in the south cannot be used as evidence that the possession is somehow non-brahmanical. Correlation of language with culture is an idea that is dying all too slowly; one would have thought that this would have ceased sixty-five years ago with the publication of Frans Boas’s Race, Language and Culture (1940). Note the superannuation of the term aṇaṅku in present-day Tamil (or Malayalam) by the concept (and term) śakti. Cf. Jones 1968. See now Davidson 2002 for a wealth of evidence that tribal practices influenced the development of Mahāyāna Buddhism in the first millennium C.E. Berglie 1996. This epic is still transmitted largely orally, through bards of virtually every stratum of Tibetan society. No standard edition of the text exists, nor is one likely to be produced anytime soon. Geoffrey Samuel has also done important work on the traditions and shamanic dimensions of the Gesar epic; see Samuel 1991, 1994, 2005. Ibid.:17. I agree with Gellner (2001), following Dumont and Pocock, that “it is probably better to talk only of Great Traditions, which certainly exist, and to contrast them with ‘popular religion.’ To call the latter a Little Tradition either appears to imply that it is organized in the same way as the Great Traditions (which it is not) or that it constitutes a pool of survivals of pre-Hindu or pre-textual practices (which is doubtful)” (p. 100). Here I equate “folk” with Gellner’s “popular religion.” Cf. Rigopoulos 1993:54n18. Rigopoulos reports that a devotee of Sai Baba, possessed by Khaṇḍobā, supplied information on Sai Baba’s personal history (47f., 53f.) (which, unfortunately, Rigopoulos accepts as pramāṇa). Sontheimer (1989a, 1989b, and elsewhere) also supports the folk vs. classical Hinduism dichotomy. But the dichotomy Sontheimer writes about is based only on recent historical and contemporary arrangements. Cf. Gellner 2001:203. For certain spiritual practices (upāsana) that involve possession of Hanumān, see Śrīmālī n.d. Gellner writes: “a Maharjan (Farmer) man from a village south of Lalitpur who appeared one day in Kwā Bāhāḥ (an important Buddhist sacred complex) and claimed to be possessed by Kwābāju, i.e. Śākyamuni Buddha, was met with polite but definite scepticism” (2001:211). For a description of a spirit medium who “dances” Śākyamuni Buddha in contemporary Singapore, see DeBernardi 1995:158. See Holt 2004a, 2004b for Viṣṇu possession in Sri Lanka; and Gellner 1988 [2001:102] on the possession of the king of Nepal: “He was considered to be like Vishnu and to be possessed by him in ritual contexts.” See also Dietrich 1998:236, for an account of a Nepali healer who claims possession by Brahmā, Viṣṇu, and Śiva, among others. Not only is the latter apparent from much of the evidence presented in this volume, but one of the primary areas of Indological study in the twentieth century was the determination of Aryan and non-Aryan in early Sanskrit literature. See, for example, Deshpande 1995. Cf. Hiltebeitel 1991. Erndl states: In reading about South Asia, one often gets the impression that possession, along with related ecstatic behavior, belongs to the “little tradition” and is thus largely confined to the lower castes and the poor and uneducated in rural areas. However, in my experience, the phenomenon of possession in the cult of Śerāṇvālī is widespread throughout the population. I have witnessed Goddess possession in both village and urban settings, among low and high castes (including Brahmins), the poor and the rich, the uneducated and the educated, Sikhs as well as Hindus. (1996:179) Bell argues that ritualization is not a “standardized process” of traditionalization, but that: [r]itual can be a strategic way to “traditionalize,” that is, to construct a type of tradition, but in so doing it can also challenge and renegotiate the very basis of tradition to the point of upending much of what has been seen as fixed previously or by other groups. Examples abound, ranging from the ascetic internalization of the Vedic sacrifice and the iconoclasm of early Ch’an Buddhism to the Reformation’s challenge to papal authority through a recreation of the free outpouring of the spirit to the early church. (1992:124) For an accessible general discussion of this, see Bryant 2001, ch. 5. As I write this in Iowa, I am surrounded by the states of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, Missouri, South Dakota and Nebraska, while the best-known place names in the region are those of the Mississippi River and the city of Chicago. All of these are Native American names, the total number of which by now surely exceeds the number of Native Americans in these areas who have any knowledge of their ancestral languages. Although an extreme example, it is nevertheless not wholly dissimilar to the results found elsewhere of linguistic and cultural contact. Mayaram 2000. See F. Smith 1987:59–63, 121–223. See Pollock 1990. Dirks 1992:231. Possession within epic or other narrativized ritual performance in south India yields rather similar results; cf. Hiltebeitel, Brückner, Biardeau, Caldwell, Freeman, and others. Zvelebil 1981:82. See also Stewart 1995:574ff. for a modern story of a faked devotional possession during the life of Haridāsa, a devotee of Śrī Caitanya in the early sixteenth century. Yocum 1982:144. There is earlier testimony for this in the Mahābhārata tale of Aśvatthāman, discussed in Chapter 6.">

  <meta itemprop="name" content="12 NOTES">
  <meta itemprop="description" content="This is borne out in a study of the bibliographies in an issue of Puruṣārtha devoted to possession; cf. Assayag and Tarabout 1999. The issue contains thirteen articles (excluding the prologue and epilogue), of which five are on Kerala, two each on Himachal Pradesh and Karnataka (one of these on Tulunad), and one each on Rajasthan, Tamilnadu, Nepal, and Kashmir. The brief article on Kashmir is by André Padoux and is the only one in the collection devoted to possession in the premodern period (cf. Chapter 10). These are based on either synonyms or homonyms; see Vogel 1979. Good examples are Sanskrit dictionaries. For example, Monier-Williams’s English-Sanskrit Dictionary (1851) is of no value because it simply has an English word followed by a large number of Sanskrit words, with no effort to contextualize any of them. By contrast, his Sanskrit-English Dictionary (1899) is much better in that he often (but, by no means, always) cites texts from which he draws a word’s meanings. Better still is the seven-volume Sanskrit-Wörterbuch by Böhtlingk and Roth (1855–75). Best is the Deccan College dictionary (Ghatage et al. 1976–), which, after more than half a century of work, including more than three decades of publishing (as of this writing twenty-six fascicles have been published), is about a third of the way through the first letter of the alphabet. Although the completion schedule has become something of a long-running joke, few scholars doubt the validity of the project or, for the most part, its results. Similarly, the Critical Pali Dictionary (Trenckner et al. 1948–90) begun in the nineteenth century is nowhere near completion. Most dictionaries of regional languages are utterly nonhistorical. To be generous, however, historically sensitive lexicography is definitely on the increase. See, for example, Tulpule and Feldhaus 1999, for Marathi, which tries to recognize chronological changes in meaning. Sontheimer 1989b:142ff. Erndl 1996:178. Cf. Korom 1992:275ff. Caturvedi and Tiwari 1975; cf. bhūtabādhā. Erndl 1996:178; also Erndl 1993:108. Wadley writes that khelnā “identifies an active and extreme possession which is manifested by the physical activity of the possessed; khelnā is also used to indicate goddess possession in Karimpur” (1976:237n6). Shukla 1980:167. Gold 1988:38. Pfleiderer and Lutze 1979:111. Freed and Freed 1993:17. Glucklich 1997:49. Many of these are found in rural areas, including Bālājī. This contravenes Dumont and Pocock (1959:56–57), who estimated that healers, as distinguished from oracles, are found only in urban settings in India. See Chapter 12 and F. Smith 2004 for notes on the spirit healing center at Chottanikkara in Kerala. The healing centers at Muslim dargāhs (such as at Badayun, in U.P., south of Bareilfy) and other Sufi-oriented Muslim healing places (such as Matka Pir in Delhi) have clientele that are at least half Hindu. Dwyer’s ethnographic work (1998, 1999, 2003) was primarily on possession and healing in the main temple of Bālājī, while Pakaslahti has been documenting the work of a healer (bhagat) who conducts his sessions at one of the shrines near the temple. Bālājī has experienced exponential growth in the past twenty-five years, since Kakar was there. Pakaslahti estimates that the better known of the many healers there have hundreds of patients, who are often treated simultaneously. Most of these healers come to Bālājī for regular brief visits from other cities in north India (personal communication); also see Pakaslahti 2005. Much of the following description is based on my own observations at the shrine that Pakaslahti has studied, augmented by Pakaslahti’s explanations; cf. Pakaslahti 1998:146ff. The tactics of exorcism at Bālājī vary so greatly that it is certain that some of what I observed does not occur at all of its exorcism and healing clinics. Conversely, some of the tactics employed at these other centers are not employed in the adālat that I observed. For a vivid depiction of one healing, see a video for which Pakaslahti was the primary research and scientific advisor: Kusum, by Jouko Aaltonen (Illume Co., 69 minutes; Helsinki, 2000). Dwyer 1998:7. The emerging work of Bellamy (2004) at Husain Tekri shows that this image has a broad and varied distribution in northern and western India. This is a common genre of popular music in contemporary India. A Sikh family was also present when I was there and responded similarly. Dwyer 1999:113. Cf. Obeyesekere 1981; Hiltebeitel 1988, 1991. Dwyer notes: “I was told that the possessed frequently experience a choking sensation (galā bhar ānā), a contraction of the muscles in the throat, and/or a sense of being bound up (bandha); and informants commented that these are the reasons why tight-fitting garments are loosened before, and sometimes during, the ritual, and why a woman’s hair must be untied” (1999:113). See Davis 2001:99ff., and the discussion in Chapter 11, for surrogate possession in eighth- to twelfth-century China. Davis’s important study seeks to free possession (pingfu [to lean on and adhere to]) from its “shamanic substrate” and bring it to the center of Chinese religious practice, as the present effort aims to do for India. Davis, to the detriment of his otherwise tight and groundbreaking study, rarely refers to anthropological theory or other situated studies, at least in English. For example, his acceptance of Rouget’s definition of possession as merely “a trance of identification” (ibid.:1, 84) is often inadequate, even for his material. Nevertheless, he does refer to many studies in French and Japanese, lest anyone assume (as Janice Boddy has, apparently) that English is the sole authoritative language for the study of possession. Also important for Chinese religion is Teiser 1988. He makes a case for placing spirit possession within the “shamanic substrate” (to which Davis reacts). He writes that “the shaman is one who has special mastery over shen—spirits from afar, his own spirit, and spirituality in general. The shaman’s special access to shen, then, implies that his mediumship works both ways: he can be possessed by spirits, and he is an adept at soul journeys” (p. 145). In fact, Chinese elites—Buddhist, Confucian, and Daoist—placed these wu (shamanic practitioners) in a substrate. But these are disputes that I am hardly qualified to enter. For a somewhat similar situation, see Werbner and Basu 1998:15, where a dargāh is thought of as a Mughal court presided over by a dead saint, potent with charisma, but whose primary minister is a sajjāda. Again, here we have examples of a debate between healer and jinn, where the person’s body is the battleground between the sajjāda and the client. One of the Sanskrit manuscripts on possession on which I base my discussion in Chapter 11 below employs the compound kapisainyaprakāra, indicating that one is invoking not only Hanumān but also the army of monkeys (kapisainya) that assisted him in his invasion of Laṇkā. The phauj here is thus evocative not only of the Rāmāyaṇa but of other possession complexes in India. For another example of this, in what must be regarded as an extended South Asian religious complex, see Bertrand 2004 on the conversion of “errant” Khmer spirits in Cambodia known as brāy to Buddhist pāramī, spirits who exhibit the Buddhist perfections (Skt. paramā). See also Vogt 1999, discussed below. “She” because the assistant in this “clinic” was a sensitive woman named Meena who was herself a former patient who came to this work after a series of traumatic events befell her life leading to a nearly total psychological collapse. See also Trawick 1992:153, for a roughly similar instance, a woman who had experienced possession of Māriamman when she was young who then became a spirit healer only after a near fatal bout of tuberculosis. Pakaslahti 1998:143. Parry states that in Varanasi, at least, a healer and assistant who work together are recognized by certain specific terms: “The ojhā lures and entraps the ghosts, while the sokhā supervises his efforts and is the real expert in identification” (p. 236, diacritics added). The situation was not quite the same at Bālājī. For a similar process of questioning the spirit in more Islamic-centered possession, see Nasir 1987:165f. For a Buddhist context, see Vogt’s findings in Sri Lanka (below). I am here reminded of a description of an exorcism found in Philostratus’s life of Apollonius of Tyana (Philostratus 1970). Philostratus probably finished writing this text in 220 C.E., while Apollonius, one of the earliest travelers from Greece to India, probably lived in the mid- to late first century C.E. There is no possibility of linking through any recoverable tradition the practice that Apollonius describes with practices in contemporary India. Nevertheless, the passage is of such interest that it is worth quoting in full: In the middle of this conversation, the Wise Men were interrupted by the messenger bringing some Indians who needed cures. For instance, he brought forward a woman praying to them on her son’s behalf. He was sixteen years old, she said, but had been possessed for two years by a spirit with a shy, deceitful character. One of the wise men asked what her evidence was, and she said, “This boy of mine is rather handsome in appearance, and the spirit is in love with him. He will not allow him to be rational, or go to school or to archery-training, or to stay at home either, but carries him off to deserted places. My boy no longer has his natural voice but speaks in deep, ringing tones like a man; his eyes, too, are someone else’s than his own. All this makes me weep and tear my hair, and I scold my son as you would expect, but he does not recognize me. But when I decided on this journey, which I did a year ago, the spirit confessed who he was, using my son as a medium. He said he was the ghost of a man who formerly died in war, still very much in love with his wife; but the woman broke their marriage bond three days after his death by marrying another man, and from that time, he said, he had loathed the love of women and had transferred his affection to my son. And he promised that if I did not accuse him before you he would give many wonderful presents to the boy; and this rather made me change my mind. But he has been keeping me waiting for a long time now, acting as sole master of my house, with his wicked, deceitful ways.” The Wise Man then asked her if the boy was with her, but she said, “No: I did everything to make him come, but that spirit threatened me with mention of ‘cliffs’ and ‘abysses,’ saying he would kill my son if I accused him here.” “Don’t worry,” said the Wise Man; “he will not kill him when he has read this,” and he brought a letter out of his pocket and gave it to the woman; it was addressed to the spirit, and contained threats and warnings. (pp. 83–84) This story has many of the elements of what may be found today, including a setting of family therapy, decided dysfunctionality and marked changes in behavior by the individual possessed, identification of the offending spirit, and threats and warnings by the exorcist. Cf. Hiltebeitel 1989a and Mayer’s study of the phenomenon in the Nyingmapa sect of Tibetan Buddhism (1996:109–132). In the latter case, Śiva as Bhairava and Rudra/Maheśvara is tamed and converted to Buddhism. For more on the cuṛail, see Chapter 12. Pakaslahti, personal communication October 2001. See Pakaslahti 1998:139. Dwyer (1998:11ff.) statistically analyzed the results of interviews with 734 patients or their caregivers. He discovered that 35 percent of women and 26 percent of men believed their afflictions were caused by bhūt-prets and that half of both female and male respondents believed that they were harmed by occult practitioners. The biggest differential was between married and single persons: “68 per cent of married persons as opposed to 28 per cent of single persons, in fact, accused their enemies of directly harming them by means of sorcery” (p. 12). Dwyer has much to say about this. Information from Pakaslahti, confirmed by my own observations. I am indebted to him for taking me to Bālājī in April 2001. Casual visitors to Bālājī may examine the immediate surroundings of the main temple, including the pitṛsthān behind it. On a wide dirt track immediately behind the temple, the visitor may see on any day a fairly large number of people with large heavy stones either balanced on their heads or placed on several parts of their supine bodies. These are meant to press on the bhūt-prets in order to help expel them from the victims’ bodies. These stones are clearly much heavier than an ordinary person could bear. The victims might remain motionless in those positions for a few minutes or a few hours before family members struggle to remove the stones. The pitṛsthān rises on a hill behind the temple and resembles a graveyard of stone tumuli. These are, in fact, commemorative stones to deceased ancestors whose possessed and exorcised descendants have placed them there. This is also a site for ordeals. The “clinics” (a very inadequate word) such as I describe here are quite small, consisting of a room or two in houses outside the main temple. Seidel 1987:228. The bureaucratization of celestial regions and netherworlds in China has long been a source of discussion; see Nickerson 1996. Davis 2001:61. Ibid.:95. Davis comments (101ff.) on the striking similarity of exorcism rituals with Song dynasty criminal proceedings. Ibid.:2001:106, also 46. The notion of an army of spirits is not unique to India and China. In Uganda this notion has been elevated to real armies, battles for national political control, and mass murder; see Behrend 1999. Davis 2001:45ff. for accounts of the exorcistic services of fashi, a somewhat amorphous class of ritual specialists who could be Daoist priests, laymen, or spirit-mediums. See also Schipper 1993:49ff. on the category of “barefoot master.” The fashi is the lowest-ranking priest in the Daoist hierarchy. He commands spirit militias filled with petty demons, hungry ghosts, and wandering spirits, and his troops “save the people, fight evil, and heal the sick” (ibid.:50). Davis 2001:106. Cf. Shulman 1994:7f Davis 2001:109. Seidel 1987:229. See also Eder 1973:194ff., passim, on the division of the Chinese universe into yin (darkness) and yang (light): “A shen, a good spirit or god, comes from the beneficent half of the universe; a kuei, a demon or spectre from the opposite half. Every good in the world comes from a shen, every evil is inflicted by a kueï” (p. 195). Furthermore, “[a]fter death the soul is helplessly exposed to hordes of spirits” (p. 194). Only through the grace of bodhisattvas can these beings be saved. Note the vague resonance of this with the rationale behind the increasingly popular mass exorcisms of the living in contemporary American Christianity documented by Cuneo 2001. For complex demonologies in the Hindukush, with Indic, Chinese, and Central Asian influence, see Jettmar 1975:219ff. Pakaslahti 1998:132. Goudriaan 1977:145; this is in a collection of Balinese hymns written in very corrupt Sanskrit. Cf. Īśānaśivagurudevapaddhati 43.68. For more on Khaḍgarāvaṇa, see Chapters 10 and 12. Cf. Sen 1971:701–702. Sen gives the etymological meanings of bhar(a) as “weight, load, cargo; full” and of bhara as “to fill up, to thrust in.” These meanings are a short step to possession. Nevertheless, I am unable to find uses of the Sanskrit √bhṛ in the sense of possession; usually it has little meaning beyond the literal “excess, bearing; burden, weight, mass, bulk, fullness.” Hints, such as ṚV 1.60.5, vājaṃbhara, hardly serve as evidence. Östör 1980 notes the Bengali ānanda korā (to make joy), a joy that serves as the “the basis of devotion to and possession by Bhairab, Śiva’s deputy in the gājan” (p. 138). Their merrymaking, their ānanda, is a result of consumption of large quantities of country wine. See also Bellamy’s observation noted in Chapter 2, n. 196. Sen 1971:701. Bhattacharyya 1986:172. Ibid.:59–75, 180–181. Alternative terms for māthār golmāl are māthā-khārāp (bad-head), māthā-garam (hot-head), and the Sanskrit borrowing unmāda (insanity) (p. 65). Maloney (1976:132) adds the Bengali mukh-lāge (evil face). See also Gonda 1969 for a detailed study of early Indian (and Indo-Iranian) notions of the nature and consequences of eye contact. On the evil eye, ághoracakṣuḥ (Ṛgveda 10.85.44), átjfhoreṇa cákṣusā (Atharvaveda 14.2.12), etc., see pp. 33ff. E.g., Netratantra 19.2. As we see in Chapter 12, the curse of the evil eye is quite predominant in this text of the end of the first millennium C.E. I am grateful to Amitava Bhattacharji for this information. On the manifestations of naẓar and its relationship to desire and caste, see Pocock 1992. See also Kapadia 2000:182, for remarks on the evil eye (tirusti &lt; Skt. dṛṣṭi) in Tamil. Without citing sources, Maloney gives two additional Sanskrit words: kudṛṣṭi (weak sight, evil or sinister eye, heterodox opinion or doctrine) and pāpadṛṣṭi (sin-sight). These are, however, common enough in Sanskrit. Cf. Maloney 1976:128. Bhattacharyya 1986:181. Note Bhattacharya’s alternation between the non-retroflex and retroflex “l.” McDaniel 1990:21 and passim; see also McDaniel 1988:87–99. McDaniel 1988; idem 1990:91; also Caldwell 1996:207.

Stanley 1988:40ff.; also Sontheimer 1989b:78. Compare this with bhūt bādhā (harmful possession by a ghost); Stanley 1988:26ff. Sontheimer notes that one who is possessed by any of these the gods Birobā, Mhaskobā, and Khaṇḍobā is called devācī jhāḍ (god’s tree) (p. 193). Wadley 1976:238. Wagle records bhūte āṅgī vāḍhu lāglī (became possessed by bhūts), āṅgāt vāḍhlā (possessed), and bhutācā asvār āṇūn (the bhūt was induced to possess) in court documents dated 1812 (1995:197, 211). Stanley 1988:27. Ibid.:57. Ibid.:48. The district gazetteers published throughout India beginning in the 1870s and revised periodically for at least a century are also useful sources for possession. In spite of the normatively brahmanical presentation of religion in some of the volumes (e.g., the Satara District gazetteer), others try to present a more balanced view. For example, the Poona District gazetteer discusses the demigod Vetāḷa, the local demonology, and the ubiquity of belief in spirits and possession in Maharashtra; cf. Gazetteer of Bombay State: Poona District (1954:126–128). Feldhaus 1995:48, cf. also pp. 11–13; and 126ff. for ethnographies. Ibid.:134. Berti 1999:61–97. Berglie 1976:86. Berglie worked with Tibetan refugee communities in Nepal and India in the early 1970s. He does not state that spirit-mediumship among the Tibetan refugees in Nepal is constituted differently from that in Tibet. It is unlikely to have accumulated significant influences from the indigenous Nepali population by that date. Another study of possession and spirit belief among Hindus, Muslims, and Buddhist tribals in central Nepal is by Gaborieau (1975a), who has recorded statements allegedly uttered by members of a class of spirits of the dead, those who suffered accidental death, called bāyu. See also the excellent studies by Crook (1997, 1998) on oracular possession among Ladakhi Buddhists, as well as the shamanic narratives and Buddhist metanarratives that guide the process. Srinivas 1998:134. In western Nepal, Gaborieau (1975b: 158ff) has noted that the word avatār is normally employed for the possession of a deity by a medium. This possession is instigated by a tantric master who calls the deities into the body of the medium. Clearly, there is a greater infusion of Indo-Aryan (IA) terminology in Nepali (an IA language) than there is in Ladakhi. Srinivas 1998:132. See Nagano 2000:587f., for distinctions made between kinds of possessed festival mediums among the Tibetans of northern Tibet and southern Qinghai province, China: “Tibetan people generally judge the greatness of a lha pa on the basis of whether or not he can verbalize the gods’ words. In addition to that, they distinguish a lha pa from a lha pa tshab on the basis of whether he has actually been possessed. They also distinguish between lha (rang) ’bab rgyab ‘the deity itself descends from heavens’ and lha phab/’bebs ‘to make a deity descend.’” See Paper 1995:54ff., 115, for a description of four shamanic specialists in ancient China. It is possible that there is a common ancestry for these groups. Srinivas 1998:126. See Mumford, who renders mi-kha as “envious talk” (1989:140). Considerable information on possession in Nepal is in Hitchcock and Jones 1976; also Samuel 1993:194–196. Höfer 1994. This exemplary work is first and foremost a linguistic study, though this inevitably leads to a “thick description” of Tamang shamanic ritual. The book also includes glossaries of Tamang, Tibetan, and Nepali words. Admirably, Höfer devotes considerable space to explaining his terms. Ibid.:20. See also Gutschow 2004 for this and related shamans and oracles in Ladakh. Ibid.:26–27, 72–74. Bakhtin 1981; cf. Mumford 1989:13ff. Mumford makes extensive use of Bakhtin’s observations (1968, 1984) on Rabelais and Dostoevsky. Spirits are often said to be fond of milk; see the translations of the āyurvedic texts in Chapter 12. Note also in the same chapter the discussion of the Malayalam word kaiviṣa, a kind of poisoning in which spirit possession is involved. Mumford 1989:196ff. Ibid.:144. See also the discussion of the Madanamahārṇava in Chapter 12. Ibid.:148. Mumford adds, “The shaman regards his own exorcisms as more effective for that reason, justifying his own violent rites as the only effective way to expel demons from the community.” Berglie 1982a, also see Berglie 1976, 2000. For more on the dpa’-bo, see p. 304f. For a wealth of material on shamanic healing and possession in northern Tibet, much of which is clearly imprinted on Nepali Buddhist shamanic possession, see Bellezza 2005. Unfortunately, this volume came to me too late to make full use of it. She was a ḍākinī and one of the main consorts of Padmasambhava. It is not without interest that the dpa’-bo call the mirror gling (“world”); cf. Berglie 1976:94. This appears to be consistent with the tenor of Buddhist philosophy. See my extended discussion of this in Chapter 11. See Bellezza 2005:23–28 for an interesting description of a number of Tibetan words for this magical mirror. Berglie 1982b:164. Berglie 2000:30. See also Pettigrew and Tamu (1994), who briefly describe possession among the Gurang of central Nepal. The term for possession in that dialect of Nepali is khhelye khhaba (god has caught, captured, covered) (p. 421n4). Dietrich 1998, esp. pp. 39ff. for demonologies, pp. 160ff. for healing practices. Regrettably, the book does not include an index. An important study of psychiatric treatment from the textual point of view, with a few ethnographic examples, is Clifford 1984. This is discussed extensively in Chapter 12. See also Merz 1996, which describes the goddess Hāratī in the Kathmandu Valley, whose cult has arisen since the mid-twentieth century. Hāratī confers on her devotees oracular possession as well as disease, but also heals. This is consistent with evidence found elsewhere for other deities. See also Diemberger 2005 on various terms for oracles and oracular possession in southern and central Tibet. Cf. Hiltebeitel 1988, 1991, passim, esp. note 1988:275. Cf. R. L.

Meyer 1986:110n2. Ibid.:110. Ibid.:258ff. More important is Klimkeit 1976. Klimkeit’s use of term teufelstänz is thus not an accurate translation, but reflects the usage of previous scholarship extending back to the early eighteenth century and Ziegenbalg. Clearly “devil’s dance” is pejorative and must be understood in the context of Protestant missionary activity on the Malabar coast; e.g., Burnell 1894, 1896.

Ibid.:101. Ibid.: 115. Hiltebeitel shows the same resolution of āvēsam in the Draupadī cult in northern Tamilnadu. It is relevant here to cite Bertrand’s 2004 study of spirit possession and Buddhism in Cambodia, because what he finds resembles in part the situation in Sri Lanka. In one important way, however, it is dissimilar. In Cambodia many monks, in addition to laity, undergo possession in which they attempt to convert wayward spirits to Buddhism. This, observes Bertrand, “is a complete infraction of the Vinaya, the code of conduct that regulates the life of monks.… Trance is unacceptable for a monk, as it is proof of the absence of serenity and a lack of behavioural control” (p. 163). Thus many of these monks “chose to [temporarily] defrock rather than break the monastic rules” (ibid.). The situation in Cambodia is unique, however. The large number of new mediums there, both lay and monastic, is often interpreted “as the wish of the Buddha to aid mankind and also to pacify and educate all the souls of the dead killed under Pol Pot” (p. 166). The proximity of Buddhist monks to deity or spirit possession is discussed elsewhere as well; cf. DeCaroli 2004:25ff., 128ff. Yocum 1982:189. It is also important to see the evidence from various first-millennium Tamil sources gathered by Hardy (1983:136–138, passim). Yocum 1982:188ff. Anyone who has read this far would profit by referring to Yocum’s section on possession (pp. 187–194). On the matter of dating, see Tieken’s revisionist view attributing the Caṇkam poetry to the second half of the first millennium C.E. (2001) and Hart’s strong criticism of this view (2004). Both authors argue their cases well. I am not qualified to say which of the two is right. However, I must offer two observations: (1) the consensus remains that the Caṇkam poetry is of the first half of the first millennium C.E. (2) This is important because it is assumed that much of Indian devotional possession deriving from Sanskrit traditions and sources (e.g., from the traditions based on the Bhāgavata Parāṇa) ultimately derives from Tamil texts and religiosity. Tieken proposes to reverse this. If this were true (and I do not see a definitive solution), then the history of devotional, oracular possession would have to be revised, placing the time of its popularization a half a millennium later and its locus more squarely in Sanskritic rather than Tamil religiosity. Hardy comments on the female presence in Tamil possession and ecstatic dancing: “Therefore it may not be accidental that in later bhakti religion, where these forms of worship appear again, the psychology of religious awareness is ‘female’” (1983:140). The south Indian origin of what he rather flatly calls “emotional bhakti” is one of the main themes of Hardy’s Viraha-Bhakti. Vogt 1999:xi. Wirz 1954:14ff.; also Scott 1994:16, passim. Scott 1994:279. Wirz 1954:14ff. Vogt 1999:13. Ibid.:11, table 2. Ibid.:109ff. Ibid.:xi. Exceptions to this perhaps harsh assertion may nevertheless be cited, e.g., Hiltebeitel, Sax, Korom, and certainly others. Vogt’s psychological interpretations (ibid.:74ff.) are indebted to the work of J. L. Moreno, the founder of “sociometry” and “psychodrama.” Her interpretations are intriguing and often convincing. However, she does not support her otherwise good arguments for application of Moreno’s ideas with reasons why Moreno’s psychodrama is more compelling than Freudian or other allied psychoanalytic theories. Moreno, for better or worse, stands beyond the pale of Freudian and other more medicalized systems that dominate psychological perspectives of scholars in the humanities and that have, partly for this reason, achieved greater subtlety and nuancing than Moreno’s views. Ibid.:130. Ibid.:48, yakunte dharmayan ana-kirima (Simhala); see also pp. 84–100. See Walters 2000 for a powerful critique of the uses and misuses of the Pāli vaṃsas by the authors themselves, nationalist Sri Lankans of the nineteenth and twentieth century, and European scholars of the same period. Despite many valuable insights, Walters is much too (fashionably) zealous in stigmatizing the textualists upon whom his own work depends. Scott’s postcolonial positionings are much more sophisticated than Vogt’s. The latter was clearly unfamiliar with Scott’s work. My comments above on the freedom of continental European scholarship to work outside the present trends of post-colonialism, etc., should be tempered by such admissions. Vogt 1999:131. Scott 1994:228. In spite of this, it must be noted, Scott appears to be unaware of what these virtuous commands actually are. Although he adds that aṇaguna “conveys in fact the very force of the Buddha’s moral authority” (p. 25), he appears not to have studied the Buddhism that he admits rests at the basis of this healing process.

A “world peace sacrifice to the goddess” (viśva-śānti-devī-yajña) was performed at that time. All quotations are from pp. 11–15 of the book. I am grateful to Loriliai Biernacki for lending this to me. The Web site www.hindubooks.org/temples/assam/kamakhya/page23.htm states cogently that the festival is “so called because of the tremendous sound produced by the instruments such as drum, dhole, etc.” This argues for a more shamanistic identity of debaddhani. The chapbook says nine are possessed, but Loriliai Biernacki reports that, according to her informants, the number is not fixed, and as many as fifteen have been possessed in previous years. Cf. the descriptions of possession found in the principal āyurvedic texts; see Chapter 12. Wadley 1976:235. Her main sources for these words are Berreman 1963 and Planalp 1956.

Bhattacharyya’s discussion is recommended for its linguistic sensitivity. On Vodoun possession by loa, the local spirits, see Hurston 1938: “The person mounted does nothing of his own accord. He is the horse of the loa until the spirit departs. Under the whip and guidance of the spirit-rider, the ‘horse’ does and says many things he or she would never have uttered un-ridden” (p. 221). phaḍ ity anena mantreṇa tatrāśvārohaṇa viśet | Āgamarahasyam 3899ab, 2:330. Macdonald 1975:327n5, for regional variants of this word. Dietrich 1998:259 and passim, records the word dhami as a rural variant. Viswa Shanti Devi Yajña Committee (2004):15. Cf. Mumford 1989:148n12; also Aziz 1978:52ff. Mumford labels sngags pas as “magicians” who practice “violent” means of exorcism. In this sense, he may be misrepresenting the teachings and practices of sngags pas themselves, but correctly representing the views of local Tibetan villagers in remote parts of Nepal who, over centuries of direct contact and folklore, have come to see them as such. See, for example, the Sanskrit manuscripts on possession discussed in Chapter 11. Although this is correct in its Sanskritic reference, Gellner notes that in Newari the word vaidya refers to “any type of healer who is not directly possessed” (2001:97). See Carstairs and Kapur 1976. Brückner 1995:89ff.; Honko 1998:341. Claus is more specific, stating that this is used for a spirit medium (1979:29). Macdonald 1975:118. Höfer 1994:18. Macdonald’s designation is also too restrictive for Gellner, who, like Höfer, regards a jhṃkri as a shaman in a more general sense; cf. Gellner 1994:31. Ibid.; also Merz 1996:347. Hāratī, the “goddess who steals,” is a Hindu-Buddhist crossover deity. She is worshipped by both Hindus and Buddhists, her temple ritual is performed by Newar Buddhist Vajrācāryas, and she is related to other deities of possession, including her husband Unmatta (“Drunken”) Bhairava and several of their children.

The kabirāj is also discussed by Risley 1891:362–366. Karim 1988:295. The word bhasan, writes Karim, “suggests one who is floated” (p. 307n15). Shukla 1980:167. Caldwell 1996:223n23. It is of little value to discuss words found in dictionaries without comment or contextualization. Thus it suffices to merely mention that the old standard English and Tamil Dictionary, by Winslow, Spaulding, and Pillai (1888 [1842]), lists the following: under “possession by an evil spirit”–tēvarālan, veṟiyāṭṭu, āvēsam (p. 1019); under “oracle”–āvēsakkāram, tēvarālan, paṭimatton. Freeman 2001:190. Inglis 1985:90–91; for a similar list see Diehl 1956:221ff. Inglis studied the similarities between possession dancers and the local manufacture of clay images, both serving as vessels for the divine. We have seen this image of the possessed as a vessel in Tibetan and in Tulu, via Sanskrit. Doubtless it occurs elsewhere in South Asia as well and is a common image elsewhere in the world. For example, Spanish attests vasos preferidos (chosen vessels) and cajitas (little boxes), for those who accept certain spirits for oracular and curative purposes; cf. Kay F. Turner 1992:126. Lawrence 2003. Maloney 1980:242. Ibid.:242ff.; for more on the evil eye in the Maldives, see pp. 258ff. This is not unlike a brujo in Mexico. On the evil eye in Sri Lanka, see Wirz 1954:178f. On Telugu, see Knipe 2001. He observes that the Telugu word for “possession speech” is vakku (cf. the observation by Lawrence in Sri Lanka) and that “possession ritualists who have one or more neighborhood goddesses ‘come to’ or ‘come on’ them, to employ common Telugu parlance for possession [is] an event also known substantively by the word pūnakam” (p. 344). In a more recent article (2004), Knipe states, importantly, that “Godavari Brahmans are reluctant to mention āveśa, samāveśa, or related experiences, whereas pūnakam, the moment when Ammavāru or a deceased person descends on the occupant of a gaddi [a ‘seat’ for a possession ritualist, shared with the goddess], is eagerly discussed by all ritualists who claim routine divine visitation, as well as by their clients and assembled audiences who share each detail with the village and town folk at large” (p. 440). See also Nuckolls (1991a), who mentions that in Telugu a person on or in whose body a deity comes is called bhaktudù (m) or bhakturàlu (f) (&lt; Skt. bhakta; a devotee). I suspect that these words have broader semantic fields. However, see the 1961 edition of the Broach (present-day Bharuch) district gazetteer (123ff.). Spirits are referred to as bhūts, as is the case all over northern India, the word for possession is vaḷgan. Spirits are divided into family or household spirits (bharṇābhūt) and outside spirits (baharṇābhūt). If a man remarries after the death of his first wife, it is believed that the spirit of the first wife might possess the second. However, if post-mortem rites are properly performed, the spirit will be pacified. An array of spirits and goddesses of lower-caste Hindus are believed to be responsible for the possession. More fieldwork must be done on possession in Gujarat to fill out this very thin picture. See, for example, Troisi 1976, which lists more than five hundred studies of this “tribe,” as it is still classified, of Bengal, Orissa, and Bihar, most of them in English, in many of which, doubtless, one can find references to spirit possession. Nevertheless, I am reminded by William Sax that though “everyone gets possessed, high caste and low, upper caste people tend to deny it of themselves [at least in Garhwal], and attribute it to the subalterns” (personal communication, November 1999). This he attributes to brahmanical image-conjuring rather than suppression, though he does see an effort of Hindu nationalists to suppress possession and other kinds of popular Hinduism. This prurience is little different from that of their detested Victorian predecessors. Pakaslahti has hard evidence to back up Sax’s observations: “Seeking help from Bālājī is not related to illiteracy, low caste status or rural domicile, as the majority of the clientele has average or better than average education, belong to the higher castes and are of urban domicile” (1998:164). Ramanujan 1986a:69. Knipe notes that vaidika brahmans in the community he has studied in coastal Andhra Pradesh do “not enter into a heightened state of consciousness after drinking soma.” Yet they are “well aware of the emotional rhetoric of transformation, most dramatically in the large-scale sharing of soma in a śrauta sacrifice such as the vājapeya, pauṇḍarīka, sarvatomukha or the currently rare agniṣṭoma for a newly initiated member of the soma society” (2004:438). For example, the presence in the Draupadī cult’s Mahābhārata of a Muslim devotee, Muttāl Rāvuttaṉ, who serves Draupadī by accepting blood sacrifices for her and receiving impure offerings, including gāñjā, opium, cigars, and arrack. At one temple, red and green chili peppers are offered to his dog. Cf. Hiltebeitel 1988:101–127. It is difficult to imagine a more non-brahmanical Mahābhārata. Cf. Prabhu 1977; Honko 1998:389–421; also Knipe 1989. It is important not to commit the error of assuming that because the vocabulary of possession in northern India is in a large number of instances derived from Sanskrit, while in southern India it is less the case, possession in the north is more inclusive of upper classes. North Indian languages are Indo-Aryan while south Indian languages are not, so the idiom of possession in the north would “naturally” be more Sanskritic. Similarly, the presence of a Dravidian vocabulary for possession in the south cannot be used as evidence that the possession is somehow non-brahmanical. Correlation of language with culture is an idea that is dying all too slowly; one would have thought that this would have ceased sixty-five years ago with the publication of Frans Boas’s Race, Language and Culture (1940). Note the superannuation of the term aṇaṅku in present-day Tamil (or Malayalam) by the concept (and term) śakti. Cf. Jones 1968. See now Davidson 2002 for a wealth of evidence that tribal practices influenced the development of Mahāyāna Buddhism in the first millennium C.E. Berglie 1996. This epic is still transmitted largely orally, through bards of virtually every stratum of Tibetan society. No standard edition of the text exists, nor is one likely to be produced anytime soon. Geoffrey Samuel has also done important work on the traditions and shamanic dimensions of the Gesar epic; see Samuel 1991, 1994, 2005. Ibid.:17. I agree with Gellner (2001), following Dumont and Pocock, that “it is probably better to talk only of Great Traditions, which certainly exist, and to contrast them with ‘popular religion.’ To call the latter a Little Tradition either appears to imply that it is organized in the same way as the Great Traditions (which it is not) or that it constitutes a pool of survivals of pre-Hindu or pre-textual practices (which is doubtful)” (p. 100). Here I equate “folk” with Gellner’s “popular religion.” Cf. Rigopoulos 1993:54n18. Rigopoulos reports that a devotee of Sai Baba, possessed by Khaṇḍobā, supplied information on Sai Baba’s personal history (47f., 53f.) (which, unfortunately, Rigopoulos accepts as pramāṇa). Sontheimer (1989a, 1989b, and elsewhere) also supports the folk vs. classical Hinduism dichotomy. But the dichotomy Sontheimer writes about is based only on recent historical and contemporary arrangements. Cf. Gellner 2001:203. For certain spiritual practices (upāsana) that involve possession of Hanumān, see Śrīmālī n.d. Gellner writes: “a Maharjan (Farmer) man from a village south of Lalitpur who appeared one day in Kwā Bāhāḥ (an important Buddhist sacred complex) and claimed to be possessed by Kwābāju, i.e. Śākyamuni Buddha, was met with polite but definite scepticism” (2001:211). For a description of a spirit medium who “dances” Śākyamuni Buddha in contemporary Singapore, see DeBernardi 1995:158. See Holt 2004a, 2004b for Viṣṇu possession in Sri Lanka; and Gellner 1988 [2001:102] on the possession of the king of Nepal: “He was considered to be like Vishnu and to be possessed by him in ritual contexts.” See also Dietrich 1998:236, for an account of a Nepali healer who claims possession by Brahmā, Viṣṇu, and Śiva, among others. Not only is the latter apparent from much of the evidence presented in this volume, but one of the primary areas of Indological study in the twentieth century was the determination of Aryan and non-Aryan in early Sanskrit literature. See, for example, Deshpande 1995. Cf. Hiltebeitel 1991. Erndl states: In reading about South Asia, one often gets the impression that possession, along with related ecstatic behavior, belongs to the “little tradition” and is thus largely confined to the lower castes and the poor and uneducated in rural areas. However, in my experience, the phenomenon of possession in the cult of Śerāṇvālī is widespread throughout the population. I have witnessed Goddess possession in both village and urban settings, among low and high castes (including Brahmins), the poor and the rich, the uneducated and the educated, Sikhs as well as Hindus. (1996:179) Bell argues that ritualization is not a “standardized process” of traditionalization, but that: [r]itual can be a strategic way to “traditionalize,” that is, to construct a type of tradition, but in so doing it can also challenge and renegotiate the very basis of tradition to the point of upending much of what has been seen as fixed previously or by other groups. Examples abound, ranging from the ascetic internalization of the Vedic sacrifice and the iconoclasm of early Ch’an Buddhism to the Reformation’s challenge to papal authority through a recreation of the free outpouring of the spirit to the early church. (1992:124) For an accessible general discussion of this, see Bryant 2001, ch. 5. As I write this in Iowa, I am surrounded by the states of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, Missouri, South Dakota and Nebraska, while the best-known place names in the region are those of the Mississippi River and the city of Chicago. All of these are Native American names, the total number of which by now surely exceeds the number of Native Americans in these areas who have any knowledge of their ancestral languages. Although an extreme example, it is nevertheless not wholly dissimilar to the results found elsewhere of linguistic and cultural contact. Mayaram 2000. See F. Smith 1987:59–63, 121–223. See Pollock 1990. Dirks 1992:231. Possession within epic or other narrativized ritual performance in south India yields rather similar results; cf. Hiltebeitel, Brückner, Biardeau, Caldwell, Freeman, and others. Zvelebil 1981:82. See also Stewart 1995:574ff. for a modern story of a faked devotional possession during the life of Haridāsa, a devotee of Śrī Caitanya in the early sixteenth century. Yocum 1982:144.

  <meta name="twitter:title" content="12 NOTES">
  <meta name="twitter:description" content="This is borne out in a study of the bibliographies in an issue of Puruṣārtha devoted to possession; cf. Assayag and Tarabout 1999. The issue contains thirteen articles (excluding the prologue and epilogue), of which five are on Kerala, two each on Himachal Pradesh and Karnataka (one of these on Tulunad), and one each on Rajasthan, Tamilnadu, Nepal, and Kashmir. The brief article on Kashmir is by André Padoux and is the only one in the collection devoted to possession in the premodern period (cf. Chapter 10). These are based on either synonyms or homonyms; see Vogel 1979. Good examples are Sanskrit dictionaries. For example, Monier-Williams’s English-Sanskrit Dictionary (1851) is of no value because it simply has an English word followed by a large number of Sanskrit words, with no effort to contextualize any of them. By contrast, his Sanskrit-English Dictionary (1899) is much better in that he often (but, by no means, always) cites texts from which he draws a word’s meanings. Better still is the seven-volume Sanskrit-Wörterbuch by Böhtlingk and Roth (1855–75). Best is the Deccan College dictionary (Ghatage et al. 1976–), which, after more than half a century of work, including more than three decades of publishing (as of this writing twenty-six fascicles have been published), is about a third of the way through the first letter of the alphabet. Although the completion schedule has become something of a long-running joke, few scholars doubt the validity of the project or, for the most part, its results. Similarly, the Critical Pali Dictionary (Trenckner et al. 1948–90) begun in the nineteenth century is nowhere near completion. Most dictionaries of regional languages are utterly nonhistorical. To be generous, however, historically sensitive lexicography is definitely on the increase. See, for example, Tulpule and Feldhaus 1999, for Marathi, which tries to recognize chronological changes in meaning. Sontheimer 1989b:142ff. Erndl 1996:178. Cf. Korom 1992:275ff. Caturvedi and Tiwari 1975; cf. bhūtabādhā. Erndl 1996:178; also Erndl 1993:108. Wadley writes that khelnā “identifies an active and extreme possession which is manifested by the physical activity of the possessed; khelnā is also used to indicate goddess possession in Karimpur” (1976:237n6). Shukla 1980:167. Gold 1988:38. Pfleiderer and Lutze 1979:111. Freed and Freed 1993:17. Glucklich 1997:49. Many of these are found in rural areas, including Bālājī. This contravenes Dumont and Pocock (1959:56–57), who estimated that healers, as distinguished from oracles, are found only in urban settings in India. See Chapter 12 and F. Smith 2004 for notes on the spirit healing center at Chottanikkara in Kerala. The healing centers at Muslim dargāhs (such as at Badayun, in U.P., south of Bareilfy) and other Sufi-oriented Muslim healing places (such as Matka Pir in Delhi) have clientele that are at least half Hindu. Dwyer’s ethnographic work (1998, 1999, 2003) was primarily on possession and healing in the main temple of Bālājī, while Pakaslahti has been documenting the work of a healer (bhagat) who conducts his sessions at one of the shrines near the temple. Bālājī has experienced exponential growth in the past twenty-five years, since Kakar was there. Pakaslahti estimates that the better known of the many healers there have hundreds of patients, who are often treated simultaneously. Most of these healers come to Bālājī for regular brief visits from other cities in north India (personal communication); also see Pakaslahti 2005. Much of the following description is based on my own observations at the shrine that Pakaslahti has studied, augmented by Pakaslahti’s explanations; cf. Pakaslahti 1998:146ff. The tactics of exorcism at Bālājī vary so greatly that it is certain that some of what I observed does not occur at all of its exorcism and healing clinics. Conversely, some of the tactics employed at these other centers are not employed in the adālat that I observed. For a vivid depiction of one healing, see a video for which Pakaslahti was the primary research and scientific advisor: Kusum, by Jouko Aaltonen (Illume Co., 69 minutes; Helsinki, 2000). Dwyer 1998:7. The emerging work of Bellamy (2004) at Husain Tekri shows that this image has a broad and varied distribution in northern and western India. This is a common genre of popular music in contemporary India. A Sikh family was also present when I was there and responded similarly. Dwyer 1999:113. Cf. Obeyesekere 1981; Hiltebeitel 1988, 1991. Dwyer notes: “I was told that the possessed frequently experience a choking sensation (galā bhar ānā), a contraction of the muscles in the throat, and/or a sense of being bound up (bandha); and informants commented that these are the reasons why tight-fitting garments are loosened before, and sometimes during, the ritual, and why a woman’s hair must be untied” (1999:113). See Davis 2001:99ff., and the discussion in Chapter 11, for surrogate possession in eighth- to twelfth-century China. Davis’s important study seeks to free possession (pingfu [to lean on and adhere to]) from its “shamanic substrate” and bring it to the center of Chinese religious practice, as the present effort aims to do for India. Davis, to the detriment of his otherwise tight and groundbreaking study, rarely refers to anthropological theory or other situated studies, at least in English. For example, his acceptance of Rouget’s definition of possession as merely “a trance of identification” (ibid.:1, 84) is often inadequate, even for his material. Nevertheless, he does refer to many studies in French and Japanese, lest anyone assume (as Janice Boddy has, apparently) that English is the sole authoritative language for the study of possession. Also important for Chinese religion is Teiser 1988. He makes a case for placing spirit possession within the “shamanic substrate” (to which Davis reacts). He writes that “the shaman is one who has special mastery over shen—spirits from afar, his own spirit, and spirituality in general. The shaman’s special access to shen, then, implies that his mediumship works both ways: he can be possessed by spirits, and he is an adept at soul journeys” (p. 145). In fact, Chinese elites—Buddhist, Confucian, and Daoist—placed these wu (shamanic practitioners) in a substrate. But these are disputes that I am hardly qualified to enter. For a somewhat similar situation, see Werbner and Basu 1998:15, where a dargāh is thought of as a Mughal court presided over by a dead saint, potent with charisma, but whose primary minister is a sajjāda. Again, here we have examples of a debate between healer and jinn, where the person’s body is the battleground between the sajjāda and the client. One of the Sanskrit manuscripts on possession on which I base my discussion in Chapter 11 below employs the compound kapisainyaprakāra, indicating that one is invoking not only Hanumān but also the army of monkeys (kapisainya) that assisted him in his invasion of Laṇkā. The phauj here is thus evocative not only of the Rāmāyaṇa but of other possession complexes in India. For another example of this, in what must be regarded as an extended South Asian religious complex, see Bertrand 2004 on the conversion of “errant” Khmer spirits in Cambodia known as brāy to Buddhist pāramī, spirits who exhibit the Buddhist perfections (Skt. paramā). See also Vogt 1999, discussed below. “She” because the assistant in this “clinic” was a sensitive woman named Meena who was herself a former patient who came to this work after a series of traumatic events befell her life leading to a nearly total psychological collapse. See also Trawick 1992:153, for a roughly similar instance, a woman who had experienced possession of Māriamman when she was young who then became a spirit healer only after a near fatal bout of tuberculosis. Pakaslahti 1998:143. Parry states that in Varanasi, at least, a healer and assistant who work together are recognized by certain specific terms: “The ojhā lures and entraps the ghosts, while the sokhā supervises his efforts and is the real expert in identification” (p. 236, diacritics added). The situation was not quite the same at Bālājī. For a similar process of questioning the spirit in more Islamic-centered possession, see Nasir 1987:165f. For a Buddhist context, see Vogt’s findings in Sri Lanka (below). I am here reminded of a description of an exorcism found in Philostratus’s life of Apollonius of Tyana (Philostratus 1970). Philostratus probably finished writing this text in 220 C.E., while Apollonius, one of the earliest travelers from Greece to India, probably lived in the mid- to late first century C.E. There is no possibility of linking through any recoverable tradition the practice that Apollonius describes with practices in contemporary India. Nevertheless, the passage is of such interest that it is worth quoting in full: In the middle of this conversation, the Wise Men were interrupted by the messenger bringing some Indians who needed cures. For instance, he brought forward a woman praying to them on her son’s behalf. He was sixteen years old, she said, but had been possessed for two years by a spirit with a shy, deceitful character. One of the wise men asked what her evidence was, and she said, “This boy of mine is rather handsome in appearance, and the spirit is in love with him. He will not allow him to be rational, or go to school or to archery-training, or to stay at home either, but carries him off to deserted places. My boy no longer has his natural voice but speaks in deep, ringing tones like a man; his eyes, too, are someone else’s than his own. All this makes me weep and tear my hair, and I scold my son as you would expect, but he does not recognize me. But when I decided on this journey, which I did a year ago, the spirit confessed who he was, using my son as a medium. He said he was the ghost of a man who formerly died in war, still very much in love with his wife; but the woman broke their marriage bond three days after his death by marrying another man, and from that time, he said, he had loathed the love of women and had transferred his affection to my son. And he promised that if I did not accuse him before you he would give many wonderful presents to the boy; and this rather made me change my mind. But he has been keeping me waiting for a long time now, acting as sole master of my house, with his wicked, deceitful ways.” The Wise Man then asked her if the boy was with her, but she said, “No: I did everything to make him come, but that spirit threatened me with mention of ‘cliffs’ and ‘abysses,’ saying he would kill my son if I accused him here.” “Don’t worry,” said the Wise Man; “he will not kill him when he has read this,” and he brought a letter out of his pocket and gave it to the woman; it was addressed to the spirit, and contained threats and warnings. (pp. 83–84) This story has many of the elements of what may be found today, including a setting of family therapy, decided dysfunctionality and marked changes in behavior by the individual possessed, identification of the offending spirit, and threats and warnings by the exorcist. Cf. Hiltebeitel 1989a and Mayer’s study of the phenomenon in the Nyingmapa sect of Tibetan Buddhism (1996:109–132). In the latter case, Śiva as Bhairava and Rudra/Maheśvara is tamed and converted to Buddhism. For more on the cuṛail, see Chapter 12. Pakaslahti, personal communication October 2001. See Pakaslahti 1998:139. Dwyer (1998:11ff.) statistically analyzed the results of interviews with 734 patients or their caregivers. He discovered that 35 percent of women and 26 percent of men believed their afflictions were caused by bhūt-prets and that half of both female and male respondents believed that they were harmed by occult practitioners. The biggest differential was between married and single persons: “68 per cent of married persons as opposed to 28 per cent of single persons, in fact, accused their enemies of directly harming them by means of sorcery” (p. 12). Dwyer has much to say about this. Information from Pakaslahti, confirmed by my own observations. I am indebted to him for taking me to Bālājī in April 2001. Casual visitors to Bālājī may examine the immediate surroundings of the main temple, including the pitṛsthān behind it. On a wide dirt track immediately behind the temple, the visitor may see on any day a fairly large number of people with large heavy stones either balanced on their heads or placed on several parts of their supine bodies. These are meant to press on the bhūt-prets in order to help expel them from the victims’ bodies. These stones are clearly much heavier than an ordinary person could bear. The victims might remain motionless in those positions for a few minutes or a few hours before family members struggle to remove the stones. The pitṛsthān rises on a hill behind the temple and resembles a graveyard of stone tumuli. These are, in fact, commemorative stones to deceased ancestors whose possessed and exorcised descendants have placed them there. This is also a site for ordeals. The “clinics” (a very inadequate word) such as I describe here are quite small, consisting of a room or two in houses outside the main temple. Seidel 1987:228. The bureaucratization of celestial regions and netherworlds in China has long been a source of discussion; see Nickerson 1996. Davis 2001:61. Ibid.:95. Davis comments (101ff.) on the striking similarity of exorcism rituals with Song dynasty criminal proceedings. Ibid.:2001:106, also 46. The notion of an army of spirits is not unique to India and China. In Uganda this notion has been elevated to real armies, battles for national political control, and mass murder; see Behrend 1999. Davis 2001:45ff. for accounts of the exorcistic services of fashi, a somewhat amorphous class of ritual specialists who could be Daoist priests, laymen, or spirit-mediums. See also Schipper 1993:49ff. on the category of “barefoot master.” The fashi is the lowest-ranking priest in the Daoist hierarchy. He commands spirit militias filled with petty demons, hungry ghosts, and wandering spirits, and his troops “save the people, fight evil, and heal the sick” (ibid.:50). Davis 2001:106. Cf. Shulman 1994:7f Davis 2001:109. Seidel 1987:229. See also Eder 1973:194ff., passim, on the division of the Chinese universe into yin (darkness) and yang (light): “A shen, a good spirit or god, comes from the beneficent half of the universe; a kuei, a demon or spectre from the opposite half. Every good in the world comes from a shen, every evil is inflicted by a kueï” (p. 195). Furthermore, “[a]fter death the soul is helplessly exposed to hordes of spirits” (p. 194). Only through the grace of bodhisattvas can these beings be saved. Note the vague resonance of this with the rationale behind the increasingly popular mass exorcisms of the living in contemporary American Christianity documented by Cuneo 2001. For complex demonologies in the Hindukush, with Indic, Chinese, and Central Asian influence, see Jettmar 1975:219ff. Pakaslahti 1998:132. Goudriaan 1977:145; this is in a collection of Balinese hymns written in very corrupt Sanskrit. Cf. Īśānaśivagurudevapaddhati 43.68. For more on Khaḍgarāvaṇa, see Chapters 10 and 12. Cf. Sen 1971:701–702. Sen gives the etymological meanings of bhar(a) as “weight, load, cargo; full” and of bhara as “to fill up, to thrust in.” These meanings are a short step to possession. Nevertheless, I am unable to find uses of the Sanskrit √bhṛ in the sense of possession; usually it has little meaning beyond the literal “excess, bearing; burden, weight, mass, bulk, fullness.” Hints, such as ṚV 1.60.5, vājaṃbhara, hardly serve as evidence. Östör 1980 notes the Bengali ānanda korā (to make joy), a joy that serves as the “the basis of devotion to and possession by Bhairab, Śiva’s deputy in the gājan” (p. 138). Their merrymaking, their ānanda, is a result of consumption of large quantities of country wine. See also Bellamy’s observation noted in Chapter 2, n. 196. Sen 1971:701. Bhattacharyya 1986:172. Ibid.:59–75, 180–181. Alternative terms for māthār golmāl are māthā-khārāp (bad-head), māthā-garam (hot-head), and the Sanskrit borrowing unmāda (insanity) (p. 65). Maloney (1976:132) adds the Bengali mukh-lāge (evil face). See also Gonda 1969 for a detailed study of early Indian (and Indo-Iranian) notions of the nature and consequences of eye contact. On the evil eye, ághoracakṣuḥ (Ṛgveda 10.85.44), átjfhoreṇa cákṣusā (Atharvaveda 14.2.12), etc., see pp. 33ff. E.g., Netratantra 19.2. As we see in Chapter 12, the curse of the evil eye is quite predominant in this text of the end of the first millennium C.E. I am grateful to Amitava Bhattacharji for this information. On the manifestations of naẓar and its relationship to desire and caste, see Pocock 1992. See also Kapadia 2000:182, for remarks on the evil eye (tirusti &lt; Skt. dṛṣṭi) in Tamil. Without citing sources, Maloney gives two additional Sanskrit words: kudṛṣṭi (weak sight, evil or sinister eye, heterodox opinion or doctrine) and pāpadṛṣṭi (sin-sight). These are, however, common enough in Sanskrit. Cf. Maloney 1976:128. Bhattacharyya 1986:181.

Sontheimer notes that one who is possessed by any of these the gods Birobā, Mhaskobā, and Khaṇḍobā is called devācī jhāḍ (god’s tree) (p. 193). Wadley 1976:238. Wagle records bhūte āṅgī vāḍhu lāglī (became possessed by bhūts), āṅgāt vāḍhlā (possessed), and bhutācā asvār āṇūn (the bhūt was induced to possess) in court documents dated 1812 (1995:197, 211). Stanley 1988:27. Ibid.:57. Ibid.:48. The district gazetteers published throughout India beginning in the 1870s and revised periodically for at least a century are also useful sources for possession. In spite of the normatively brahmanical presentation of religion in some of the volumes (e.g., the Satara District gazetteer), others try to present a more balanced view. For example, the Poona District gazetteer discusses the demigod Vetāḷa, the local demonology, and the ubiquity of belief in spirits and possession in Maharashtra; cf. Gazetteer of Bombay State: Poona District (1954:126–128). Feldhaus 1995:48, cf. also pp. 11–13; and 126ff. for ethnographies. Ibid.:134. Berti 1999:61–97. Berglie 1976:86. Berglie worked with Tibetan refugee communities in Nepal and India in the early 1970s. He does not state that spirit-mediumship among the Tibetan refugees in Nepal is constituted differently from that in Tibet. It is unlikely to have accumulated significant influences from the indigenous Nepali population by that date. Another study of possession and spirit belief among Hindus, Muslims, and Buddhist tribals in central Nepal is by Gaborieau (1975a), who has recorded statements allegedly uttered by members of a class of spirits of the dead, those who suffered accidental death, called bāyu. See also the excellent studies by Crook (1997, 1998) on oracular possession among Ladakhi Buddhists, as well as the shamanic narratives and Buddhist metanarratives that guide the process. Srinivas 1998:134. In western Nepal, Gaborieau (1975b: 158ff) has noted that the word avatār is normally employed for the possession of a deity by a medium. This possession is instigated by a tantric master who calls the deities into the body of the medium. Clearly, there is a greater infusion of Indo-Aryan (IA) terminology in Nepali (an IA language) than there is in Ladakhi. Srinivas 1998:132. See Nagano 2000:587f., for distinctions made between kinds of possessed festival mediums among the Tibetans of northern Tibet and southern Qinghai province, China: “Tibetan people generally judge the greatness of a lha pa on the basis of whether or not he can verbalize the gods’ words. In addition to that, they distinguish a lha pa from a lha pa tshab on the basis of whether he has actually been possessed. They also distinguish between lha (rang) ’bab rgyab ‘the deity itself descends from heavens’ and lha phab/’bebs ‘to make a deity descend.’” See Paper 1995:54ff., 115, for a description of four shamanic specialists in ancient China. It is possible that there is a common ancestry for these groups. Srinivas 1998:126. See Mumford, who renders mi-kha as “envious talk” (1989:140). Considerable information on possession in Nepal is in Hitchcock and Jones 1976; also Samuel 1993:194–196. Höfer 1994. This exemplary work is first and foremost a linguistic study, though this inevitably leads to a “thick description” of Tamang shamanic ritual. The book also includes glossaries of Tamang, Tibetan, and Nepali words. Admirably, Höfer devotes considerable space to explaining his terms. Ibid.:20. See also Gutschow 2004 for this and related shamans and oracles in Ladakh. Ibid.:26–27, 72–74. Bakhtin 1981; cf. Mumford 1989:13ff. Mumford makes extensive use of Bakhtin’s observations (1968, 1984) on Rabelais and Dostoevsky. Spirits are often said to be fond of milk; see the translations of the āyurvedic texts in Chapter 12. Note also in the same chapter the discussion of the Malayalam word kaiviṣa, a kind of poisoning in which spirit possession is involved. Mumford 1989:196ff. Ibid.:144. See also the discussion of the Madanamahārṇava in Chapter 12. Ibid.:148. Mumford adds, “The shaman regards his own exorcisms as more effective for that reason, justifying his own violent rites as the only effective way to expel demons from the community.” Berglie 1982a, also see Berglie 1976, 2000. For more on the dpa’-bo, see p. 304f. For a wealth of material on shamanic healing and possession in northern Tibet, much of which is clearly imprinted on Nepali Buddhist shamanic possession, see Bellezza 2005. Unfortunately, this volume came to me too late to make full use of it. She was a ḍākinī and one of the main consorts of Padmasambhava. It is not without interest that the dpa’-bo call the mirror gling (“world”); cf. Berglie 1976:94. This appears to be consistent with the tenor of Buddhist philosophy. See my extended discussion of this in Chapter 11. See Bellezza 2005:23–28 for an interesting description of a number of Tibetan words for this magical mirror. Berglie 1982b:164. Berglie 2000:30. See also Pettigrew and Tamu (1994), who briefly describe possession among the Gurang of central Nepal. The term for possession in that dialect of Nepali is khhelye khhaba (god has caught, captured, covered) (p. 421n4). Dietrich 1998, esp. pp. 39ff. for demonologies, pp. 160ff. for healing practices. Regrettably, the book does not include an index. An important study of psychiatric treatment from the textual point of view, with a few ethnographic examples, is Clifford 1984. This is discussed extensively in Chapter 12. See also Merz 1996, which describes the goddess Hāratī in the Kathmandu Valley, whose cult has arisen since the mid-twentieth century. Hāratī confers on her devotees oracular possession as well as disease, but also heals. This is consistent with evidence found elsewhere for other deities. See also Diemberger 2005 on various terms for oracles and oracular possession in southern and central Tibet. Cf. Hiltebeitel 1988, 1991, passim, esp. note 1988:275. Cf. R. L.

Klimkeit’s use of term teufelstänz is thus not an accurate translation, but reflects the usage of previous scholarship extending back to the early eighteenth century and Ziegenbalg. Clearly “devil’s dance” is pejorative and must be understood in the context of Protestant missionary activity on the Malabar coast; e.g., Burnell 1894, 1896.

Ibid.:101. Ibid.: 115. Hiltebeitel shows the same resolution of āvēsam in the Draupadī cult in northern Tamilnadu. It is relevant here to cite Bertrand’s 2004 study of spirit possession and Buddhism in Cambodia, because what he finds resembles in part the situation in Sri Lanka. In one important way, however, it is dissimilar. In Cambodia many monks, in addition to laity, undergo possession in which they attempt to convert wayward spirits to Buddhism. This, observes Bertrand, “is a complete infraction of the Vinaya, the code of conduct that regulates the life of monks.… Trance is unacceptable for a monk, as it is proof of the absence of serenity and a lack of behavioural control” (p. 163). Thus many of these monks “chose to [temporarily] defrock rather than break the monastic rules” (ibid.). The situation in Cambodia is unique, however. The large number of new mediums there, both lay and monastic, is often interpreted “as the wish of the Buddha to aid mankind and also to pacify and educate all the souls of the dead killed under Pol Pot” (p. 166). The proximity of Buddhist monks to deity or spirit possession is discussed elsewhere as well; cf. DeCaroli 2004:25ff., 128ff. Yocum 1982:189. It is also important to see the evidence from various first-millennium Tamil sources gathered by Hardy (1983:136–138, passim). Yocum 1982:188ff. Anyone who has read this far would profit by referring to Yocum’s section on possession (pp. 187–194). On the matter of dating, see Tieken’s revisionist view attributing the Caṇkam poetry to the second half of the first millennium C.E. (2001) and Hart’s strong criticism of this view (2004). Both authors argue their cases well. I am not qualified to say which of the two is right. However, I must offer two observations: (1) the consensus remains that the Caṇkam poetry is of the first half of the first millennium C.E. (2) This is important because it is assumed that much of Indian devotional possession deriving from Sanskrit traditions and sources (e.g., from the traditions based on the Bhāgavata Parāṇa) ultimately derives from Tamil texts and religiosity. Tieken proposes to reverse this. If this were true (and I do not see a definitive solution), then the history of devotional, oracular possession would have to be revised, placing the time of its popularization a half a millennium later and its locus more squarely in Sanskritic rather than Tamil religiosity. Hardy comments on the female presence in Tamil possession and ecstatic dancing: “Therefore it may not be accidental that in later bhakti religion, where these forms of worship appear again, the psychology of religious awareness is ‘female’” (1983:140). The south Indian origin of what he rather flatly calls “emotional bhakti” is one of the main themes of Hardy’s Viraha-Bhakti. Vogt 1999:xi. Wirz 1954:14ff.; also Scott 1994:16, passim. Scott 1994:279. Wirz 1954:14ff. Vogt 1999:13. Ibid.:11, table 2. Ibid.:109ff. Ibid.:xi. Exceptions to this perhaps harsh assertion may nevertheless be cited, e.g., Hiltebeitel, Sax, Korom, and certainly others. Vogt’s psychological interpretations (ibid.:74ff.) are indebted to the work of J. L. Moreno, the founder of “sociometry” and “psychodrama.” Her interpretations are intriguing and often convincing. However, she does not support her otherwise good arguments for application of Moreno’s ideas with reasons why Moreno’s psychodrama is more compelling than Freudian or other allied psychoanalytic theories. Moreno, for better or worse, stands beyond the pale of Freudian and other more medicalized systems that dominate psychological perspectives of scholars in the humanities and that have, partly for this reason, achieved greater subtlety and nuancing than Moreno’s views. Ibid.:130. Ibid.:48, yakunte dharmayan ana-kirima (Simhala); see also pp. 84–100. See Walters 2000 for a powerful critique of the uses and misuses of the Pāli vaṃsas by the authors themselves, nationalist Sri Lankans of the nineteenth and twentieth century, and European scholars of the same period. Despite many valuable insights, Walters is much too (fashionably) zealous in stigmatizing the textualists upon whom his own work depends. Scott’s postcolonial positionings are much more sophisticated than Vogt’s. The latter was clearly unfamiliar with Scott’s work. My comments above on the freedom of continental European scholarship to work outside the present trends of post-colonialism, etc., should be tempered by such admissions. Vogt 1999:131. Scott 1994:228. In spite of this, it must be noted, Scott appears to be unaware of what these virtuous commands actually are. Although he adds that aṇaguna “conveys in fact the very force of the Buddha’s moral authority” (p. 25), he appears not to have studied the Buddhism that he admits rests at the basis of this healing process.

A “world peace sacrifice to the goddess” (viśva-śānti-devī-yajña) was performed at that time. All quotations are from pp. 11–15 of the book. I am grateful to Loriliai Biernacki for lending this to me. The Web site www.hindubooks.org/temples/assam/kamakhya/page23.htm states cogently that the festival is “so called because of the tremendous sound produced by the instruments such as drum, dhole, etc.” This argues for a more shamanistic identity of debaddhani. The chapbook says nine are possessed, but Loriliai Biernacki reports that, according to her informants, the number is not fixed, and as many as fifteen have been possessed in previous years. Cf. the descriptions of possession found in the principal āyurvedic texts; see Chapter 12. Wadley 1976:235. Her main sources for these words are Berreman 1963 and Planalp 1956.

Bhattacharyya’s discussion is recommended for its linguistic sensitivity. On Vodoun possession by loa, the local spirits, see Hurston 1938: “The person mounted does nothing of his own accord. He is the horse of the loa until the spirit departs. Under the whip and guidance of the spirit-rider, the ‘horse’ does and says many things he or she would never have uttered un-ridden” (p. 221). phaḍ ity anena mantreṇa tatrāśvārohaṇa viśet | Āgamarahasyam 3899ab, 2:330. Macdonald 1975:327n5, for regional variants of this word. Dietrich 1998:259 and passim, records the word dhami as a rural variant. Viswa Shanti Devi Yajña Committee (2004):15. Cf. Mumford 1989:148n12; also Aziz 1978:52ff. Mumford labels sngags pas as “magicians” who practice “violent” means of exorcism. In this sense, he may be misrepresenting the teachings and practices of sngags pas themselves, but correctly representing the views of local Tibetan villagers in remote parts of Nepal who, over centuries of direct contact and folklore, have come to see them as such. See, for example, the Sanskrit manuscripts on possession discussed in Chapter 11. Although this is correct in its Sanskritic reference, Gellner notes that in Newari the word vaidya refers to “any type of healer who is not directly possessed” (2001:97). See Carstairs and Kapur 1976. Brückner 1995:89ff.; Honko 1998:341. Claus is more specific, stating that this is used for a spirit medium (1979:29). Macdonald 1975:118. Höfer 1994:18. Macdonald’s designation is also too restrictive for Gellner, who, like Höfer, regards a jhṃkri as a shaman in a more general sense; cf. Gellner 1994:31. Ibid.; also Merz 1996:347. Hāratī, the “goddess who steals,” is a Hindu-Buddhist crossover deity. She is worshipped by both Hindus and Buddhists, her temple ritual is performed by Newar Buddhist Vajrācāryas, and she is related to other deities of possession, including her husband Unmatta (“Drunken”) Bhairava and several of their children. Cf. Gellner 1988. Gellner 1994:31 (= 2001:202). Gellner 1994:32 (2001:203). Gellner 1992:326ff. Höfer 1994:17–19. Gaborieau 1975a:73, 76ff. Berglie 1976. Dietrich 1998:119–159. Karim 1988:277–309.

It is of little value to discuss words found in dictionaries without comment or contextualization. Thus it suffices to merely mention that the old standard English and Tamil Dictionary, by Winslow, Spaulding, and Pillai (1888 [1842]), lists the following: under “possession by an evil spirit”–tēvarālan, veṟiyāṭṭu, āvēsam (p. 1019); under “oracle”–āvēsakkāram, tēvarālan, paṭimatton. Freeman 2001:190. Inglis 1985:90–91; for a similar list see Diehl 1956:221ff. Inglis studied the similarities between possession dancers and the local manufacture of clay images, both serving as vessels for the divine. We have seen this image of the possessed as a vessel in Tibetan and in Tulu, via Sanskrit. Doubtless it occurs elsewhere in South Asia as well and is a common image elsewhere in the world. For example, Spanish attests vasos preferidos (chosen vessels) and cajitas (little boxes), for those who accept certain spirits for oracular and curative purposes; cf. Kay F. Turner 1992:126. Lawrence 2003. Maloney 1980:242. Ibid.:242ff.; for more on the evil eye in the Maldives, see pp. 258ff. This is not unlike a brujo in Mexico. On the evil eye in Sri Lanka, see Wirz 1954:178f. On Telugu, see Knipe 2001. He observes that the Telugu word for “possession speech” is vakku (cf. the observation by Lawrence in Sri Lanka) and that “possession ritualists who have one or more neighborhood goddesses ‘come to’ or ‘come on’ them, to employ common Telugu parlance for possession [is] an event also known substantively by the word pūnakam” (p. 344). In a more recent article (2004), Knipe states, importantly, that “Godavari Brahmans are reluctant to mention āveśa, samāveśa, or related experiences, whereas pūnakam, the moment when Ammavāru or a deceased person descends on the occupant of a gaddi [a ‘seat’ for a possession ritualist, shared with the goddess], is eagerly discussed by all ritualists who claim routine divine visitation, as well as by their clients and assembled audiences who share each detail with the village and town folk at large” (p. 440). See also Nuckolls (1991a), who mentions that in Telugu a person on or in whose body a deity comes is called bhaktudù (m) or bhakturàlu (f) (&lt; Skt. bhakta; a devotee). I suspect that these words have broader semantic fields. However, see the 1961 edition of the Broach (present-day Bharuch) district gazetteer (123ff.). Spirits are referred to as bhūts, as is the case all over northern India, the word for possession is vaḷgan. Spirits are divided into family or household spirits (bharṇābhūt) and outside spirits (baharṇābhūt). If a man remarries after the death of his first wife, it is believed that the spirit of the first wife might possess the second. However, if post-mortem rites are properly performed, the spirit will be pacified. An array of spirits and goddesses of lower-caste Hindus are believed to be responsible for the possession. More fieldwork must be done on possession in Gujarat to fill out this very thin picture. See, for example, Troisi 1976, which lists more than five hundred studies of this “tribe,” as it is still classified, of Bengal, Orissa, and Bihar, most of them in English, in many of which, doubtless, one can find references to spirit possession. Nevertheless, I am reminded by William Sax that though “everyone gets possessed, high caste and low, upper caste people tend to deny it of themselves [at least in Garhwal], and attribute it to the subalterns” (personal communication, November 1999). This he attributes to brahmanical image-conjuring rather than suppression, though he does see an effort of Hindu nationalists to suppress possession and other kinds of popular Hinduism. This prurience is little different from that of their detested Victorian predecessors. Pakaslahti has hard evidence to back up Sax’s observations: “Seeking help from Bālājī is not related to illiteracy, low caste status or rural domicile, as the majority of the clientele has average or better than average education, belong to the higher castes and are of urban domicile” (1998:164). Ramanujan 1986a:69. Knipe notes that vaidika brahmans in the community he has studied in coastal Andhra Pradesh do “not enter into a heightened state of consciousness after drinking soma.” Yet they are “well aware of the emotional rhetoric of transformation, most dramatically in the large-scale sharing of soma in a śrauta sacrifice such as the vājapeya, pauṇḍarīka, sarvatomukha or the currently rare agniṣṭoma for a newly initiated member of the soma society” (2004:438). For example, the presence in the Draupadī cult’s Mahābhārata of a Muslim devotee, Muttāl Rāvuttaṉ, who serves Draupadī by accepting blood sacrifices for her and receiving impure offerings, including gāñjā, opium, cigars, and arrack. At one temple, red and green chili peppers are offered to his dog. Cf. Hiltebeitel 1988:101–127. It is difficult to imagine a more non-brahmanical Mahābhārata. Cf. Prabhu 1977; Honko 1998:389–421; also Knipe 1989. It is important not to commit the error of assuming that because the vocabulary of possession in northern India is in a large number of instances derived from Sanskrit, while in southern India it is less the case, possession in the north is more inclusive of upper classes. North Indian languages are Indo-Aryan while south Indian languages are not, so the idiom of possession in the north would “naturally” be more Sanskritic. Similarly, the presence of a Dravidian vocabulary for possession in the south cannot be used as evidence that the possession is somehow non-brahmanical. Correlation of language with culture is an idea that is dying all too slowly; one would have thought that this would have ceased sixty-five years ago with the publication of Frans Boas’s Race, Language and Culture (1940). Note the superannuation of the term aṇaṅku in present-day Tamil (or Malayalam) by the concept (and term) śakti. Cf. Jones 1968. See now Davidson 2002 for a wealth of evidence that tribal practices influenced the development of Mahāyāna Buddhism in the first millennium C.E. Berglie 1996. This epic is still transmitted largely orally, through bards of virtually every stratum of Tibetan society. No standard edition of the text exists, nor is one likely to be produced anytime soon. Geoffrey Samuel has also done important work on the traditions and shamanic dimensions of the Gesar epic; see Samuel 1991, 1994, 2005. Ibid.:17. I agree with Gellner (2001), following Dumont and Pocock, that “it is probably better to talk only of Great Traditions, which certainly exist, and to contrast them with ‘popular religion.’ To call the latter a Little Tradition either appears to imply that it is organized in the same way as the Great Traditions (which it is not) or that it constitutes a pool of survivals of pre-Hindu or pre-textual practices (which is doubtful)” (p. 100). Here I equate “folk” with Gellner’s “popular religion.” Cf. Rigopoulos 1993:54n18. Rigopoulos reports that a devotee of Sai Baba, possessed by Khaṇḍobā, supplied information on Sai Baba’s personal history (47f., 53f.) (which, unfortunately, Rigopoulos accepts as pramāṇa). Sontheimer (1989a, 1989b, and elsewhere) also supports the folk vs. classical Hinduism dichotomy. But the dichotomy Sontheimer writes about is based only on recent historical and contemporary arrangements. Cf. Gellner 2001:203. For certain spiritual practices (upāsana) that involve possession of Hanumān, see Śrīmālī n.d. Gellner writes: “a Maharjan (Farmer) man from a village south of Lalitpur who appeared one day in Kwā Bāhāḥ (an important Buddhist sacred complex) and claimed to be possessed by Kwābāju, i.e. Śākyamuni Buddha, was met with polite but definite scepticism” (2001:211). For a description of a spirit medium who “dances” Śākyamuni Buddha in contemporary Singapore, see DeBernardi 1995:158. See Holt 2004a, 2004b for Viṣṇu possession in Sri Lanka; and Gellner 1988 [2001:102] on the possession of the king of Nepal: “He was considered to be like Vishnu and to be possessed by him in ritual contexts.” See also Dietrich 1998:236, for an account of a Nepali healer who claims possession by Brahmā, Viṣṇu, and Śiva, among others. Not only is the latter apparent from much of the evidence presented in this volume, but one of the primary areas of Indological study in the twentieth century was the determination of Aryan and non-Aryan in early Sanskrit literature. See, for example, Deshpande 1995. Cf. Hiltebeitel 1991. Erndl states: In reading about South Asia, one often gets the impression that possession, along with related ecstatic behavior, belongs to the “little tradition” and is thus largely confined to the lower castes and the poor and uneducated in rural areas. However, in my experience, the phenomenon of possession in the cult of Śerāṇvālī is widespread throughout the population. I have witnessed Goddess possession in both village and urban settings, among low and high castes (including Brahmins), the poor and the rich, the uneducated and the educated, Sikhs as well as Hindus. (1996:179) Bell argues that ritualization is not a “standardized process” of traditionalization, but that: [r]itual can be a strategic way to “traditionalize,” that is, to construct a type of tradition, but in so doing it can also challenge and renegotiate the very basis of tradition to the point of upending much of what has been seen as fixed previously or by other groups. Examples abound, ranging from the ascetic internalization of the Vedic sacrifice and the iconoclasm of early Ch’an Buddhism to the Reformation’s challenge to papal authority through a recreation of the free outpouring of the spirit to the early church. (1992:124) For an accessible general discussion of this, see Bryant 2001, ch. 5. As I write this in Iowa, I am surrounded by the states of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, Missouri, South Dakota and Nebraska, while the best-known place names in the region are those of the Mississippi River and the city of Chicago. All of these are Native American names, the total number of which by now surely exceeds the number of Native Americans in these areas who have any knowledge of their ancestral languages. Although an extreme example, it is nevertheless not wholly dissimilar to the results found elsewhere of linguistic and cultural contact. Mayaram 2000. See F. Smith 1987:59–63, 121–223. See Pollock 1990. Dirks 1992:231. Possession within epic or other narrativized ritual performance in south India yields rather similar results; cf. Hiltebeitel, Brückner, Biardeau, Caldwell, Freeman, and others. Zvelebil 1981:82. See also Stewart 1995:574ff. for a modern story of a faked devotional possession during the life of Haridāsa, a devotee of Śrī Caitanya in the early sixteenth century. Yocum 1982:144. There is earlier testimony for this in the Mahābhārata tale of Aśvatthāman, discussed in Chapter 6.">

<li>This is borne out in a study of the bibliographies in an issue of Puruṣārtha devoted to possession; cf. Assayag and Tarabout 1999. The issue contains thirteen articles (excluding the prologue and epilogue), of which five are on Kerala, two each on Himachal Pradesh and Karnataka (one of these on Tulunad), and one each on Rajasthan, Tamilnadu, Nepal, and Kashmir. The brief article on Kashmir is by André Padoux and is the only one in the collection devoted to possession in the premodern period (cf. Chapter 10).</li>
<li>These are based on either synonyms or homonyms; see Vogel 1979.</li>
<li>Good examples are Sanskrit dictionaries. For example, Monier-Williams’s English-Sanskrit Dictionary (1851) is of no value because it simply has an English word followed by a large number of Sanskrit words, with no effort to contextualize any of them. By contrast, his Sanskrit-English Dictionary (1899) is much better in that he often (but, by no means, always) cites texts from which he draws a word’s meanings. Better still is the seven-volume Sanskrit-Wörterbuch by Böhtlingk and Roth (1855–75). Best is the Deccan College dictionary (Ghatage et al. 1976–), which, after more than half a century of work, including more than three decades of publishing (as of this writing twenty-six fascicles have been published), is about a third of the way through the first letter of the alphabet. Although the completion schedule has become something of a long-running joke, few scholars doubt the validity of the project or, for the most part, its results. Similarly, the Critical Pali Dictionary (Trenckner et al. 1948–90) begun in the nineteenth century is nowhere near completion. Most dictionaries of regional languages are utterly nonhistorical. To be generous, however, historically sensitive lexicography is definitely on the increase. See, for example, Tulpule and Feldhaus 1999, for Marathi, which tries to recognize chronological changes in meaning.</li>

<li>Many of these are found in rural areas, including Bālājī. This contravenes Dumont and Pocock (1959:56–57), who estimated that healers, as distinguished from oracles, are found only in urban settings in India. See Chapter 12 and F. Smith 2004 for notes on the spirit healing center at Chottanikkara in Kerala.</li>
<li>The healing centers at Muslim dargāhs (such as at Badayun, in U.P., south of Bareilfy) and other Sufi-oriented Muslim healing places (such as Matka Pir in Delhi) have clientele that are at least half Hindu.</li>
<li>Dwyer’s ethnographic work (1998, 1999, 2003) was primarily on possession and healing in the main temple of Bālājī, while Pakaslahti has been documenting the work of a healer (bhagat) who conducts his sessions at one of the shrines near the temple. Bālājī has experienced exponential growth in the past twenty-five years, since Kakar was there. Pakaslahti estimates that the better known of the many healers there have hundreds of patients, who are often treated simultaneously. Most of these healers come to Bālājī for regular brief visits from other cities in north India (personal communication); also see Pakaslahti 2005.</li>
<li>Much of the following description is based on my own observations at the shrine that Pakaslahti has studied, augmented by Pakaslahti’s explanations; cf. Pakaslahti 1998:146ff. The tactics of exorcism at Bālājī vary so greatly that it is certain that some of what I observed does not occur at all of its exorcism and healing clinics. Conversely, some of the tactics employed at these other centers are not employed in the adālat that I observed. For a vivid depiction of one healing, see a video for which Pakaslahti was the primary research and scientific advisor: Kusum, by Jouko Aaltonen (Illume Co., 69 minutes; Helsinki, 2000).</li>
<li>Dwyer 1998:7.</li>
<li>The emerging work of Bellamy (2004) at Husain Tekri shows that this image has a broad and varied distribution in northern and western India.</li>
<li>This is a common genre of popular music in contemporary India.</li>
<li>A Sikh family was also present when I was there and responded similarly.</li>
<li>Dwyer 1999:113.</li>
<li>Cf. Obeyesekere 1981; Hiltebeitel 1988, 1991. Dwyer notes: “I was told that the possessed frequently experience a choking sensation (galā bhar ānā), a contraction of the muscles in the throat, and/or a sense of being bound up (bandha); and informants commented that these are the reasons why tight-fitting garments are loosened before, and sometimes during, the ritual, and why a woman’s hair must be untied” (1999:113).</li>
<li>See Davis 2001:99ff., and the discussion in Chapter 11, for surrogate possession in eighth- to twelfth-century China. Davis’s important study seeks to free possession (pingfu [to lean on and adhere to]) from its “shamanic substrate” and bring it to the center of Chinese religious practice, as the present effort aims to do for India. Davis, to the detriment of his otherwise tight and groundbreaking study, rarely refers to anthropological theory or other situated studies, at least in English. For example, his acceptance of Rouget’s definition of possession as merely “a trance of identification” (ibid.:1, 84) is often inadequate, even for his material. Nevertheless, he does refer to many studies in French and Japanese, lest anyone assume (as Janice Boddy has, apparently) that English is the sole authoritative language for the study of possession. Also important for Chinese religion is Teiser 1988. He makes a case for placing spirit possession within the “shamanic substrate” (to which Davis reacts). He writes that “the shaman is one who has special mastery over shen—spirits from afar, his own spirit, and spirituality in general. The shaman’s special access to shen, then, implies that his mediumship works both ways: he can be possessed by spirits, and he is an adept at soul journeys” (p. 145). In fact, Chinese elites—Buddhist, Confucian, and Daoist—placed these wu (shamanic practitioners) in a substrate. But these are disputes that I am hardly qualified to enter.</li>
<li>For a somewhat similar situation, see Werbner and Basu 1998:15, where a dargāh is thought of as a Mughal court presided over by a dead saint, potent with charisma, but whose primary minister is a sajjāda. Again, here we have examples of a debate between healer and jinn, where the person’s body is the battleground between the sajjāda and the client.</li>
<li>One of the Sanskrit manuscripts on possession on which I base my discussion in Chapter 11 below employs the compound kapisainyaprakāra, indicating that one is invoking not only Hanumān but also the army of monkeys (kapisainya) that assisted him in his invasion of Laṇkā. The phauj here is thus evocative not only of the Rāmāyaṇa but of other possession complexes in India.</li>
<li>For another example of this, in what must be regarded as an extended South Asian religious complex, see Bertrand 2004 on the conversion of “errant” Khmer spirits in Cambodia known as brāy to Buddhist pāramī, spirits who exhibit the Buddhist perfections (Skt. paramā). See also Vogt 1999, discussed below.</li>
<li>“She” because the assistant in this “clinic” was a sensitive woman named Meena who was herself a former patient who came to this work after a series of traumatic events befell her life leading to a nearly total psychological collapse. See also Trawick 1992:153, for a roughly similar instance, a woman who had experienced possession of Māriamman when she was young who then became a spirit healer only after a near fatal bout of tuberculosis.</li>
<li>Pakaslahti 1998:143. Parry states that in Varanasi, at least, a healer and assistant who work together are recognized by certain specific terms: “The ojhā lures and entraps the ghosts, while the sokhā supervises his efforts and is the real expert in identification” (p. 236, diacritics added). The situation was not quite the same at Bālājī.</li>
<li>For a similar process of questioning the spirit in more Islamic-centered possession, see Nasir 1987:165f. For a Buddhist context, see Vogt’s findings in Sri Lanka (below).</li>
<li>I am here reminded of a description of an exorcism found in Philostratus’s life of Apollonius of Tyana (Philostratus 1970). Philostratus probably finished writing this text in 220 C.E., while Apollonius, one of the earliest travelers from Greece to India, probably lived in the mid- to late first century C.E. There is no possibility of linking through any recoverable tradition the practice that Apollonius describes with practices in contemporary India. Nevertheless, the passage is of such interest that it is worth quoting in full:
In the middle of this conversation, the Wise Men were interrupted by the messenger bringing some Indians who needed cures. For instance, he brought forward a woman praying to them on her son’s behalf. He was sixteen years old, she said, but had been possessed for two years by a spirit with a shy, deceitful character. One of the wise men asked what her evidence was, and she said, “This boy of mine is rather handsome in appearance, and the spirit is in love with him. He will not allow him to be rational, or go to school or to archery-training, or to stay at home either, but carries him off to deserted places. My boy no longer has his natural voice but speaks in deep, ringing tones like a man; his eyes, too, are someone else’s than his own. All this makes me weep and tear my hair, and I scold my son as you would expect, but he does not recognize me. But when I decided on this journey, which I did a year ago, the spirit confessed who he was, using my son as a medium. He said he was the ghost of a man who formerly died in war, still very much in love with his wife; but the woman broke their marriage bond three days after his death by marrying another man, and from that time, he said, he had loathed the love of women and had transferred his affection to my son. And he promised that if I did not accuse him before you he would give many wonderful presents to the boy; and this rather made me change my mind. But he has been keeping me waiting for a long time now, acting as sole master of my house, with his wicked, deceitful ways.”
The Wise Man then asked her if the boy was with her, but she said, “No: I did everything to make him come, but that spirit threatened me with mention of ‘cliffs’ and ‘abysses,’ saying he would kill my son if I accused him here.”
“Don’t worry,” said the Wise Man; “he will not kill him when he has read this,” and he brought a letter out of his pocket and gave it to the woman; it was addressed to the spirit, and contained threats and warnings. (pp. 83–84)
This story has many of the elements of what may be found today, including a setting of family therapy, decided dysfunctionality and marked changes in behavior by the individual possessed, identification of the offending spirit, and threats and warnings by the exorcist.</li>
<li>Cf. Hiltebeitel 1989a and Mayer’s study of the phenomenon in the Nyingmapa sect of Tibetan Buddhism (1996:109–132). In the latter case, Śiva as Bhairava and Rudra/Maheśvara is tamed and converted to Buddhism.</li>

<li>Pakaslahti, personal communication October 2001.</li>
<li>See Pakaslahti 1998:139. Dwyer (1998:11ff.) statistically analyzed the results of interviews with 734 patients or their caregivers. He discovered that 35 percent of women and 26 percent of men believed their afflictions were caused by bhūt-prets and that half of both female and male respondents believed that they were harmed by occult practitioners. The biggest differential was between married and single persons: “68 per cent of married persons as opposed to 28 per cent of single persons, in fact, accused their enemies of directly harming them by means of sorcery” (p. 12). Dwyer has much to say about this.</li>
<li>Information from Pakaslahti, confirmed by my own observations. I am indebted to him for taking me to Bālājī in April 2001. Casual visitors to Bālājī may examine the immediate surroundings of the main temple, including the pitṛsthān behind it. On a wide dirt track immediately behind the temple, the visitor may see on any day a fairly large number of people with large heavy stones either balanced on their heads or placed on several parts of their supine bodies. These are meant to press on the bhūt-prets in order to help expel them from the victims’ bodies. These stones are clearly much heavier than an ordinary person could bear. The victims might remain motionless in those positions for a few minutes or a few hours before family members struggle to remove the stones. The pitṛsthān rises on a hill behind the temple and resembles a graveyard of stone tumuli. These are, in fact, commemorative stones to deceased ancestors whose possessed and exorcised descendants have placed them there. This is also a site for ordeals. The “clinics” (a very inadequate word) such as I describe here are quite small, consisting of a room or two in houses outside the main temple.</li>

See also Schipper 1993:49ff. on the category of “barefoot master.” The fashi is the lowest-ranking priest in the Daoist hierarchy. He commands spirit militias filled with petty demons, hungry ghosts, and wandering spirits, and his troops “save the people, fight evil, and heal the sick” (ibid.:50).</li>

<li>Seidel 1987:229. See also Eder 1973:194ff., passim, on the division of the Chinese universe into yin (darkness) and yang (light): “A shen, a good spirit or god, comes from the beneficent half of the universe; a kuei, a demon or spectre from the opposite half. Every good in the world comes from a shen, every evil is inflicted by a kueï” (p. 195). Furthermore, “[a]fter death the soul is helplessly exposed to hordes of spirits” (p. 194). Only through the grace of bodhisattvas can these beings be saved. Note the vague resonance of this with the rationale behind the increasingly popular mass exorcisms of the living in contemporary American Christianity documented by Cuneo 2001.

<li>Cf. Sen 1971:701–702. Sen gives the etymological meanings of bhar(a) as “weight, load, cargo; full” and of bhara as “to fill up, to thrust in.” These meanings are a short step to possession. Nevertheless, I am unable to find uses of the Sanskrit √bhṛ in the sense of possession; usually it has little meaning beyond the literal “excess, bearing; burden, weight, mass, bulk, fullness.” Hints, such as ṚV 1.60.5, vājaṃbhara, hardly serve as evidence. Östör 1980 notes the Bengali ānanda korā (to make joy), a joy that serves as the “the basis of devotion to and possession by Bhairab, Śiva’s deputy in the gājan” (p. 138). Their merrymaking, their ānanda, is a result of consumption of large quantities of country wine. See also Bellamy’s observation noted in Chapter 2, n. 196.</li>

In spite of the normatively brahmanical presentation of religion in some of the volumes (e.g., the Satara District gazetteer), others try to present a more balanced view. For example, the Poona District gazetteer discusses the demigod Vetāḷa, the local demonology, and the ubiquity of belief in spirits and possession in Maharashtra; cf. Gazetteer of Bombay State: Poona District (1954:126–128).</li>

<li>Berglie 1976:86. Berglie worked with Tibetan refugee communities in Nepal and India in the early 1970s. He does not state that spirit-mediumship among the Tibetan refugees in Nepal is constituted differently from that in Tibet. It is unlikely to have accumulated significant influences from the indigenous Nepali population by that date.</li>
<li>Another study of possession and spirit belief among Hindus, Muslims, and Buddhist tribals in central Nepal is by Gaborieau (1975a), who has recorded statements allegedly uttered by members of a class of spirits of the dead, those who suffered accidental death, called bāyu. See also the excellent studies by Crook (1997, 1998) on oracular possession among Ladakhi Buddhists, as well as the shamanic narratives and Buddhist metanarratives that guide the process.</li>
<li>Srinivas 1998:134.</li>
<li>In western Nepal, Gaborieau (1975b: 158ff) has noted that the word avatār is normally employed for the possession of a deity by a medium. This possession is instigated by a tantric master who calls the deities into the body of the medium. Clearly, there is a greater infusion of Indo-Aryan (IA) terminology in Nepali (an IA language) than there is in Ladakhi.</li>
<li>Srinivas 1998:132. See Nagano 2000:587f., for distinctions made between kinds of possessed festival mediums among the Tibetans of northern Tibet and southern Qinghai province, China: “Tibetan people generally judge the greatness of a lha pa on the basis of whether or not he can verbalize the gods’ words. In addition to that, they distinguish a lha pa from a lha pa tshab on the basis of whether he has actually been possessed. They also distinguish between lha (rang) ’bab rgyab ‘the deity itself descends from heavens’ and lha phab/’bebs ‘to make a deity descend.’” See Paper 1995:54ff., 115, for a description of four shamanic specialists in ancient China. It is possible that there is a common ancestry for these groups.</li>

<li>It is relevant here to cite Bertrand’s 2004 study of spirit possession and Buddhism in Cambodia, because what he finds resembles in part the situation in Sri Lanka. In one important way, however, it is dissimilar. In Cambodia many monks, in addition to laity, undergo possession in which they attempt to convert wayward spirits to Buddhism. This, observes Bertrand, “is a complete infraction of the Vinaya, the code of conduct that regulates the life of monks.… Trance is unacceptable for a monk, as it is proof of the absence of serenity and a lack of behavioural control” (p. 163). Thus many of these monks “chose to [temporarily] defrock rather than break the monastic rules” (ibid.). The situation in Cambodia is unique, however. The large number of new mediums there, both lay and monastic, is often interpreted “as the wish of the Buddha to aid mankind and also to pacify and educate all the souls of the dead killed under Pol Pot” (p. 166). The proximity of Buddhist monks to deity or spirit possession is discussed elsewhere as well; cf. DeCaroli 2004:25ff., 128ff.</li>
<li>Yocum 1982:189. It is also important to see the evidence from various first-millennium Tamil sources gathered by Hardy (1983:136–138, passim).</li>
<li>Yocum 1982:188ff. Anyone who has read this far would profit by referring to Yocum’s section on possession (pp. 187–194). On the matter of dating, see Tieken’s revisionist view attributing the Caṇkam poetry to the second half of the first millennium C.E. (2001) and Hart’s strong criticism of this view (2004). Both authors argue their cases well. I am not qualified to say which of the two is right. However, I must offer two observations: (1) the consensus remains that the Caṇkam poetry is of the first half of the first millennium C.E. (2) This is important because it is assumed that much of Indian devotional possession deriving from Sanskrit traditions and sources (e.g., from the traditions based on the Bhāgavata Parāṇa) ultimately derives from Tamil texts and religiosity. Tieken proposes to reverse this. If this were true (and I do not see a definitive solution), then the history of devotional, oracular possession would have to be revised, placing the time of its popularization a half a millennium later and its locus more squarely in Sanskritic rather than Tamil religiosity.</li>
<li>Hardy comments on the female presence in Tamil possession and ecstatic dancing: “Therefore it may not be accidental that in later bhakti religion, where these forms of worship appear again, the psychology of religious awareness is ‘female’” (1983:140).</li>
<li>The south Indian origin of what he rather flatly calls “emotional bhakti” is one of the main themes of Hardy’s Viraha-Bhakti.</li>

<li>Vogt’s psychological interpretations (ibid.:74ff.) are indebted to the work of J. L. Moreno, the founder of “sociometry” and “psychodrama.” Her interpretations are intriguing and often convincing. However, she does not support her otherwise good arguments for application of Moreno’s ideas with reasons why Moreno’s psychodrama is more compelling than Freudian or other allied psychoanalytic theories. Moreno, for better or worse, stands beyond the pale of Freudian and other more medicalized systems that dominate psychological perspectives of scholars in the humanities and that have, partly for this reason, achieved greater subtlety and nuancing than Moreno’s views.</li>

<li>See Walters 2000 for a powerful critique of the uses and misuses of the Pāli vaṃsas by the authors themselves, nationalist Sri Lankans of the nineteenth and twentieth century, and European scholars of the same period.

<li>Scott’s postcolonial positionings are much more sophisticated than Vogt’s. The latter was clearly unfamiliar with Scott’s work.

<li>Macdonald 1975:327n5, for regional variants of this word. Dietrich 1998:259 and passim, records the word dhami as a rural variant.</li>
<li>Viswa Shanti Devi Yajña Committee (2004):15.</li>
<li>Cf. Mumford 1989:148n12; also Aziz 1978:52ff. Mumford labels sngags pas as “magicians” who practice “violent” means of exorcism. In this sense, he may be misrepresenting the teachings and practices of sngags pas themselves, but correctly representing the views of local Tibetan villagers in remote parts of Nepal who, over centuries of direct contact and folklore, have come to see them as such.</li>
<li>See, for example, the Sanskrit manuscripts on possession discussed in Chapter 11.</li>
<li>Although this is correct in its Sanskritic reference, Gellner notes that in Newari the word vaidya refers to “any type of healer who is not directly possessed” (2001:97).</li>
<li>See Carstairs and Kapur 1976.</li>
<li>Brückner 1995:89ff.; Honko 1998:341. Claus is more specific, stating that this is used for a spirit medium (1979:29).</li>
<li>Macdonald 1975:118.</li>
<li>Höfer 1994:18. Macdonald’s designation is also too restrictive for Gellner, who, like Höfer, regards a jhṃkri as a shaman in a more general sense; cf. Gellner 1994:31.</li>
<li>Ibid.; also Merz 1996:347. Hāratī, the “goddess who steals,” is a Hindu-Buddhist crossover deity. She is worshipped by both Hindus and Buddhists, her temple ritual is performed by Newar Buddhist Vajrācāryas, and she is related to other deities of possession, including her husband Unmatta (“Drunken”) Bhairava and several of their children.</li>

<li>Caldwell 1996:223n23. It is of little value to discuss words found in dictionaries without comment or contextualization. Thus it suffices to merely mention that the old standard English and Tamil Dictionary, by Winslow, Spaulding, and Pillai (1888 [1842]), lists the following: under “possession by an evil spirit”–tēvarālan, veṟiyāṭṭu, āvēsam (p. 1019); under “oracle”–āvēsakkāram, tēvarālan, paṭimatton.</li>
<li>Freeman 2001:190.</li>
<li>Inglis 1985:90–91; for a similar list see Diehl 1956:221ff. Inglis studied the similarities between possession dancers and the local manufacture of clay images, both serving as vessels for the divine. We have seen this image of the possessed as a vessel in Tibetan and in Tulu, via Sanskrit. Doubtless it occurs elsewhere in South Asia as well and is a common image elsewhere in the world. For example, Spanish attests vasos preferidos (chosen vessels) and cajitas (little boxes), for those who accept certain spirits for oracular and curative purposes; cf. Kay F. Turner 1992:126.</li>
<li>Lawrence 2003.</li>
<li>Maloney 1980:242.</li>
<li>Ibid.:242ff.; for more on the evil eye in the Maldives, see pp. 258ff. This is not unlike a brujo in Mexico. On the evil eye in Sri Lanka, see Wirz 1954:178f.</li>
<li>On Telugu, see Knipe 2001. He observes that the Telugu word for “possession speech” is vakku (cf. the observation by Lawrence in Sri Lanka) and that “possession ritualists who have one or more neighborhood goddesses ‘come to’ or ‘come on’ them, to employ common Telugu parlance for possession [is] an event also known substantively by the word pūnakam” (p. 344). In a more recent article (2004), Knipe states, importantly, that “Godavari Brahmans are reluctant to mention āveśa, samāveśa, or related experiences, whereas pūnakam, the moment when Ammavāru or a deceased person descends on the occupant of a gaddi [a ‘seat’ for a possession ritualist, shared with the goddess], is eagerly discussed by all ritualists who claim routine divine visitation, as well as by their clients and assembled audiences who share each detail with the village and town folk at large” (p. 440). See also Nuckolls (1991a), who mentions that in Telugu a person on or in whose body a deity comes is called bhaktudù (m) or bhakturàlu (f) (&lt; Skt. bhakta; a devotee). I suspect that these words have broader semantic fields.</li>
<li>However, see the 1961 edition of the Broach (present-day Bharuch) district gazetteer (123ff.). Spirits are referred to as bhūts, as is the case all over northern India, the word for possession is vaḷgan. Spirits are divided into family or household spirits (bharṇābhūt) and outside spirits (baharṇābhūt). If a man remarries after the death of his first wife, it is believed that the spirit of the first wife might possess the second. However, if post-mortem rites are properly performed, the spirit will be pacified. An array of spirits and goddesses of lower-caste Hindus are believed to be responsible for the possession. More fieldwork must be done on possession in Gujarat to fill out this very thin picture.</li>
<li>See, for example, Troisi 1976, which lists more than five hundred studies of this “tribe,” as it is still classified, of Bengal, Orissa, and Bihar, most of them in English, in many of which, doubtless, one can find references to spirit possession.</li>
<li>Nevertheless, I am reminded by William Sax that though “everyone gets possessed, high caste and low, upper caste people tend to deny it of themselves [at least in Garhwal], and attribute it to the subalterns” (personal communication, November 1999). This he attributes to brahmanical image-conjuring rather than suppression, though he does see an effort of Hindu nationalists to suppress possession and other kinds of popular Hinduism. This prurience is little different from that of their detested Victorian predecessors. Pakaslahti has hard evidence to back up Sax’s observations: “Seeking help from Bālājī is not related to illiteracy, low caste status or rural domicile, as the majority of the clientele has average or better than average education, belong to the higher castes and are of urban domicile” (1998:164).</li>
<li>Ramanujan 1986a:69.</li>
<li>Knipe notes that vaidika brahmans in the community he has studied in coastal Andhra Pradesh do “not enter into a heightened state of consciousness after drinking soma.” Yet they are “well aware of the emotional rhetoric of transformation, most dramatically in the large-scale sharing of soma in a śrauta sacrifice such as the vājapeya, pauṇḍarīka, sarvatomukha or the currently rare agniṣṭoma for a newly initiated member of the soma society” (2004:438).</li>
<li>For example, the presence in the Draupadī cult’s Mahābhārata of a Muslim devotee, Muttāl Rāvuttaṉ, who serves Draupadī by accepting blood sacrifices for her and receiving impure offerings, including gāñjā, opium, cigars, and arrack. At one temple, red and green chili peppers are offered to his dog. Cf. Hiltebeitel 1988:101–127. It is difficult to imagine a more non-brahmanical Mahābhārata.</li>
<li>Cf. Prabhu 1977; Honko 1998:389–421; also Knipe 1989. It is important not to commit the error of assuming that because the vocabulary of possession in northern India is in a large number of instances derived from Sanskrit, while in southern India it is less the case, possession in the north is more inclusive of upper classes. North Indian languages are Indo-Aryan while south Indian languages are not, so the idiom of possession in the north would “naturally” be more Sanskritic. Similarly, the presence of a Dravidian vocabulary for possession in the south cannot be used as evidence that the possession is somehow non-brahmanical. Correlation of language with culture is an idea that is dying all too slowly; one would have thought that this would have ceased sixty-five years ago with the publication of Frans Boas’s Race, Language and Culture (1940).</li>
<li>Note the superannuation of the term aṇaṅku in present-day Tamil (or Malayalam) by the concept (and term) śakti.</li>
<li>Cf. Jones 1968. See now Davidson 2002 for a wealth of evidence that tribal practices influenced the development of Mahāyāna Buddhism in the first millennium C.E.</li>
<li>Berglie 1996. This epic is still transmitted largely orally, through bards of virtually every stratum of Tibetan society. No standard edition of the text exists, nor is one likely to be produced anytime soon. Geoffrey Samuel has also done important work on the traditions and shamanic dimensions of the Gesar epic; see Samuel 1991, 1994, 2005.</li>
<li>Ibid.:17.</li>
<li>I agree with Gellner (2001), following Dumont and Pocock, that “it is probably better to talk only of Great Traditions, which certainly exist, and to contrast them with ‘popular religion.’ To call the latter a Little Tradition either appears to imply that it is organized in the same way as the Great Traditions (which it is not) or that it constitutes a pool of survivals of pre-Hindu or pre-textual practices (which is doubtful)” (p. 100). Here I equate “folk” with Gellner’s “popular religion.”</li>
<li>Cf. Rigopoulos 1993:54n18. Rigopoulos reports that a devotee of Sai Baba, possessed by Khaṇḍobā, supplied information on Sai Baba’s personal history (47f., 53f.) (which, unfortunately, Rigopoulos accepts as pramāṇa). Sontheimer (1989a, 1989b, and elsewhere) also supports the folk vs. classical Hinduism dichotomy. But the dichotomy Sontheimer writes about is based only on recent historical and contemporary arrangements.</li>
<li>Cf. Gellner 2001:203. For certain spiritual practices (upāsana) that involve possession of Hanumān, see Śrīmālī n.d.</li>
<li>Gellner writes: “a Maharjan (Farmer) man from a village south of Lalitpur who appeared one day in Kwā Bāhāḥ (an important Buddhist sacred complex) and claimed to be possessed by Kwābāju, i.e. Śākyamuni Buddha, was met with polite but definite scepticism” (2001:211). For a description of a spirit medium who “dances” Śākyamuni Buddha in contemporary Singapore, see DeBernardi 1995:158.</li>
<li>See Holt 2004a, 2004b for Viṣṇu possession in Sri Lanka; and Gellner 1988 [2001:102] on the possession of the king of Nepal: “He was considered to be like Vishnu and to be possessed by him in ritual contexts.”</li>
<li>See also Dietrich 1998:236, for an account of a Nepali healer who claims possession by Brahmā, Viṣṇu, and Śiva, among others.</li>
<li>Not only is the latter apparent from much of the evidence presented in this volume, but one of the primary areas of Indological study in the twentieth century was the determination of Aryan and non-Aryan in early Sanskrit literature. See, for example, Deshpande 1995.</li>
<li>Cf. Hiltebeitel 1991.</li>
<li>Erndl states:
In reading about South Asia, one often gets the impression that possession, along with related ecstatic behavior, belongs to the “little tradition” and is thus largely confined to the lower castes and the poor and uneducated in rural areas. However, in my experience, the phenomenon of possession in the cult of Śerāṇvālī is widespread throughout the population. I have witnessed Goddess possession in both village and urban settings, among low and high castes (including Brahmins), the poor and the rich, the uneducated and the educated, Sikhs as well as Hindus. (1996:179)</li>
<li>Bell argues that ritualization is not a “standardized process” of traditionalization, but that:
[r]itual can be a strategic way to “traditionalize,” that is, to construct a type of tradition, but in so doing it can also challenge and renegotiate the very basis of tradition to the point of upending much of what has been seen as fixed previously or by other groups. Examples abound, ranging from the ascetic internalization of the Vedic sacrifice and the iconoclasm of early Ch’an Buddhism to the Reformation’s challenge to papal authority through a recreation of the free outpouring of the spirit to the early church. (1992:124)</li>
<li>For an accessible general discussion of this, see Bryant 2001, ch. 5. As I write this in Iowa, I am surrounded by the states of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, Missouri, South Dakota and Nebraska, while the best-known place names in the region are those of the Mississippi River and the city of Chicago. All of these are Native American names, the total number of which by now surely exceeds the number of Native Americans in these areas who have any knowledge of their ancestral languages. Although an extreme example, it is nevertheless not wholly dissimilar to the results found elsewhere of linguistic and cultural contact.</li>
<li>Mayaram 2000.</li>
<li>See F. Smith 1987:59–63, 121–223.</li>
<li>See Pollock 1990.</li>
<li>Dirks 1992:231. Possession within epic or other narrativized ritual performance in south India yields rather similar results; cf. Hiltebeitel, Brückner, Biardeau, Caldwell, Freeman, and others.</li>
<li>Zvelebil 1981:82. See also Stewart 1995:574ff. for a modern story of a faked devotional possession during the life of Haridāsa, a devotee of Śrī Caitanya in the early sixteenth century.</li>
<li>Yocum 1982:144. There is earlier testimony for this in the Mahābhārata tale of Aśvatthāman, discussed in Chapter 6.</li>
