title = "10 Exorcists, Oracles, and Healers"

+++
In spite of the efforts of Meyer, Erndl, Bhattacharyya, Stanley, McDaniel, Srinivas, Freeman, Claus, Brückner, Macdonald, Pakaslahti, Gellner, Vogt, Wadley, Caldwell, Inglis, Wirz, and a few others to highlight the importance of local terminology, many ethnographers fail to provide not only the vocabulary for possession but also the specialized words or terms for the person possessed. Let us now briefly look at some of the vocabulary in Hindi, Urdu, Gujarati, Bengali, Marathi, Nepali, Tulu, Tamil, Malayalam, Simhala, and the language of the Maldive islands.

Wadley states: “In North India, the native terms for oracle are baki and bhagat. The native terms for exorcist include jhāḍṇewālā, ojhā, mantravidh [sic: should be mantravid], and mativah.”181 Wadley does not provide translations. They are: baki (babbler); bhagat (devotee); jhāḍnevālā (spiritualist); ojhā (exorcist, folk healer); mantravid (well-versed in mantras); and mativah (desire-bearer; opinion-bearer).182 Henry and Lambert distinguish between Tantric healers called sidh or sayana and mediums, bhopa or ojhā.183 Fuchs records that in central India the barwa cures by exorcism, while a janka does so by divinization.184 McClintock, in Pakistani Panjab, cites the Urdu āmil, more properly “agent” or “operator,” as “exorcist,” distinguishing it from the jādugar (magician) and pīr (saint).185 In Gujarati, according to the Broach District gazetteer, the term bhagat is mentioned as someone who is able to diagnose the provenance of a spirit, while a bhuva, who may be from any caste or religious community, is an exorcist.186 This is also a common term in Marathi, along with jhāḍ (medium).187 Bhattacharyya provides three words for folk healer in Bengali, all (seemingly) synonymous: ōjhā (Skt. upādhyāya), rojā, and guṇina.188 As noted above, Sontheimer records the Marathi devṛṣī, locally denoting a shaman, healer, and possession oracle. Sax notes the terms dañgārīya (little horsie) and paśvā (animal), for a person who is regularly possessed by a local deity.189 With respect to the latter, a relatively modern Tantric text, the Āgamarahasyam, also employs this image. In its description of śavasādhana, the practice (sādhana) of meditating while sitting on a corpse (śava) and in a cremation ground (śmaśāna), this text states that one should sit on the corpse as if riding a horse (aśvārohaṇam).190 Although this is not possession per se, the image is applied to a situation in which possession of the corpse by the deity is implicit.

As mentioned, the primary terms in Nepali for a religious healer are jhṃkri and paju, who can be either spirit mediums or practitioners of other shamanic arts,191 and the related jaki in Assamese.192 A primary Tibetan term for Vajrayāna yogis and ritualists who practice exorcism, sometimes applying wrathful means, is sngags-pa (nag-pa) (mantraist).193 They closely observe the vows of the Vajrayāna, which include observance of the bodhisattva vows, and require particular qualifications to be met for a practitioner applying “wrathful means.” The term, if not the qualifications, is similar to the Sanskrit māntrika, denoting an exorcist in relatively recent texts,194 as well as to the mantravādin, a category of ritual specialist noted in south India who employs therapeutic mantras and is distinguished locally from a vaid or vaidya, a doctor of āyurveda,195 and a pātrī (Skt. for “vessel”), a healer who diagnoses and cures through possession.196 Thus Brückner and Honko report that in Tulu pātri is used for a possessed person.197 Macdonald states that a jhṃkri is one who “after having first of all suffered possession by a spirit foreign to his everyday world, manages to control it and regulate it.”198 The jhṃkri appears to be a figure who moves from peripheral to central possession, in keeping with Lewis’s observations. The foreign spirit resides at the periphery of the social and mythic worlds of the jhṃkri, but is then domesticated and employed to present a possession that is central, if marginally intrusive, in the local cultus. Höfer prefers a more straightforward description of the jhṃkri than Macdonald’s “interpreter of the world.” Höfer states: “Roughly defined, the jhṃkri is a ‘shaman,’ i.e., a socially recognized ritual specialist whose main task is curing the sick; he is claimed to be capable of controlling and/or producing paranormal experience—visions, possession, etc.—allowing for a privileged, direct contact with occult forces and beings.”199 Gellner distinguishes the jhṃkri from the mediums recognized by the Newari as dyah-mā (godmother)200 or the more inclusive category dyāḥ waipĩ. About the latter, Gellner notes that they diagnose illness and other social problems and more often than not are low-caste women who suggest treatment in the form of the worship of certain deities.201

The nearly identical terms dyaḥ waimha in Newari and devatā āune in Nepali indicate “one to whom the gods come.”202 Also used for possession are the Newari verbs waye (to come) and dubiye (to enter into).203 Gellner also places the healers and mediums at the nexus of classical and folk Tantra and Vajrayāna Buddhism, in which the recitation of certain sūtra texts are used for apotropaic and protective purposes and in which Buddhist mantras are merged and jumbled by possessed healers with jhārphuk, exorcistic practices of “brushing and blowing.”204 As noted, the term for the healer subject to possession in Höfer’s study of Tamang shamanism in Nepal is bombo, one who treats individuals but has no role in communal rituals. The Tamang themselves regard this as a synonym of jhṃkri.205 Gaborieau records the Indo-Aryan word dhāmī and the non-IA ḍāṃgre in central Nepal.206 Berglie provides a detailed description of the training of a spirit-medium: the recruiting, apprenticeship, testing, acquisition of ritual paraphernalia, and an account of the trance experiences of the Tibetan dpaḥ-bo.207 Dietrich provides interesting vignettes of Buddhist, Hindu, and Muslim healers, Newari and Nepali, urban and rural in Nepal.208 Her study is consistent with earlier ones, though hers is more squarely situated in the indigenous healing traditions. Both Hindu and Buddhist spirit healers occasionally attribute possession among their clients to negative astrological influences, something I suspect is more widespread through the Indian subcontinent than ethnographers have recorded.

Anwarul Karim, a folklorist who studied shamanism in his native Bangladesh, is careful to clarify his terms. He explains that the Muslim ojhā belongs to the larger faqīr community of Sufis and are exorcists as well as healers of snakebite, female hysteria, childhood ailments, and cattle diseases. They are contrasted with the Hindu ojhā, who belongs to low-caste and peasant communities and are often ojhā by hereditary occupation.209 Karim distinguishes these practitioners from the kabirāj, a practitioner of normative Hindu medicine (he does not use the word Āyurveda, but this is probably intended).210 The faqīr invokes spirits or jinns to cure diseases, while the ojhā, either Muslim or Hindu, arrange and sing religious songs known as bhasan, padmapurāṇ or behulā laksmindar, which invoke the serpent deity Mānashā (as in the debaddhani festival in Assam) as well as other deities, both male and female, for healing.211 Shukla noted the words sokhā (one who absorbs or dries up) and guṇī (adept), in addition to ojhā and bhagat. He also noted that Muslim exorcists are called maulvī (a scholar of Islamic law), fakīr (a Muslim mendicant or saint), and namājī (a devout Muslim).212

Caldwell and Freeman inform us that, in Malayalam, the words for oracle are veḷicchapāṭu or kõmaram. Most are male priests associated with temples. However, some are females who reside in the hilly tribal areas near Palghat. Caldwell suspects that the male veḷicchapāṭu “in fact modeled their behavior on these female shamans, whose role was superseded in the Aryanized lowlands.”213 Freeman remarks that, regardless of their origins, “[t]hese priests are selected by a combination of a specific lineage eligibility, divine selection through spontaneous acts of possession, and subsequent ratification by astrological or other kinds of oracular readings.”214 Inglis notes the distinction in Tamilnadu between the cāmiyāṭi (god dancer) as the name for both the institution of nonshamanic oracular possession and its performers in the Madurai area, nērttikam (< Skt. nṛtya, [dance]; nārttikam [dancer]) (individuals who become possessed in the course of carrying out personal vow fulfillment) and kōṭaṅki (“possession specialists … who ply the trade of soothsaying in a market or other public place for a fee”).215 In Sri Lankan Tamil, Lawrence cites the word kaṭṭātikal for “oracle” and teyvam āṭukākkal for deity-dancer, as well as vākku solluṟatu for “uttering oracle” (discussed above).216

Finally, Clarence Maloney discusses fanḍita in the Maldive islands, which is “magic or religious ‘science’ of any sort, white or black, curative or preventative, fertility ritual or divination.”217 The word fanḍita, from Sanskrit paṇḍita, probably entered Divehi, the local language, through an earlier Tamil-Malayalam substrate population. In spite of an extensive catalogue of spirits, spirit possession is comparatively rare in the Maldives. This relative absence may be an influence of Islam on a local tradition that is still extensively practiced. Nevertheless, in Divehi a conjurer, exorcist, herbalist, astrologer, and protector of the evil eye (esfinna < Sinhala a svaha) is called a “fanḍita man.”218

As mentioned above, this review, lengthy though it may be, is not intended to be complete or definitive. I have made little effort to obtain data on possession for Telugu,219 Oriya, Assamese, and other northeastern languages and dialects and have not exerted much more effort for Gujarati.220 Scouring the district gazetteers, as I did in part for Gujarat, Kerala, and Maharashtra, will supply greater breadth, but I am not certain that our depiction of possession in South Asia will assume much greater depth for the effort. Nor are the data available in early highly positivistic studies of tribal areas likely to deepen our knowledge of possession on the subcontinent. I cannot make it my project here to take on the vast early (pre-1960) ethnographic literature, which, in any case, is hardly anthropological in the contemporary sense.221 However, I hope that what I have accumulated helps illustrate some of the conceptual, lexical, and semantic patterns of the language of possession as they emerge from a background in Sanskritic and other classical Indian possession as well as ways in which it may be independent of that background. These include the expression of possession as salvific, purificatory, exorcistic, therapeutic, celebratory, oracular, aesthetically potent, and socially binding—in part because it cuts across caste, class, and gender boundaries practically everywhere in South Asia.
