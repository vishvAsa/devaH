1. Hiltebeitel (2001:18ff.) argues for a much more consolidated dating, with the entire composition between 150 B.C.E. and the beginning of the Common Era. See Fitzgerald’s critique of this (2003).
2. It will not be possible here to deal with cases not involved directly with possession, no matter how fascinating, such as the case of the mixed-gender identity of Sikhandin, in the Vanaparvan.
3. Cf. Olivelle 1998:375; Roebuck 2000:312.
4. The literature on regional MBhs and Rāms attests to this; cf. Raghavan 1980, Richman 1991.
5. Cf. Amaruśataka: premāveśita (37), premāveśa (43), also Kādambarī 357:3; see Daśakumāracarita for madanāveśa (48:7), also Kādambarī 271.4, 280.7; in addition, KSS shows smarāveśavivaśa (37.205), ārūḍhasmarāveśa (65.230), smarāviṣṭa (81.55), and smarajvarāveśavivaśa (119.156). Interestingly, the only occurrence in the Kāmasūtra is for anger: iti krodhād ivāviṣṭã kalahāṃ prayojayet (2.5.38c).
6. Saundarānanda 14.31: nidrām nāveṣṭum arhasi.
7. Hará 1979a renders this “sleeplessness.”
8. Lajjāsamāviṣṭa in Harivaṃśa (Citraśālā Press) 3.115.39.
9. For most of these words Hara supplies multiple references, though here one suffices. All references are from the MBA unless otherwise stated: adharma (12.251.17), ahaṃkāra (13.102.10), alakṣmī (3.33.39), anartha (12.171.23), asukha (11.25.11), asura (3.240.11), avamāna (3.246.20), avṛṣṭi/ativṛṣṭi (12.91.35, ārti (6.15.4), bhaga (3.163.35), bhī (3.168.16), cintā (Harivaṃśa 109.23), darpa (1.189.17), dānava (3.240.13), duḥkha (4.18.8), durbhikṣa (12.68.29), dainya (12.149.105), ghṛnā (3.36.18), harṣa (3.162.10), hrī (9.62.54), jvara (12.27.12), kali (3.56.3), kaśmala (7.144.7), kāma (1.204.15), kautūhula (3.20.75), kopa (3.11.30), krodha (12.249.5), kṛpā (5.180.36), kṣudh (14.57.19), lobha (12.170.14), mada (16.4.31), manmatha (Rām 4.65.15), manyu (1.204.17), māna (12.253.38), mātsarya (12.12.29), moha (7.31.32), mṛtyu (12.149.41), nidrā (Rām 4.26.7), pāpman (12.17.2), pauruṣa (9.10.24), pipāsā (13.70.6), prajagara (7.56.7), rajas (12.329.29.2), rāga (14.42.51), rākṣasa (3.240.33), roṣa (3.21.18), ruṣ(ā) (9.25.25), sambhrama (1.73.25), sattva (6.40.10), śoka (3.2.15), śrama (13.70.6), tamas (4.55.24), tuṣṭi (1.187.5), vepathu (5.85.13), vismaya (3.289.23), viṣṇu (3.195.12, cf. 12.159.130), vyādhi (12.91.34), yakṣa (3.219.51), yakṣman (12.329,46.25). It should be noted that in this survey I am leaving out hundreds of references to pra√viś in its usual sense of “entrance.” On the differences between krodha and manyu, see Hara 2001.

19. 13.40.56ab: netrābhyāṃ netrayor asyā raśmīn saṃyojya raśmibhiḥ. This is consistent with the theory of apperception in Nyāya and Vaiśesika that sight is made possible by rays emanating from the eye and traveling to the object, thus grasping it.
20. 13.40.57: lakṣaṇaṃ lakṣaṇenaiva vadanaṃ vadancna ca | aviceṣṭann atiṣṭhad vai chāyevāntargato muniḥ ||
21. 13.40.58d: sā tam abudhyata ||
22. 13.41.3cd: niśceṣṭaṃ stabdhanayanaṃ yathālekhyagataṃ tathā ||
23. 13.41.14d: vāṇi saṃskārabhūṣitā ||
24. On this story, see Bloomfield 1917:7–8. The dimensions of possession that I am addressing here are at odds with Bloomfield’s more conventional reckoning, that in the MBh “[t]here is but one elaborate instance of the art of pervading another’s body with one’s mind-stuff” (p. 7). See also White 2004 for another evaluation of paraśarīrapraveśa in the MBh. This article came to my attention too late to take full advantage of it.
25. I agree with Rocher (1986) that assigning exact dates to these Purāṇas is risky.
26. Liṅga Purāṇa (LiP) 1.24.128, cited by Hara 1979a:272.
27. LiP 1.24.130.
28. This concept of partial incarnation, aṃśāvatāra, was exploited by Vaiṣṇavas in the early second millennium C.E.; cf. Chapter 9.
29. 12.59.130ab: tapasā bhagavān viṣṇur āviveśa ca bhūmipān|. Fitzgerald translates: “Through the power of his inner heat, the blessed Viṣṇu entered into the king” (2004:311).
30. Hara cites a similar verse, supposedly also from the LiP (1.170.25[?], which, however, I am unable to find in the published edition): kūrmarūpam ahaṃ kṛtvā uddhareyaṃ mahīm imām | jalakrīḍānusadṛśaṃ vārāhaṃ rūpam āviśat ||. This describes Viṣṇu’s descent (avatāra) as a tortoise (kūrma) and a boar (varāha) in language typical of the idiom of avatāra in the Purāṇas. The change of voice is somewhat inexplicable; but the latter at least is phrased in terms of Viṣṇu possessing (āviśat) the form of a boar.
31. MBh 1.61.66ab; cf. MBh 10.7.64–65 in the discussion below of Aśvatthāman’s possession of Śiva in the Sauptikaparvan.
32. Shulman 1994:27.
33. Cf. Granoff 1998a:177ff.
34. Morris 2000:100.
35. Cf. LiP 70.43–8, in which ether and sound penetrate the element of touch, vāyu contains both sound and touch, etc.
36. Handelman and Shulman 1997:111.
37. 1.166.27cd: apy enaṃ naramāṃsena bhojayeti punaḥ punaḥ ||
38. My translations are adapted from van Buitenen 1973:333–335.
39. This ferocity in which embattled warriors entered states of possession and were said to alter their appearances was not limited to India or the MBh, but may be seen elsewhere in the Indo-European world. See Cahill 1995:82–84, for an account from the twelfth-century Irish prose epic “Tain Bo Cuailnge, the Cattle Raid of Cooley.” This account has a striking resemblance to the MBh (though I am not suggesting any kind of direct influence). The Irish referred to their possession and shape-shifting as “warp-spasm.” Cahill writes: “The Romans, in their first encounters with these exposed, insane warriors, were shocked and frightened. Not only were the men naked, they were howling and, it seemed, possessed by demons, so outrageous were their strength and verve. Urged by the infernal skirl of pipers, they presented to the unaccustomed and throbbing Roman sensorium a multimedia event featuring all the terrors of hell itself” (pp. 82–83). Cahill’s translation of the passage from the “Tain” is well worth consulting.
40. MBh 3.240.11-34; trans. van Buitenen 1975:692–693.
41. Cf. the note on this verse in Johnson 1998:105.
42. On Aśvatthāman’s experience as epiphany, see Laine 1989:122ff., 149ff.
43. Cf. Johnson 1998:40.
44. Ibid.:xxi; John D. Smith 1980:70.
45. dharmc cārthe ca kāme ca mokṣe ca bharatarṣabha | yad ihāsti tad anyatra yan nehāsti na tat kvacit || (1.56.33).
46. anāśrityaitad ākhyānaṃ kathā bhuvi na vidyate | (1.2.240ab).
47. Wujastyk 1998:219ff.
48. See MBh 9.44–46 for a vivid and detailed description of Skanda’s spirit warriors.
49. See Mann 2003:15–119, which is now the most complete and scholarly account of the birth of Skanda in the MBh; also Mann 2005.
50. The Śivasahasranāma, in the Anuśāsanaparvan, gives Āveśa as a name of Śiva: āvedanīya āveśaḥ sarvagandhasukhāvahaḥ (MBh 13.17.115ab).
51. 3.219.24–25; trans. by van Buitenen 1975:658.
52. For a more “medically” detailed account, see a section from the Kaśyapasaṃhitā translated by Wujastyk (1998:212–230). Also very important is White 2003:35ff., which locates the balāgrahas of the MBh in the art and culture of the Kuṣāṇas. White provides a number of cognate passages in the Purāṇas and in temple architecture, and in his effort to historicize these “seizers,” provides a number of epidemiological explanations. For example, he interprets Pūtanā, “Stinky,” with the pustulant sores of chicken pox, Śītapūtanā, “Cool Stinky,” as evocative of the later smallpox goddess Śītalā, and Saramā, the mother of dogs in the ṚV, Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa, and elsewhere as carriers of epilepsy, because mad dogs, like epileptics, can foam at the mouth (pp. 51ff). Also relevant are White’s comments on the avian nature of many of these seizers, which he reads semiotically as fearful bearers of contagious diseases and carrion-eaters (pp. 43 [with a figure of a Nepalese bird-headed grāhī of the late fifteenth century], 58).
53. See Snellgrove 1987:134 and Staal 1990b:288ff., for a review of different views of the problem.
54. See Pollock’s insightful comments on this issue (1993b:282f.), where he describes the “othering” that characterizes the Rāmāyaṇa, quite distinct from the MBh.
55. See the discussion by Sutherland and Goldman 1996:65–70. On the rākṣasas of Laṅka, they write, “although theirs is largely a brutalized world given over to the indulgence of the senses, there are numerous indications in the book that the city also possesses a life of art and even of religion” (p. 65). See also Pollock’s discussion (1991:68–84).
56. See the excellent discussion on these two by Sutherland and Goldman 1996:39–62.
57. This is a theme Pollock develops in 1993b.
58. Ramanujan 1991:44ff.
59. 1991:199. Lutgendorf notes, however, that “[i]t is clear that most expounders do not enter into a state of actual ‘possession’—indeed, their performances are characterized by a high degree of lucidity and control—yet we must note that the relationship between possession and folk performance is a complex one and even in kathã, … the line demarcating the two is not always clear” (1991:184). This supports Ramanujan’s observations cited above.
60. I have seen images of Prahlāda, son of the demon king Hiraṇyakaśipu and an ardent devotee of Viṣṇu, placed on a few altars at Bālājī, and I expect that worship of him may be seen elsewhere. But this is on an extremely limited scale compared to worship of Hanumān.
61. See Alter 1992:198ff.
62. Cf. Lutgendorf 1997:320.
63. For example, “rage possessed Rāvaṇa” (rāvaṇaṃ manyur āviśat, 6.62.33d); “anger could no longer possess him” (krodho nānatram āviŜat, 1.64.3).
64. “Hearing of her arrival, who had lived so long in the home of a rākṣasa, Rāghava was overcome [āviśat] with the triad of delight, anger, and pity” (6.102.16).
65. “Overwhelmed by brahman killing” (brahmahatyā yadāviśat, 1.23.18).
66. “Heartache over the exile of Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa once more swept over [āviveśa] him, the equal of Vāsava, as the demon’s darkness sweeps over the sun” (2.57.2), trans. Pollock 1991:204.
67. “But then we began to experience intense sweating, fatigue, and fear. And we were seized by confusion [samāviśata mohaḥ], which soon gave way to a dreadful stupor” (4.60.10), trans. Lefeber 1994:182.
68. “Then Rāma’s consternation gave way to a feeling of fear that shot through [āviveśa] him with sharp pangs” (3.42.20, trans. Pollock 1991:176). “Having seen the bodies and all the limbs of Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa in a heap, covered with arrows, fear overwhelmed [āviśat] Sugrīva” (6.36.24). “Seeing Rāma completely enraged, all beings became fearful of a rising tide of dread, and Rāvaṇa was overcome [āviśat] with fear” (6.91.4).
69. “Tell me once again, monkey, of the characteristic marks of Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa so that sorrow shall not overwhelm [samāviśet] me” (5.33.3), trans. Goldman and Sutherland 1996:201. “Grief overcame [samāviśat] Sītā, anxious, looking [for Lakṣmaṇa]” (7.47.17d).
70. This is exceptional in the Rām, where pra√viś is employed almost entirely to indicate simple entrance; cf. 1.66.3, 1.67.1, 76.7; 2.1.5, 9.3, 62.12, 65.22; 3.1.1, 11.15,16, 52.11; 5.16.9; 6.22.6; 7.51.5, 65.3, 73.2, 93.6,7. In one instance ā√viś indicates uncomplicated entrance: 7.14.21d, toraṇām tat samāviśat, “Rāvaṇa entered the gateway,” parallels pra√viś in the next verse, 7.14.22.
71. “The brothers were absorbed [samāviśan] in the precepts of dharma proper to each of them” (7.10.2cd).
72. “It had javelins and iron cudgels arrayed in rows” (yathākramāveśitaśaktitomaram, 5.45.5d); trans. Goldman and Goldman 1996:238.
73. “When Lakṣmaṇa and Sītā had entered [praviṣṭe] the cave, Rāma said to himself, ‘Good, it is all arranged,’ and then he donned [āviśat] his armor” (3.23.14), trans. Pollock 1991:137.
74. “collapsed to the ground” (dharaṇyāṃ samupāviśat, 5.32.11); trans. Goldman and Goldman 1996:198.
75. “Then Rama lay down [samāviśad] with Sītā upon the pallet” (2.81.20), trans. Pollock 1991:252. “Nor would sleep come [āviveśa] to him when he had gone to bed at night” (4.26.7).
76. “Since I was exhausted, I once more sat on your lap as you sat [āviśam] there” (5.36.20), trans. Goldman and Goldman 1996:217.
77. 1.70.14: “leaving Kuśadhvaja in my care” (kuśadhvajaṃ samāveśya bhāraṃ mayi); 1.41.3: “turning the kingdom over to Dilīpa” (tasmin rājyaṃ samāveśya dilīpe).
78. 1.42.19cd: “They became reabsorbed into the ākāśa and were restored to their own realms” (punar ākāsam āviśya syāṃl lokān pratipedire ||); cf. also 3.50.29, 5.1.181, 6.31.62, 40.59, 45.33, 57.45. Not unrelated is 3.50.22: “like a streak of lightning caught [āviśya] within a storm cloud” (trans. Pollock 1991:196). Also: “If you fly about [āviśasi] in the three worlds, taking the form of a quick-witted bird” (6.130.60).
79. 2.87.17: ctaṃ āviśataḥ śailaṃ; 7.14.3: kailāśaṃ girim āviśat.
80. 2.38.6: vanaṃ āviíate nūnaṃ sabhāryaḥ sahalakṣmaṇaḥ |
81. MBh 11.19.16, Viviṃśati absorbed (āviśa) in sleep; Rām 3.52.12, occupying (āviśat) the women’s quarters of the palace; Rām 4.19.15, monkeys possessing (āviśya) citadels; Rām 7.58.1, Śatrughna occupying (samāviśet) the arbor (parṇaśālā) at night.
82. 2.30.10, trans. Pollock 1991:146 and note, p. 382, explaining that he adopts the readings of the Northern Recension sattvenāviṣṭa (hence the necessity for the ace. daśaratham) and that sattva here is essence as spirit.
83. Gombrich 1988:37.
