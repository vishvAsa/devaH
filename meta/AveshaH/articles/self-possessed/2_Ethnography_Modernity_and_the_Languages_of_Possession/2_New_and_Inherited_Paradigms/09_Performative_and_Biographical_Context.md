A major feature of possession known from ethnographic literature is its frequent occurrence in either religious drama or religious ritual (or both together). One need look no further than the recent work of Alf Hiltebeitel and Richard Frasca on South Indian street theater,185 Kathleen Erndl’s work on goddess worship in Panjab,186 and William Sax’s work on the Pāṇḍav Līlā in Garhwal to recognize the prominence of possession in contemporary religious drama.187 In the Pāṇḍav Līlā, for example, the actors or dancers are regarded as possessed by the characters whom they represent, such as Arjuna, Kṛṣṇa, or Draupadī. Indeed, as in the Kṛṣṇa and Rām līlās in Vrindaban, Varanasi, and elsewhere, the deities are themselves believed to be physically present, temporarily but fully manifested in the performers. This display of power and presence of the sacred permits the deities to be worshipped directly. Also documented is possession judged as higher and lower, positive and negative, not at all unlike the general distinction noted above between ā√viś and pra√viś in “Sanskritic possession.”

Schoembucher recognizes similar categorical pairs in the anthropological record: “controlled and uncontrolled possession, induced and spontaneous possession, … desired and undesired, divine and demonic possession.”188 As an example of this, Hiltebeitel writes, “In Draupadī cult contexts, drunkenness and narcotics are thought of as inducing a kind of impure, or ‘polluted’ possession, one which is essentially demonic and stands in opposition to higher forms of possession which become vehicles for bhakti.”189 A feature of possession common to many of the ethnographies is play. The tendency toward the ludic in South Asian religion is strong,190 and Erndl shows in her book that the goddess “plays” with her devotees in the form of pavan (wind), while Wadley and Sax show that the possessing spirits or deities enjoy “dancing” in the bodies of their temporary hosts. On possession and play, Tom Driver writes,

Possession, in my view, has also to be regarded as a kind of serious game.… [T]he seriousness and the truthfulness of spirit possession does not mean that it involves no role-playing, as is made obvious by the fact that costumes and props are made ready ahead of time, prepared for a panoply of spirits that is just as recognizable as the dramatis personae of any familiar script.… In spirit possession, “playing for keeps” is escalated to a very high level.191

Another feature, noted by Sax, is “oracular possession,” a phenomenon discussed below. Sax writes:

(1) that such possession often, but not always, runs in families, usually from male to male; (2) that according to popular stereotypes, the oracle has no choice in the matter, and also cannot remember any details of his (or very rarely, her) trances; and (3) that discussions I have had with friends who are regularly possessed lead me to suspect that in many cases the oracle experiences an intrusion from outside of another consciousness or being but also adds his own elements of manipulation and self-conscious stagecraft in order to achieve a convincing performance.192

Susan Wadley writes succinctly in a slightly different vein, in order to distinguish between an oracle and an exorcist: “Basically, an oracle is possessed by a spirit and speaks while possessed; the exorcist himself is not possessed and therefore is not an oracle.”193 About the latter there can be no disagreement; but the label “oracle” for anyone who speaks while possessed is much too broad and certainly inexact for the material we consider. A. W. Macdonald also contributes to conceptually locating oracular possession. In describing why he so delicately translates the Nepali word jhkri (var. jhāṃkri), a magicoreligious specialist often regarded more broadly as a shaman, as “interpreter of the world,” Macdonald provides an excellent description of spirit mediumship in South Asia. “Interpreter of the world,” says Macdonald,

avoids the pejorative connotation “conjurer” or “wizard.” These latter terms are generally associated with irregular activities that either stray slightly from the societal norms or that are blatantly anti-social. The jhkri, however, appears to be the very vehicle of a certain Nepali traditionalism. He is a person who falls into a trance, during which time voices speak through his person, thereby enabling him to diagnose illnesses and sometimes cure them, give advice for the future and clarify present events in terms of their relationship to the past. He is therefore both a privileged intermediary between spirits (who cause and cure illness) and men; between the past, present and future; between life and death, and most importantly between the individual and a certain social mythology.194

Another form of ethnography is the religious or spiritual biography in which possession is explained for the edification of an audience or student as a reproduceable benchmark experience.195 In a contemporary report of a Tantrie practitioner known as the Aghori Vimalananda, written by Robert Svoboda, the Aghori disregards the word “possession” as well as the common Indic terminology discussed here, and speaks instead of avishkara (Skt. āviṣkāra; manifestation, sudden appearance), which he equates with the Hindi baithak (baiṭhak; seat) and the Urdu hazri (hājiri; presence).196 He employs these terms to denote a state in which a deity is invited into the body of the tantric practitioner, to his or her benefit.197 Vimalananda tells Svoboda, “By long worship your subtle body will actually take the form of the deity you are worshipping.”198 In addition to this practice, in which a full manifestation of a deity is produced through spiritual practice, “[t]he deity can enter into someone’s body, and you can worship Him or Her in that way.”199
