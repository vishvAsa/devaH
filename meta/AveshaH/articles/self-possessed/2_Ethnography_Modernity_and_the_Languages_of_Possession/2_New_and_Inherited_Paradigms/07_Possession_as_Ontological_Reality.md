title = "07 Possession as Ontological Reality"

+++
Possession is understood as ontological or veridical reality by those who undergo the experience, which is to say as imposition or investiture on an individual personality of an independent and unseen external agent. This, of course, is the emic view, the narrative of indigenous tradition, the interpretation given to possession by the groups or individuals studied. This stands opposed to nearly all academic theorizing—to the emic narrative of scholarship. Nevertheless, it is an interpretation not wholly discarded by many ethnographers and others engaged in the issue. For most scholars who recognize, if grudgingly, the possibility of possession, this recognition is tactical, as a contribution to other theoretical agendas. The underlying assumptions of the social constructivist approaches that characterize most academic theorizing about possession—that issues and ambiguities concerning power and authority lie at the basis of much spirit belief and nearly all claims of unmediated possession experience—are being increasingly softened by scholars willing to find a way for their approaches to reconcile with indigenous notions that they find are all too often summarily dismissed. These scholars, most of whom occupy university positions in religion, psychology, and anthropology, are themselves, perhaps, rebelling against the possession–or, to put it more mildly, the enchantment–of their disciplines by modernity (or postmodernity). To transpose Geertz’s observation of cultures as possessing a “curious mixture of borrowed fragments of modernity and exhausted relics of tradition,” we might speak of contemporary academics sorting out for itself exhausted relics of modernity and borrowed fragments of tradition.143

Perhaps the most sympathetic and best-reasoned considerations of this mixed viewpoint are by Felicitas Goodman, whose work has been (perhaps not unsurprisingly) largely overlooked in the past decade or so,144 Edith Turner,145 and Michael Cuneo.146 In 1970, the Indian psychoanalytic literature added the category of “possession disorder” to its list of diagnostic categories, in recognition of the dissimilarities of alternative identity adoption in the possession experience from other types of dissociative disorders.147 This is part of a growing trend (at least in South Asia) to consider possession a viable category in anthropological and psychological theorizing, in which interpretative frameworks supplement one another or overlap.

Boddy notes, “Possession intersects with numerous cultural domains including medicine and religion, but is itself reducible to none.”148 For example, psychological or social factors may be causal in ritually circumscribed, though socially or politically empowering, experiences of possession, experiences that may be characterized by temporary loss of personal control—which under “ordinary” circumstances would be strikingly disempowering. That is, one may take seriously the givenness of spirits in order to understand possession as an idiom of communication, moral discourse, gender, identity formation, and conflictual or power relations.149 A good example of this is Manuel Moreno’s study of possession in Tamilnadu, in which he questions analyses of Hindu gods as “‘disembodied symbols’ of social realities and human relationships.”150 Rather, he argues, gods and humans “are related by complementary, mutually rewarding bodily exchanges,” which, as shown below, is not far from the notion of transfer of essence that characterizes possession in India as early as the Upaniṣads. Notwithstanding a few attempts at multivalent theorizing such as Moreno’s, academic approaches to possession have usually foregrounded the social or psychosocial contexts of possession, or the moral or communicative value of its performance, approaches that generally, it seems, have drained possession of the assumption of existential reality. More to the point, to most academics the existential possibility of possession is epiphenomenal to constructed psychosocial or moral realities, while in the present study the opposite is the case: Because of the relative absence of thick description of possession in the classical literature of India, environmental factors are often forced into the position of epiphenomena. This is why Halperin advises treading a fine line between the usual scholastic etic approaches and an unqualified “emic friendly” approach.

Given the veritable minefield of official discourses, underlying assumptions, deeply held feelings, and occasionally conflicting behaviors of participants, the ethnographer is perhaps best advised to do research equipped with a flexible analytical armamentarium. Preferably, this approach includes a more than superficial appreciation of other emic worldview(s), without being limited to such an orientation.151

The present work should, it is hoped, permit a flexible armamentarium to enter, to possess, its analysis.
