In Bengali, √bharā (to fill) is attested in the sense of possession, in addition to its expected etymological usage.49 The nominal form bhar means “weight,” hence the two meanings conflate: being filled with or bearing the weight of a spirit or deity. The extended sense of possession as intense emotional engagement is also found in Bengali: for example, karuṇā-bharala (filled with [i.e., immersed in] compassion).50

Deborah Bhattacharyya, based in Bengal, examines possession and other behavior that “specifically refers to the collapse of the boundaries between the inside and outside of the individual”51 and are treatable through folk psychiatry. She describes three paradigms of “madness” (pāgalāmi): (1) bhūt bharā (ghost possession); (2) tuk or tuktāka (black magic or sorcery); and (3) māthār golmāl (malfunctioning of the head). The most common terms she found for possession are, in addition to bhūt bharā, bhūte pāoẏā (the getting or receiving of a ghost) and the Sanskritism apadṛṣṭi (inauspicious glance, evil eye),52 which compares to the attested Sanskrit term dṛṣṭipātam.53 Although the term apadṛṣṭi is found in Bengali literature (for example, by Tagore),54 I am unable to find it used with this particular meaning in any Sanskrit text. More common in spoken Bengali for “evil eye” is bad naẓar, borrowed from Urdu.55 I suspect that apadṛṣṭi and other Sanskrit words used more frequently in modern Indo-Aryan than in Sanskrit, such as ārūḍha for possession in Sri Lanka (but unlike āveśa, which is used commonly in both Sanskrit and modern vernacular languages), are the products of local traditions of applied Sanskrit that grew up alongside the literature but are not fully reflected within it; in other words, they were clever attempts to Sanskritize the vernaculars.56 While it is reasonable that ārūḍha should denote spirit or deity possession, it is not so reasonable in the case of apadṛṣṭi. Indeed, Bhattacharyya was surprised to find it used in this sense. Before she heard it used unmistakably in this sense, she writes, “I thought that māthāra golamāḷa was a general term for madness and apadṛṣṭi one of several causal agents of madness.”57

June McDaniel notes three general terms in Bengali to indicate religious ecstasy: bhāva, mahābhāva, and bhāvāveśa.58 All of these are Sanskrit borrowings, about which I say more below. She further isolates three types of goddess possession: (1) bhar nāmā (nāmā; to descend or alight; also bhar karā, bhar hāoẏā), oracular possession, often experienced in a state of apparent pain, in which the “person often writhes on the ground, gasping and screaming”;59 (2) āveśa, which, based strictly on McDaniel’s informants in Bengal, is defined as “an emotional state arising out of love for the deity,” a “spontaneous, nonritual possession by a deity, often accompanied by visions of lights or paradises”;60 and (3) mahā-ullās (the ritual group possession of the Sakta cakra).61 The latter is voluntary and transgressive, occurring after the participants “ingest ritual substances.”62
