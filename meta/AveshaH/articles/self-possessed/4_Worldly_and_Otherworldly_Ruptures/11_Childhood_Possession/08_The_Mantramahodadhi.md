+++
The procedures for employing children for divinatory purposes in India were not limited to a shadowy presence in a few obscure, regionally specific texts. This is similar to the situation in China, where it was relatively widespread, as Davis’s extensive documentation shows. However, even if the practice was not as widespread in India as in China, corroborative evidence from other Tantras shows that it spread beyond the confines of a few local cults. At any rate, knowledge of it appears to have entered into more mainstream Tantra sastra.[^125] The Mantramahodadhi (MM), a popular and diffuse compendium of both dakṣiṇācāra and vāmācāra tantric practice composed in the sixteenth century by Mahīdhara,[^126] includes several verses on this practice or on an adaptation of it.

[^125]: I use the word sastra guardedly in this context. Because of the amorphous nature of Tantra, it is not possible to locate a single pedagogy or set of systematics that usually qualifies the word śāstra.
[^126]: There is no evidence that this is the same Mahīdhara who composed a commentary on the Mādhyandina recension of the Śuklayajurvedasaṃhitā.

First, the sādhaka should properly worship the goddess (specific goddesses are not named here), thoroughly divinizing both himself and the maṇḍalas or yantras that he is using to replicate the goddess. This he should do by observing certain vows, divinizing his body through performance of nyāsa and enlivening the maṇḍala or yantra with other mantras, some of them complex and extremely long, totaling hundreds of syllables.  
He should then “mount a corpse either at a crossroad or a cremation ground [smasāna], abandon shame and fear, and keep his mind concentrated on the mantra (vidyā).[^127] 

[^127]: The word vidyā is a synonym of mantra.

Then, in the middle of the night, concentrated on his japa, he should hear these distant words: ‘Become transcendent and obtain complete perfection in all mantras’” (pārago bhava vidyānāṃ sarvāṃ siddhim avāpnuhi).[^128] 

[^128]: Compare this to Īśānaśivagurudevapaddhati 1.25.75: svaikyataḥ śūlinīṃ dhyātvā svasthāveso bhavej japāt (After meditating on the goddess who holds a stake [śūlinī] and realizing one’s unity with her, one should gain svasthāvesa through the performance of japa).

The text continues: 

> “He should seat two eight-year-old children born into learned families before him  
> and place his hands on their heads.  
> He should then perform japa of this mantra.  
> Both of these children will then become capable of expounding on Vedānta and Nyāya.  
> One who is curious about this ought to see for himself the wonders of this Vidyā.”[^129] 


[^129]: Mantramahodadhi 5.87–90. Cf. GOML D7763: evaṃ yantraṃ samālikhya baṭukaṃ ca tathopari / padmāsanena saṃsthāpya bhasma-mantreṇa nikṣipet / śatavāraṃ mantritaṃ ca āveśaṃ ca bhavedhṛvam / [corr.: bhaved dhruvam].

Although the instructions for this ritual do not mention possession, we must assume that it is implicit, as important components of svasthāvesa or other related practices of oracular possession are evident here.

This description is replete with marks of brahmanical orthodoxy and represents a major transformation compared to the earlier material on child mediums.  
The evidence from the earlier Tantras as well as the brief and highly specified manuscripts from southern India suggests that the tantric practices on which this description was based are here adapted to “higher” goals of brahmanical orthodoxy.  

The prasenā is not mentioned, and apparently had a short life, at least for a deity (or even a spirit), and disappeared by the sixteenth century, her shadowy station having been usurped by a Mahāvidyā[^130] or by Bhairava or Hanumān, aspects of Śiva. 

[^130]: In the earlier Śaiva and Sākta texts Vidyās served as embodiments of female divinity and existed alongside the prasenā. Mahāvidyās were “specific to the late East Indian Tantric literature and its pan-Indian development” (Sanderson, e-mail communication, October 10, 2002).

Knowledge of the past, present, and future as the goal of this sādhana was replaced by the more brahmanical goal of gaining knowledge of Vedānta and Nyāya. Similarly, the strings of bija mantras employed to invoke the Goddess and so on seem to have disappeared.

Concerning the acquisition of knowledge of Vedānta and Nyāya, it is important to note that these verses occur in a brief subsection (5.83–90) prescribing three tantric rituals to be performed on children, of which this is the third.  

The first states that after cutting the umbilical cord, the sādhaka (the father?, a hired tāntrika?) should inscribe a mantra for Vācaspati, the Lord of Speech, on the tongue of the newborn child with a sharp blade of dūrva grass that had been dipped in gorocanā, an extrusion from the biliary tract of a cow (either a large gallstone or a bezoar), which is used for tantric and alchemical purposes in India.

See Strickmann 2002 for the use of an “ox bezoar,” either alone or mixed with cinnabar. When rubbed on a certain kind of seal, it 

> “will not only summon all manner of spirits but will work large-scale geological, hydraulic, and cosmological changes as well.  
> These include shifting mountains, draining seas, causing lightning and thunder, causing darkness in the heavens and over the earth, making the sun and moon fall from the sky, and bringing clouds and rains” (p. 323n102). 

On the consumption of the human gorocana, said to be located in the heart, and the powers derived from this peculiar anthropophagy, discussed in certain Yoginītantras, see Gray 2005:55f., and for more on its identity, ibid.:47-48n8; for its use as an artistic symbol in Tibetan art, see Beer 1999:188.

Upon reaching the age of eight, the child will then become proficient in all sastras (sarvaśāstrajñatā). 

The second ritual prescribes mantras and offerings (balidāna) that enable the child to become a great poet (kavitvakṛt). Neither of these mentions possession; but it is difficult in the tantric culture of these texts to imagine that gorocanā or balidāna by themselves confer extraordinary knowledge on a child. The purpose of these offerings, certainly, was to attract spirits or minor deities to enter the child, either permanently or temporarily, thus enabling the child to recite sastras or compose poetry.

As for the uncharacteristic absence of mantras, the text of the MM is replete with strings of such mantras; indeed, this fifth chapter (taraṇga) is particularly congested with them. Thus, it may have been assumed that the aspirant has practiced certain sādhanas and mastered the complex mantras before settling in the smasāna and reciting this mantra of intent. This is supported by the earlier tantric texts and the South Indian manuscripts, all of which prescribe strings of bija mantras for this purpose. It is likely that Mahīdhara was well aware of the tantric environment and background of this practice. 

To give him the benefit of the doubt, it may not be so much that for a popular handbook he decided to opt for the sanguine over the sanguinary (there is plenty of sex and violence in this Tantra), but that he was vigilant about not losing the sometimes tenuous connection between tantric and other, more public, brahmanical practice.
