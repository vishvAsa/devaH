The question arises as to whether we can justly assume that the primary Indian source materials are in fact the basis of the practice of svasthāvesa found in China or whether China had its own indigenous sources quite apart from the Indian ones. To take this one step further, we can ask whether the advent of svasthāvesa and similar divinatory practices in India might be explained as borrowings from China, which, it is well known, had a rich history of such practices. Although I believe that we may preemptively reject this, the question arises because Davis cites Tang texts of the seventh and eighth centuries that agree almost verbatim with the Indian Śaiva and Buddhist texts that may be slightly later in composition. Furthermore, the epigraphical evidence cited above, though clearly linking the northern Saiddhāntika tradition with similar traditions farther south, fails to specify practices, as we have seen. An objection might then be raised concerning the provenance of these practices, especially because the earliest reference to svasthāvesa in South Asia, in the absence of other data, appears to be in the Harṣacarita, a text almost precisely contemporaneous with the earliest Chinese material. With this in mind, we should settle any lingering doubts regarding the matter of the direction of transmission.

Possession ritual is documented in China from the mid-first millennium B.C.E. onward, and scholars point to artistic and epigraphical evidence that might push that date back another millennium.76 Most of this speculation revolves around the issue of shamanism, which, because of cultural variation and lack of perspicacious definitions, falls prey to the same sort of amorphous characterization (and caricature) as befalls Tantra.77 Indeed, in South and Central Asia, what may have been more strictly speaking shamanistic became identified and classified as tantric, a problem that continues to find no agreeable solution among either scholars or indigenous participants. An example of this definitional vertigo may be found in modern-day South Asia, where spirit healers who might more accurately be described as shamans are widely regarded by both their clientele and scholars as tantrics, a label that they stridently eschew.78

In partial answer to our question, it must be noted that not only do the sinologists Strickmann and Davis acknowledge the Indian origins of this kind of divination (references to Ucchuṣma,79 Nāgārjuna, Gaṇeśa, and other figures traceable to Sanskrit abound), but they do not entertain the possibility of influence flowing in the opposite direction. This view is enhanced by the studies of Iyanaga, Stein, Snellgrove, Davidson, and others who have addressed the Buddhacization of Maheśvara/Rudra/Śiva and his journey to the east. Iyanaga recounts the submission and conversion of Maheśvara by Trailokyavijaya according to the Chinese and Japanese sources.80 Stein tells of the conversion of Maheśvara to Buddhism by Vajrapāṇi, “the wrathful suppressor of all evil ones,” using several Tibetan tantric sources,81 while Snellgrove describes the rise to prominence of Vajrapāṇi and his defeat of the demon Maheśvara according to the Mañjuśrīmūlakalpa.82 Davidson employs Indic and Tibetan (Sa-skya-pa) sources to relate the tale of Maheśvara’s subjugation and rebirth as Heruka, “the cosmic policeman,” and analyze historical, literary, and doctrinal functions.83 Maheśvara, says Davidson, “became one of the great scapegoats of Buddhist Mahāyāna literature.”84 As in Davidson’s passage from the Sarvatathāgatatattvasaṃgraha, Snellgrove’s from the Mañjuśrīmūlakalpa has Vajrapaṇi crushing Maheśvara with his foot. Following this, the Buddha himself “entered the body of Maheśvara and he pronounced this verse: ‘Oho! The peerless wisdom of all the Buddhas. Even a body which is dead returns to the sphere of the living!’”85 Vajrapaṇi then uttered the mantra oṃ vajra muḥ and formed a mudrā with his fingers, after which Maheśvara rose from the dead, imbued with the spirit of the Buddha, and made the world safe for mankind.

Most important, however, is the work of Robert Mayer on the assimilation of Maheśvara in Tibetan Buddhism.86 Greatly influenced by Sanderson’s work on early Śaiva Tantras, Mayer concludes that the figure of Maheśvara in Tibetan Vajrayāna (and onward into Chinese esoteric Buddhism) was a reconfiguration of this deity from the sectarian Saivism of the Indian Himalayas, specifically of the kāpālika sect.87 From there, Davidson notes, it was a short step to the transformation of Maheśvara into a powerful spirit, a Heruka under the control of Buddhist deities. It is this Maheśvara, much more prominent in India, who, in his many guises and aspects, particularly as (Baṭuka-)Bhairava and Hanumān, was possessed in the ritual of svasthāvesa and assumed a major role in other divinatory practices.88 In China (though not quite in Tibet) these guises fell away, leaving Maheśvara as a divinatory deity in his own right. The early epigraphical evidence in India testifies to the existence of the kāpālikas and other transgressive Śaiva cults89 and lends credence to the argument for a literature, now missing, that linked these epigraphical sources to the later Śaiva siddhānta texts that contained sections on svasthāvesa (and other forms of āveśa). These texts, then, must have been transmitted to Tibet and China, serving as the textual basis for oracular possession along the lines of svasthāvesa.

Sanderson’s continuing work on Śaiva and Sākta literature and traditions that derive from this demonstrates that this mountainous region was home to a large number of sects from roughly the sixth to fourteenth centuries that worshipped Śiva/Rudra/Maheśvara and a large number of goddesses, many of whom are not described elsewhere in Indic literature. This veneration was largely apotropaic and divinatory, utilizing yantra and mantra, and much of it was better preserved in Tibet (and subsequently China) than it was in India, at least in northern India. These practices found a much more agreeable home in Tibet, where Buddhism, in its “co-option of Śaiva kāpālika tantrism,”90 tamed the wild god, as the studies of Mayer et al., indicate. This was due in some measure to the influence of certain shamanistic practices in Central Asia. Regardless of the reason(s), however, Mayer tracks the taming process.91 As suggested, his primary focus is on the manner in which Buddhist mythic narrative transformed Śiva, subverting his raw, menacing, transgressive power to the aims of Vajrayāna Buddhism, assigning him a secondary place in Buddhist maṇḍalas, and so on. Two forms of this conversion appeared in Tibet, “one Mahāyoga concerning the converting of Rudra, and one Anuttarayoga, describing the converting of Bhairava.”92 It is striking that in southern India of later periods, as well as Tibet, the deities invoked in svasthāveśa were Maheśvara and Bhairava (though in India Hanumān was later added to the staff). In sum, in spite of contemporaneous, or perhaps earlier, Chinese sources, we must assume on linguistic and cultural grounds that Indic texts preceded both the Chinese and surviving Kashmiri texts. The linguistic evidence, which we now examine more closely, consists of the appearance in the Chinese texts of cognates for the Sanskrit āveśa and Maheśvara, as well as descriptions of the practices of ritual that are indisputably borrowings from India.93
