15. Cited in Kaw 1967:233, 1975:175; Sanderson 1986:176; Torella 1994:203. Śiva’s projection into the individual is fourfold: as a sensationless void (sūnyam), as internal sensation (āntaraḥ sparśaḥ), as the intellect (buddhiḥ), and as the body (śarīra) (cf. Sanderson 1986.).
16. asmad rūpasamāviṣṭaḥ svātmanātmanivāraṇe | śivaḥ karotu nijayā namaḥ śāktyā tatātmane ||
17. Cf. Utpaladeva’s Vṛtti on Śivadṛṣṭi 1.1, that samāveśa is to be practiced assiduously, after which it grants fruit commensurate with the vision it generates.
18. tasyaiva ca pallavabhūtāḥ parameśvarastutipraṇāmadhyānapūjādayaḥ.
19. See Sanderson 1986:176ff.

21. Sanderson 1986:177n33 cites only the Mālinīvijayottaratantra.
22. āveśaś cāsvatantrasya svatadrūpanimajjanāt | paratadrūpatā śambhor ādyāc chaktyavibhāginaḥ || Tantrāloka 1.173. Gnoli translates this as: “La penetrazione (āveśa) consiste nell’assunzione della natura suprema, preceduta e determinata dalla sparizione della nostra natura individua di essere non liberi. Tale assunzione proviene da Sambhu, l’originale, inseparato dalle sue potenze” (1980:92).
23. satyasvarūpe samyag ā samantāt praveśalakṣaṇam, Vivṛtivimarśinī on ĪPK 3.2.12.

25. Kaw 1967:236; citing Abhinavagupta on Īśvarapratyabhijñāvimarśinī (p. 236n35): seyaṃ dvayy api jivanmuktāvasthā samāveśa ity uktā sastre.
26. Laghuvṛtti on Parātrisikā, verse 2, cited by Muller-Ortega 1989:183; 1996: 191–192. My interpretation of this passage is as follows: “Contentment [tṛpti] is of two kinds: as a state of living liberation it is to be attained by conscious realization [lit. “recourse to the heart”]. But it is also a state of divine comportment to be attained by samāveśa on that [state of living liberation].”
27. Torella 1994:xxxiv.

29. For an explication of this text, with notes, see Singh 1963. For a statement approximately two centuries earlier than Kṣemarāja of this same identity achieved through full possession, see the first verse of the Śivadṛṣṭi cited in note 16.
30. See Bell 1992:202 for an elaboration of this.
31. See White 1996, which deals extensively with this theme.
32. Cf. Goudriaan in Gupta et al. 1979:60–62. Also Mālinīvijayottara 2.17ff. (devāgre viniveśayet, 2.17); Vijñānabhairavatantra 111–112; Kavirāj 1963:58f. Paramārthasāra supplies a formal description of śaktipāta: “As one’s face is illumined in a spotless mirror, this (Lord) who is the very embodiment of illumination [bhārūpaḥ] is revealed in the faculty of illuminated intellect [ dhitattva], which is spotless as a result of the śaktipāta of Śiva” (ādarśe malarahite yadvad vadanaṃ vibhāti tadvad ayam | śivaśaktipātavimale dhītattve bhāti bhārūpaḥ ||9||). The methodology is supplied later in the text: “When one completely realizes this supreme path quickly from the mouth of the guru, then only, as a result of this extremely intense śaktipāta, can one obtain Śiva alone, without any obstacle” (paramārthamārgam enaṃ jhaṭiti yadā gurumukhāt samabhyeti | atitīvraśaktipātāt tadaiva nirvighnam eva śivaḥ ||96||).
33. Śakti, grammatically feminine, can, however, be the property of males: cf. rudraśaktisamāveśāḥ in Mālinīvijayottara 2.17, 20.29.
34. Mālinīvijayottara 11.35 lists the qualities of śaktipāta, when constitutive of an advanced initiation, as bliss (ānanda), the awakening of kuṇḍalinī (udbhava), physical shaking (kampa), sleep (nidra), and whirling (ghūrṇi) (lakṣyec cihnasaṅghātam ānandādikan ādarāt | ānanda udbhavaḥ kampo nidrā ghūrṇiś ca pañcamī ||). The Tantrāloka mentions similar symptoms of possession by Rudra’s sakti: āviśantī rudraśaktiḥ kramāt sūte phalaṃ tv idam | ānandam udbhavaṃ kampaṃ nidrāṃ ghūrṇiṃ ca dehagām || (29.208). The commentary glosses kampa as shaking of the subtle body (prāṇātmani vāyau tatkāritvāt kampasya), nidrā as the focusing of the intellect inside the body, which occurs as a result of sleep bringing about a state in which false notions of physical consciousness cease (antas tanau buddhir puryaṣṭake tattanmāyiyavṛttinirodhāt nidrāyāḥ), and ghūrṇi or whirling as external activity which is no longer dependent on the ego (bahis tanāv ahantāvaṣṭambhabhaṇgāt ghūrṇiḥ). The commentator adds that this extremely sharp śaktipāta incinerates the pāsas (nooses) that bind one to the relative world. The Mālinīvijayottara continues: evaṃ āviṣṭayā śaktyā mandatīvrādibhedataḥ | pāśastobhapaśugrāhau prakurvīta yathecchayā || gṛhītasya punaḥ kuryān niyogaṃ śeṣabhuktaye | athavā kasyacin nāyaṃ āveśaḥ saṃprajāyate ||. See also Tantrāloka 5.100c–108b, for further associations of āveśa with śaktipāta; esp. 5.102. This can be compared to similar phenomena described in ethnographies; cf. Erndl, Freeman, etc.
35. Sax, using the Hindi ātma hil jātā hai (personal communication, June 2000). For similar notions in his work, see Sax 1991a:185, passim.
36. Diemberger 2005:120.
37. Sanderson 1994:88.
38. For general information and examples of nyāsa, see Kane HDh II.1:319f., 2.2:900, 5.2:1120ff. For descriptions of different varieties of nyāsa, see also Śabdakalpadruma 2:935ff. An important exposition of nyāsa is found in Davis 1991:47–60. The diagrams on pp. 76–82 show nyāsa being performed on one’s own body as well as on a Śiva liṇga. Khanna 1986:222ff. also contains much relevant information. Khanna (ibid.:225) cites an esoteric etymology of nyāsa provided by a Śrīcakra practitioner from Varanasi, viz. from √ni (to lead, set or fix down) and √as (to dwell or abide). In fact, however, it is surely from the prefix ni + √as (to throw or cast).
39. For example, Hanumad-Rahasyam (cf. Mishra 1971), has dozens of pages of nyāsa for different manifestations of Hanumān (e.g., five-faced, seven-faced) drawn from ritual handbooks and mantra compilations with titles such as Hanumadrahasya, Atharvaṇarahasya, and Sudarśanasaṃhitā (for more on this text, see Chapter 11).
40. This division of ritual into nitya, naimittika, and kāmya has been productive since vedic times; see F. Smith 1987:122–131.
41. parivṛttāṇgulī kṛtvā nakhāśliṣṭatalau karau | aṇguṣṭau tarjanīśliṣṭau nakhair āveśakāriṇi || (One should curve the fingers of both hands so that the nails embrace the surface of the palms, then touch the nails of the thumbs and ring fingers. [This is the mudrā that] brings about āvesa.” The commentary calls this the āvesanamudrā and glosses āveśakāriṇī as devatābhāvodbodhanakāriṇī (inducing awakening of the experience [bhāva] of the deity).
42. Cf. Flood, who writes of its presentation in the Jayākhya Saṃhitā: “The textual representation of the bhūtasuddhi is set within a sequence in which the physical or elemental body (bhautika śarīra) is purified and the soul ascends from the heart through the body, and analogously through the cosmos, to the Lord Nārāyaṇa located at the crown of the head” (2002:29).
43. Bṛhaddevatā 8.132cd: tasmān manasi saṃnyasya devatām juhuyād dhaviḥ (Thus one should offer an oblation after fully introducing the deity into the mind). See Patton 1996a:188.
44. Flood 1993:245.
45. Yoga was always (or nearly always) practiced as an adjunct to realization through theological frameworks outside Patañjali’s YS. Like Sāṃkhya, yoga has always worked better as an auxiliary to other systems, usually those self-identified as varieties of Vedānta. In the present case, haṭhayoga texts such as the Haṭhayogapradīpikā or Gheraṇḍasaṃhitā, with Nāthayoga affiliations, provided the reference points.
46. Ibid.:242.
47. Ibid., on Śivasutravimarśinī of Kṣemarāja, p. 94, commentary on Śivasūtra 3.16. The sūtra reads: āsanasthaḥ sukhaṃ hrade nimajjati | (one happily established in the posture plunges into the ocean [of consciousness]) (translation by Flood). Kṣemarāja comments: āsanaṃ paraṃ śaktiṃ balam.
48. Parātriṃśikāvivaraṇa, p. 86.
49. Flood 1993:244; PH, p. 86. Dyczkowski writes: “Abhinavagupta says that mantra and mudrā have a body made of the powers of cognition and action (jñānakriyaśaktiśarīra)” (1987:161), and PTLV, p. 11.
50. Flood 1993:283.
51. Ibid. Vijñānabhairava 68–69: vahner viṣasya madhye tu cittaṃ sukham ayaṃ kṣipet | kevalaṃ vāyupūrṇaṃ vā smarānandena yujyate || śaktisaṅgamasaṃkṣubdhaśaktyāveśāvasānikam | yatsukhaṃ brahmatattvasya tatsukhaṃ svākyam ucyate || (One should cast this sublime mind [citta] into the midst of contraction and expansion [downward and upward moving kuṇḍalinī]; this by itself or with the breath suspended yields for one the bliss of sexual union. The bliss which results from possession [āvesa-] of feminine energy brought about through orgasm [saṃkṣubdha-] during sexual intercourse with a woman is said to be the bliss of brahman that is inherent in one’s own self). See the explanatory notes on this passage in Singh 1979:65–67.
52. Cf., e.g., KālikāP 31, MatsyaP 22.13, VāyuP 6.11–23. See the visual representation of this below.
53. Nārāyanamayaṃ varma saṃnahyet, BhP 6.8.5.
54. In an important rite called śatarudrīya, “that during which the hundred names of Rudra are recited” (though in fact the designations of Rudra total far more than a hundred), the Rudra chapter is recited while milk is poured in a steady stream over the front of the left wing of the completed bird-shaped altar; cf. Staal 1983: 1:509–525.
55. The popularity of the Rudrādhyāya may be noted in its frequent use as a solo recitation in large performances. These performances, called atirudra, are fairly frequent today. In them the Rudrādhyāya is recited by eleven (because there are eleven sections in the text) or even 108 brahmans, 11 or 108 or 1,008 times, usually with offerings of rice mixed with black sesame seed into one or more fires. For example, the Sringeri Śāradā Pīṭham advertised fairly extensively (including on the Internet) for an “Athi Rudra Maha Yagnam” in 1997 to consecrate the opening of a branch of the Pīṭham in Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania. In 2006 the well-known saint Sathya Sai Baba from Puttaparthi, Andhra Pradesh, sponsored an event with 121 brahmans reciting the Rudrādhyāya 121 times per day for 11 days, with 11 brahmans sitting around 11 fires into which they made offerings after each verse.
56. V. Turner 1969:94ff., passim.
57. These are the followers of the Śrautasūtras of Baudhāyana, Apastamba, Bhāradvāja, Saṭyāṣāḍha-Hiraṇyakeśin, Vaikhānasa, and Vādhūla. Cf. Gonda 1977:514–525; Kashikar 1968:48–69.
58. Mantrapuṣpam, pp. 218–221. An earlier, nearly identical, edition was published under the title Taittirīyamantrakośa. Two of the six śākhās of the Taittirīya school of the Kṛṣṇayajurveda, Bhāradvāja and Vādhūla, are virtually extinct, with no active followers today. Of the remaining sākhas, the greatest number of those who might use the Mantrapuṣpam are followers of the Apastamba sutra texts, as they predominate in most of south India. The Mantrapuṣpam was probably composed with an audience of Apastambins in mind. Indeed, the prototype for these (and other) extended nyāsas is the camakādhyāya (hymn containing words ca me), TS 4.7.1–11 (cp. Śuklayajurvedasaṃhitā 18.1–27, cf. Staal 1983.1: 563–570 for its use in the agnicayana), in which the entire creation is, piecemeal, dedicated to the chief ritual patron (yajamana), in the first person.
59. Because the Rudrādhyāya is a prose text, there can be no identifiable poetic meter. Apparently, a ritualist who (perhaps long ago) redacted this introductory material believed that the identifying markers of a Ṛgvedic hymn—a ṛṣi, devatā, and chandas—were necessary to situate the Rudrādhyāya within the most sacred of Vedic frameworks.
60. Kilaka (nail, pin) is a tantric term indicating “fixing” of the deity in order to better obtain his or her grace or power. The terms kilana (piercing, nailing) and stambhana (immobilizing, rendering inert) are often used together to indicate ritual control of a deity. These two terms are also used interchangeably as one of the “six acts” (ṣaṭ karmāṇi) of Tantra; cf. Goudriaan 1978:263,374f.
61. Kavaca, usually translated “armor,” “shield,” etc. In the context of body parts, this makes the best sense.
62. Ripinsky-Naxon writes that “means of attaining a shamanic state of consciousness … include fasting, self-immolation, physical and mental deprivations, torture, lack of sleep and other exhaustions, ceaseless dancing, and rhythmic activities, such as drumming and chanting” (1993:142).
63. Cf. Stanley 1977:27–43. I have observed this festival twice (in 1975 and 1990), both times from atop the wall that surrounds this fortresslike temple. Without relating much detail of this remarkable spectacle, I can report that a large number of people (fifty or more) at each festival were in possession states. They were clearly dancing to a different tune, so to speak, with body movements, gestures, and articulations guided from sources other than their own conscious motivations.
64. Heesterman 1957:6; Brian K. Smith 1989, 1994; Witzel 1979.
65. I take the phrase, though not the content, from Halbfass 1995, who took it from Paul Hacker and Swami Vivekananda.
66. Cf. BhaviṣyaP 379.16, 388.1; ŚivaP 2.1.13.36; Śāradātilaka 4.78; Īśānaśivagurudevapaddhati 1.43.6, 1.47.55; Nityotsava 18.24, 20.10; Nirṇayasindhu 249.16 and elsewhere in the Purāṇas and Dharmanibandhas. Gonda describes prāṇa pratiṣṭhā as “the establishment or installation of vital breath, or life, endowment with animation, … a process of ‘consecration’” in which the images of deities “become containers of life and supranormal power” (1954:34). In addition, prāṇapratiṣṭhā is a ceremony that “serves to ennoble the worshipper to realize the presence of the divine power, God’s presence, in the image, so that it becomes an effectual means of contact between the divinity and himself” (ibid.). See also Kane, HDh II.2:896ff. on Devatā-pratiṣṭhā.
67. Cf. Devībhāgavata Purāṇa 5.34.6, which mentions prāṇapratiṣṭhā and nyāsa together. On the role of nyāsa in maṇḍala construction in Southeast Asian Hinduism, see Hooykaas 1983:541ff.
68. See Rocher 1986:157 for dates of this Purāṇa.
69. A process astonishingly similar to prāṇapratiṣṭhā is recorded in the medieval and Renaissance Christian debates surrounding the “god-making passages” in the Hermetic Asclepius. The Egyptian Hermes Trismegistus, though a Christian prophet and defender of monotheism, is said in the Asclepius to have defended practices in which the Egyptian priests would animate their temple statues by attracting the souls of higher beings to enter them. See Hanegraaff 2004.
70. Nabokov 2000:158.
71. See Hiltebeitel 1991:454–455, 465, passim.
72. Robinet 1993:103–104.
73. Ibid.:205–206. See also Andersen 1989–90:17 for an account of what may be considered a reverse nyāsa, in which millions of demigods “issue forth from my body to assist me in writing the talisman and to manifest their power and exterminate evil demons, monsters, goblins, wicked devils, and noxious influences”; also Andersen 1995, esp. 194ff.
74. For more on the diffusion and lines of transmission of related non- or quasi-Buddhist ideas from India to China, see Chapter 11. Along different lines, Victor Mair has written extensively on this project, with highly controversial results among Sinologists (see, for example, 1990:140ff.).
75. Cf. Mahāvastu 1:328, for āvesanasālā (workshop), and Senart’s note, p. 612; also Rhys-Davids and Stede 1921:113 for āvesana. See also the following lexicons: Trikāṇḍaśeṣa (1080–1159 C.E.) 3.230; Anekārthasaṇgraha of Hemacandra (1089–1172 C.E.) 4.161; Vaijayantīkośa 160.22; Kauṭilya’s Arthasāstra 2.36, also 2.14 āvesanin (artisan).
76. See Inden’s comments on “composite authorship” (Inden et al. 2000: 33–41).
77. One might imagine the appearance of many more non-brahmanized, non-Bhārgavized Mahābhāratas, such as the Draupadī cult in Tamilnadu or the Pāṇḍavalīlā in Garhwal, documented by Hiltebeitel (1988, 1991) and Sax (1995, 1996, 2002), respectively.
78. John Dunne informed me that though āveśa is discussed in Buddhist Tantras and duly commented on, the practice has almost entirely disappeared in Tibetan Buddhism, the exceptions being high-profile examples such as the Nechung oracle (personal communication, October 2001). This observation was confirmed by Georges Dreyfus (personal communication, November 2003). The example of the oracle I note near the end of Chapter 11 and other examples of spirit mediums among practitioners of Tibetan Buddhism cited in Chapter 4 must be considered differently, as their possession is not instigated by tantric initiation by lamas, nor are their oracular visualizations knowingly derived from Vajrayāna texts. Their experience is more akin to spirit mediumship found across northern India and Nepal, regardless of religious affiliation. Nevertheless, as I discussed in Chapter 4 and elsewhere, the experience of these mediums feeds into the ebb and flow of regular traffic between folk and classical that I assert has been going on for millennia in South Asia.
79. Translated from the Tibetan by John Dunne, from two works by Dalai Lama VII: Rgyal ba bska …, folio 52a3ff.; and Rgyal ba Sbkal bzang rgya mtsho.
80. Compare this to some of the Indian tantric mantras used in oracular possession discussed in Chapter 11.
81. For rather quaint notions of the “psycho-physical changes” associated with visualization, drawn from the Sādhanamālā and other texts, see Tachikawa 2000.
82. Wayman, in Lessing and Wayman 1978:162–163; see also ibid.:n17; Beyer 1973:100ff., passim. Wayman is here citing the Tibetan Tantrārthāvatāra-vyākhyāna. He also cites the Sṇags rim chen mo (338a–3, 4) to the effect that “[t]he samayasattva is the body of the deity graced with face and hands, actually the manifestation of one’s own mind, a transfiguration of ordinary ego” (pp. 163–164). The text Lessing and Wayman translated is Mkhas Grub Rje’s Rgyud sde spyiḥi rnam par ’zag pa rgyas par brjod. The text states, “One generates the Symbolic Being (samaya-sattva) and draws in the Knowledge Being (jñāna-sattva)” before applying mudrās. In a footnote, Wayman says: “The idea seems to be that the Knowledge Being is a veritable manifestation of the self-existent Buddhas, or the tenth stage Bodhisattvas such as Mañjuśrī, while the Symbolic Being is the imaginary deity which the yogin generates himself into” (p. 235). These terms frequently occur in the Sādhanamālā and the Niṣpannayogāvalī, cf. the latter pp. 7, 9. Hartzell adds the following, in his massive unpublished dissertation on Tantric yoga: “As we see in Tantric initiation sequences, a samaya-sattva or ‘covenant being’ is a Tantric initiate who has been accepted into the Tantric community and is permitted to undertake practice of sexual Yogas” (1997:889). See also Bentor’s discussion of the Tibetan “Literature on Consecration (Rab gnas),” (1996:292ff.) for the use of the jñanasattva (Tib. ye shes sems dpa’) and the samayasattva (Tib. dam tshig sems dpa’) in the generation (utpatti; Tib. bskyed pa) and consecration (pratiṣṭhā; Tib. rab gnas) of images, books, stūpas, etc., as receptacles into which the body, speech, and mind of the Buddha are to flow. Tachikawa understands jñanasattva to be “the existence of wisdom” and samayasattva to be “the existence of promise” (2000:234).
83. Beyer 1973:101.
84. See Jamgön Kongtrul Lodrö Tayé 2005:277, 278. The translators of this volume have a more elegant and exact suggestion for this process: the “ritual procedure through which the pristine awareness deities [viz. jñānasattva-s] merge with and are stabilized within the pledge deities [viz. samayasattva-s].”
85. Beyer 1973:101.
86. The Sādhanamālā does not provide the actual mantra (for which see below), but it could be sequenced similarly, replacing the masculine vajrāveśāya with the feminine vajratārāyai.
87. Sādhanamālā, p. 191. Tachikawa asked Tibetan Buddhist monks in Kathmandu about their experience of unifying jñānasattva and samayasattva. One monk commented to him that, though it is rare, “it does happen on occasion. When the unification of the two existences is obtained, the Tantric monk practicing visualization will feel pain in several parts of his body, and cannot hold his body straight” (2000:235).
88. Kalkin (on verse 87, KT vol. 2:85): asya koṭijāpena daśalakṣahomena pūrvasevāṃ kuryāt; also Dalai Lama and Hopkins 1989:446, replaces a with āḥ.
89. The commentator cites the following verse: loharatnānnagovājigajakanyāvasundharā | iṣṭā bhāryā svamāṃsāni dānaṃ daśavidhaṃ matam || (The ten kinds of gift are said to be iron, gemstones, food, cows and horses, elephants, virginal girls, land, sacrifices, one’s wife, and one’s own flesh).
90. The ingredients of this vary, but usually this mixture of “five immortal substances” consists of ghee, milk, sugar, honey, and dates. Dates, not known in ancient India, are probably a replacement for butter or another fruit.
91. In different contexts, citta can mean “mind,” “intellect,” or “thought.” In the present instance, “mind” is most apt.
92. That is to say, the possession is of the five elements (pañcamahābhūtāni) that constitute its physical form. The fifth element, ākāsa (empty space) is, in this Buddhist text, interpreted more forthrightly as “emptiness” (śūnyatā) than would otherwise be the case.
93. The Sanskrit text for all four verses reads:

    idānīṃ krodharājasya bodhisattvasya vā kāyādyadhiṣṭhānam ucyate—
    kāyāveśena yogī prakṛtiguṇavaśāt kāyakṛtyaṃ karoti
    vāgāveśena vādī bhavati ca vijayī devanāgāsurāṇām |
    cittāveśena sarvaṃ parahṛdayagataṃ jñāyate bhūtabhavyaṃ

    idānīṃ divyāveśānām utpādalakṣaṇam ucyate—
    āveśo mantriṇāṃ vai bhavati narapate bhāvanāyā balena

    na svādhiṣṭhānahīnā bahuvividhabhavair mantriṇāṃ siddhir asti ||91||
    idānīṃ āveśopaśamanādikam ucyate—
    tyaktvāveśasya paścāc chirasi ca hṛdaye mūrdhni nābhau ca kaṇṭhe
    guhye rakṣāṃ jinaiś ca svakulabhuvigataiḥ kārayet svatrivajraiḥ |
    dattāṇge pītavastrasya pihitanayanasyātra śiṣyasya veśaḥ
    saṃvṛtyarthaṃ vratāni pravaragatigatāny eva deyāni tāni ||92|| (KT, pp. 86–87)

    Thanks to John Dunne for help with the translation of the last verse. The meaning of dattāṇge remains unclear.
94. See Snellgrove 1987:205 for a related example from the KT.
95. See Granoff 1979:78, in which the Japanese word abisha, a cognate of āveśa, is given (see Chapter 11 for more on this).
96. This art of fabulous beings, mostly mythical animals, has a long history. They have been represented in Persia, Harappa, Crete, Sumer, Central Asia, and elsewhere for millennia. In India, such beasts include a variety of dragons, the griffon, the Persian simorgh, a fabulous bird of wisdom, the śārdūla (Sanskrit), and a lion, sometimes winged. The Rudrādhyāya of the Taittirīya Saṃhitā, discussed above, attests to the centrality of animals in the mythology of Rudra/Śiva in antiquity, especially in his form as Pasupati, the “Lord of Beasts.” For more on this kind of body cosmology, see White 2003:174ff.
97. For the descriptions from the Matsya Purāṇa, see Agrawala 1963:313–331; and Nagar 1993:65–70. See the latter (pp. 76–77) for the account of the iconography from the Vaikhānasāgama.
