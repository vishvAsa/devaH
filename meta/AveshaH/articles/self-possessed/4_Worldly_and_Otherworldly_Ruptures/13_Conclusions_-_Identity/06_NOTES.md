2. To the best of my knowledge, no text actively distinguishes samāveśa from samādhi. The former, it appears, indicates blissful pervasion by an external force, while the latter, in the Yogasūtras, the key text that defines it, suggests an internal pervasion that transcends relation.
3. Many other equivalent passages are found in the Yoga Upaniṣads; see the edition by A. Mahadeva Sastri.
4. See Brown 1921:153ff. for further references.
5. Cf. Csordas 1990.
6. See the articles by Koller, Larson, and Dissanayake in Kasulis et al. 1993. These articles, which do little more than examine well-known canonical doctrines, abundantly reveal the truth of Gombrich’s observations often cited here that “brahmanism inculcates control.”
7. Dissanayake 1993:39–40.
8. Staal 1993:71. See also Goodman 1990, who makes a strong case for a positive correlation between physical posture, spirit or deity possession, and states of altered consciousness.
9. The body as conceptualized in the ṚV and in India in general, as we have seen, occupied a surprisingly liminal space. Based on his analysis of the afterlife in the ṚV, Reat notes, “in Vedic thought the most essential element of the human being is his individual identity, which resides primarily in the quasi-material tanū” (1990:63). (In spite of the general absence of historical and linguistic surety in this book, Reat’s observations on tanū, at least, are sound.) This individual identity is a composite entity called ātmán in the ṚV and Yajurveda Saṃhitās. This is to be distinguished from the ātman of the Upaniṣads, where it becomes the microcosmic equivalent of the absolute brahman.
10. Staal 1993. His writing on ritual (e.g., 1983, 1990a) also demonstrates this point.
11. Tambiah speaks of Western “notions of bounded self and atomistic individualism” (1990:133) opposing the more fluid, transactional, and interactional notions of the self in Indian thought. On “fluidity” of the self in India, see Daniel 1984.
12. See the discussion in Chapter 2 on the equal attraction of possession performance to ethnographers and enculturated peoples.
13. Cf., e.g., Kakar 1982:238ff.; Koller 1993:52ff.
14. Cf. Heesterman’s felicitous statement on the Vedic ritualist’s conception of the universe: “In this world of floating forms there are no hard and fast lines; conceptually different entities and notions interchange with bewildering ease. All things, entities, notions, powers, are connected with each other. Nevertheless this world is not the chaos it appears to be at first sight. The point at issue for the Vedic thinker is not to disentangle and differentiate conceptually different entities and notions but to realize, to know, their connections” (1957:6). See also Chapter 5, n. 80.
15. This corporeal liminality is seemingly built into the Vedic language itself. Gonda observes with respect to the enigmatic power expressed by the word bráhman that it belongs to a type of Indo-European terminology that blurs the distinction between “nomen actionis and nomen rei” (1950:72), that is between action and object. This blurring, which is in fact a blurring of identity, is a characteristic of Vedic thought, and it is most visible in bandhutās such as these.
16. Cf. Csordas 1990:1ff.
17. Cf. Gupta and Ferguson 1992 for the related term, “free-floating monad.”
18. Marriott and Inden 1977; see also Marriott 1990.
19. Appadurai 1986:755.
20. Cf. Swami Vivekananda’s “vedāntafication” of the Ramakrishna Mission, amply demonstrated in Kripal 1995. See also Appadurai, who, summarizing Ashis Nandy’s argument (1983), writes that Swami Vivekananda “largely succumbed to the androcentric, linear, protestant, and activist strands in the dominant colonial culture” (1986:748).

28. See also Orsi: “Western styles of knowledge, which typically give priority to detachment over engagement, to textuality over vocality, to mind over body, are to be exposed to radically different ways of constructing and inhabiting reality” (2001:109). This, he asserts, runs counter to the priorities of the “once-dominated” and “once-oppressed” other. Doubtless this is largely true. However, one of the facets of Indian orthodoxy is that this allegedly Western style of knowledge is also true of it, though one may argue that the facets of Indian orthodoxy that interested Christian-inspired Western intellectuals were the ones most framed in this manner. The reliance of mainstream brahmanical śāstra on reason and logic appealed to Western intellectuals, especially the discourses of Nyāya, Vedānta, and Theravada Buddhism. Poetics (alaṃkāraśāstra) was taken slightly less seriously, as was Purāṇa, and, of course, Tantra and bhakti literature. All of these were more embodied, vocal, and engaged, and were it not for the intriguing character of their antiquity, most of the vedic literature would have met with the same fate, as the oft-cited derogatory comments of Max Müller, Julius Eggeling, and others testify. For these, see Tull 1989, ch. 1.
29. Cf. Kjaerholm, who states: “We do not really believe that a person can be possessed by spirits or the devil or what have you. Although this was a common belief in medieval Europe it is not generally held now, certainly not by social scientists” (1982:184).
30. See Bynum 2001, which examines twelfth- and thirteenth-century narratives of metamorphosis and hybridity.
31. Recall Varahamihira’s warning (Chapter 11) to astrologers against the use of possession.
32. Yocum 1982:193.
33. Kripal 1995:271. Kripal does not distinguish between possession and ecstatic vision (72, passim). The Kathāmṛta 4.232 contains “a self-description of how the saint’s ecstatic states used to possess him like ghosts until he finally could expel them out through his bowels” (Kripal 1995:335).
34. Bhattacharyya (1986) also demonstrates this in her work on cultural configurations of insanity.
35. I have used the word “intermedial” for this state; see F. Smith 2004.
36. In spite of the active participation of brahmans in non-brahmanic possession ritual, certain artifacts of brahmanical inhibitions remain in their performance. William Sax informs me that the bodies of low-caste people in possession gyrate more wildly than those of upper-caste members.
37. Bynum 2001:31.
38. Thus Gombrich can argue that “both brahmanism and Buddhism oppose possession and commend self-control, while the communal religion of the Sinhalese, as of the Indian, village centres, and has probably always centred, on a cult of local deities whose priests become possessed and so act as mediums to help villagers solve their problems” (1988:145).
39. Humphrey and Laidlaw see this at work in contemporary India as well, in the Jain stance towards emotional engagement in religious practice. They write, “The more puritan of our informants disapproved of [episodes of emotional engagement], in the same way, one imagines, that ‘enthusiasm’ was frostily dismissed in the eighteenth-century Church of England” (1994:228).
40. Pollock 1990:333.
41. Biardeau 1989a:21–22.
42. White discusses “vernacular ritual strategies” in his undated and not yet published paper. This is not quite identical to what I am positing here, but the article presents more evidence of the influence of “vernacular” practices on Sanskrit textuality, thus broadening the perimeters of Sanskritic culture beyond what many, including Pollock, might contend. This effectively broadens the discourse of power in Sanskritic culture, reshaping at least these elements of it to reach beyond the Mīmāṃsā-laden orthodoxy.
43. Hiltebeitel 1989b:450. We might also here consider Haberman’s description (1988:98ff., 137ff.) of male practitioners of rāgānugabhakti sadhana who wear women’s clothes. This is not mentioned in any Sanskrit text before the eighteenth century, but its presence as part of the local tradition supports and strengthens Rūpa Gosvāmī’s textuality of this sādhana in the Bhaktirasāmṛtasindhu.
44. Thus, textual, performative, and religious traditions like those arising out of the Nāṭyaśāstra and certain Purāṇas and Tantras, as well as vernacular literatures expressing the same human religious concerns, may thus be correct in envisioning themselves as the fifth Veda. On this, see F. Smith 1994.

48. See the descriptions of the nāga in Chapter 12, from bhutavidyā accounts in Sanskrit and Tibetan medical texts. These, however, do not square with what we have here. This is not the place to enter into a study of nāgas; it is sufficient to note that they occupy a place of great importance in the MBh. Generally, they are depicted as water spirits who also possess the secrets of the earth. They are alternately dangerous, poisonous, and helpful, with a reputation for divination. They may be exotic serpents or half-human and half-serpent (as appears to be the case here). In Tibet the iconography is somewhat clearer. There a nāga is typically depicted with a divination arrow and a jewel in its hands (cf. Nebesky-Wojkowitz 1956:305).
49. The story is much less complete in the Rāmāyaṇa; cf. Rām 144.15ff., esp. verse 18, and Goldman 1984:210 and notes.
50. Cf. Wadley 1999. This is perhaps not so odd, as the peripheral nature of this episode (ākhyāna) to the main action of the epic renders this aspect of it dispensable. Nor is it depicted in Draupadī epic performances in Tamilnadu or Garhwal. Neither Nala nor Damayantī are mentioned by Hiltebeitel in his Draupadī volumes or by Sax in Dancing the Self. As mentioned earlier, the Jain story of Nala excises the possession completely; he is an archetypal good king who ends up renouncing the world.
