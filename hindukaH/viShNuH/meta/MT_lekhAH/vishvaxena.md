It seems, given his name and function, viShvaksena evolved as a vaiShNava reflex of skanda. This is supported by the early kaumAra tradition where he is surrounded by the 4 vinAyaka-s like those companions of viShvaksena. Moreover, skanda played a key role in the creation of vinAyaka(-s) in one of the old traditions preserved in the voluminous skandapurANa. Notably, in a curious twist the shaiva vatulottara names skanda as viShvaksena and vishAkha as jayatsena once in the account of the AvaraNa of rudragaNa-s. An eastern tradition preserved in the merutantra records his worship along with sAtyaki -- probably an inheritance from an old sAttvata tradition which might have even conceived of sAtyaki as his incarnation.+++(5)+++

But for most part he is worship as being similar to viShNu even as nandin is related to rudra. In the tradition of saiddhAntika shaiva-s preserved by j~nAnashiva deshika he is explicitly called the lord of the viShNugaNa-s mirroring a vinAyaka like role that he gradually converged to.
