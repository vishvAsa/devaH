A humorous shArdulavikrIDita of tu~Nga indicating the presence of charchikA in rudra's retinue -

> चर्चायाः कथम् एष रक्षति सदा सद्यो नृ-मुण्ड-स्रजं  
> चण्डी-केशरिणो वृषं च भुजगान् सूनोर् मयूराद् अपि ।  
> इत्य् अन्तः परिभावयन् भगवतो दीर्घं धियः कौशलं ।  
> कूष्माण्डो धृति-संभृताम् अनुदिनं पुष्णाति तुन्द-श्रियम् ॥ 
> 
> How does he ever protect his garland of fresh human heads from Carcā? Also his bull from Candi's lion and his snakes from his son's peacock? Thus, wondering to himself about the lord's deep mental skill KūşmāņDa daily nourishes the growing satisfaction of his belly's corpulence.

(kuShmANDa is what in english could be called a hobgoblin in rudra's retinue.)
