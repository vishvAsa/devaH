## अस्यैतिह्ये मानसतरङ्गिणीकृत्
> The stotra shrI pratya\~NgirA devI passed through the lineage of hoary
  tantrics thus:
  
>  The trident-bearing shrInAtha and kaulinI roaming in kailAsha founded
  the vidyA.  
  This they taught to the ancient tantric khagendranAtha and his wife
  vijayAmba.  
  They taught it to the students of brahminical splendour first, viktaShTi
  and his dame illAIambA from the drAviDa country and second, vimala and
  his wife anantamekhalA. These were the pUrvanAthas  
  Then it passed to the great tantric master of mantra vidyAs and
  prayogas, kUrmanAtha, and his wife ma\~NgalAjyotI. They taught it to
  jaitra and his wife also named illAIambA and avijita and his wife
  AnandamekhalA. These were the dakShiNanAthas.
> 
> Then it passed to the great brahmin meShanAtha, knower of veda and
  tantra, and his beautiful wife kAmama\~NgalA, the knower of the erotic
  lores. They gave to it their student the mighty vindhya and his wife
  kullAIAmbA and the yoga master ajita and his wife ajaramekhalA. These
  were the paschimanAthas.
> 
> From them it passed for a while to the mysterious tantric of secret
  rites, vR^ikShanatha who roamed the Himalayan fastness. From him it went
  to the great ritualist mitranAtha. After him the tantric masters
  committed a fatal error in the worship of kArttikeya. Enraged, the
  six-headed god drowned the vidyAs in the ocean. There it was eaten by a
  fish. The fisherman matsyendra caught the fish and having read the book
  eaten by the fish acquired the great vidyAs as well as the great lore of
  haTha yoga. Having acquired these lores he and his wife ku\~NkumAmbA
  became the revivers of the tantra in this yuga. In addition to their six
  sons, they initiated brAhmaNas and kShatriyas who furthered the tantra.
  They were:  
  amaranAtha and his wife sillA.  
  varadeva and his wife eruNa.  
  chitranAtha and his wife kumArI  
  OlinAtha and his wife bodhA  
  vindhya and his wife mahAlakShaNA  
  guDikanAtha and his wife aparamekhalA
> 
> After them came oDIshanAtha who went from the Himalayan fastness to the
  west coast of bhArata, where he was succeeded by shrIShaShThanAtha, the
  great adept of the kaumAra lore in addition to shrI-kula and kAli-kula
  tantras. He was succeeded by shrIcharyendranAtha.
> 
> Thus, is the line of tantric teachers.
