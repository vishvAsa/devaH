> Was kAmaakhya in the remote past likely a shrine to the vaiShNavI ekAnaMshA? The kalikapurANa hints at the widespread worship as per pañcarātra  before the curse to ugratArA.

While the name ekAnaMshA isnt explicitly used in the kAlikA-pu it does heavily quote & base its vidhi on a certain lost vaiShNavI-tantra& her incantation for the basic practitioner

> oM namo mahAmAyAyai oM vaiShNavyai namo namaH |
> rakSha mAM sarvabhUtebhyaH sarvatra parameshvari ||

suggests a connection between them. The text states: 

> mUla-yonis tu kathitA vaiShNavI-tantra-gochare ||

This suggest that the deity there was indeed worshiped as per this vaiShNavI tantra in the autumnal rite. It is hence conceivable that the deity of kAmAkhyA was seen as the sister (if in an ekAnaMshA configuration) or consort of the viShNu hayagrIva at the nearby nIlAchala shrine.

The ekAnaMshA connection is strengthened by this statement in the kAlikA-pu regarding the deity:

> mUla-mUrtir mahAmAyA  
> yoganindrA jaganmayI |  
> tasyAs tu vaiShNavI-tantram  
> mantram prAk pratipAditam ||

Note yoganidrA which is an old name used for ekAnaMshA
