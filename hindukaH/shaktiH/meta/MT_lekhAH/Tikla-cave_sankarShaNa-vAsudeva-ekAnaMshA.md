Archaeologist Wakankar discovered this sketch of the saMkarShaNa-vAsudeva-ekAnaMshA triad in a cave at Tikla on the mathurA-ujjayini route. He thought it was a king& queen with an attendant holding an umbrella. Neumayer's sketch of figures & inscription below. However, the halAyudha, gadA, chakra indicate the deities. The inscription above looks like: 𑀤𑀩𑀼𑀓𑁂𑀦𑀁 𑀓𑀭𑀺𑀢𑀁 𑀑𑀟𑀸𑀦𑀓𑀺𑀢𑀁 : dabukenaM karitaM oDAnakitaM from a zoomed in image. May be it means "drawing made by dabuka" The proper instrumental would be dabukena but the dot's there

The vAsudeva reminds one of the depiction at pArthasArathI in chennai. 

The form of the brAhmI is clearly close to the Heliodorus vaiShNava inscription bracketed by middle mauryan and later kShathrapa brAhmI. So late maurya/shu~Nga era most likely. 

What exactly is ekAnaMshA holding? Some interpret it as the parasol of royal power. Such parasols are indeed seen with the chandraketugarh mystery goddess
