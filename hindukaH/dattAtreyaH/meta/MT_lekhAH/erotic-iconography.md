दत्तात्रेयं विभुं कुर्याद्

वाम-पाणि-धृताम्भोजां  
सुरूपाम् आयतेक्षणाम् ।  
तद्-दक्षिणं करं स्कन्धे  
देवदेवस्य दक्षिणे ॥ 

सव्याश्लिष्ट-प्रिया-करो  
दक्षिणे मद्यपात्रकम् ।  
पद्मस्थो घूर्णिताक्षश् च  
गातृ-नर्तनकैर् वृतः ॥ 

दत्तात्रेयस् त्व् अयं वीरो  
भुक्ति-मुक्ति-प्रदायकः ।  
अद्वैतेन विधानेन  
पूजनीयो विपश्चिता ॥
