The once vigorous lankan flavor of the Hindu tradition had several rituals with deshIya liturgies which were marginalized or exterminated relatively recently by the resurgent sthaviravAdin-s of the shAkyamata. 

Some examples included the extensive _sekra-geDi-shAntiya_, an aindra ritual. One major center of his ritual was Padeniya in lankA where a temple housed his image. Now believed to have been absorbed into the saugata vihAra where the idol is still apparently there. He is said to have sent viShNu to aid the vijayan colonization of lankA from India & along with viShNu and rudra invented the brAhmI script for the lankans to write and wrote out the word svasti as an illustration. 

Another such text was the pattinI-yAga which laid out the ritual for the goddess patnI.

Then the amara-shAntiya to various deva-s & the planetary navagraha-shAntiya. The amarashAntiya had a prAjApatya foundation as it opens with the invocation of mahA-bamba (mahAbrahmA); then sarasvatI, viShNu, skanda, indra, vaLLi ammA, kAma, vaiShravaNa, yama, agni, vAyu, the directional elephants, navagraha-s and 12 mountains

The strong kaumAra tradition is found as part the major invocations of skanda in the amara-shAntiya and pattinI-yAga and also independently in the ritual invocation of kumAra known as kanda-kumAra-sehella usually recited on ShaShTI-s. The lankan tradition preserves an interesting archaic numerical connection of kumAra (and vinAyaka) to the marut-s+++(5)+++. The myth goes that umA birthed at once *7* kids. viShNu gathered 6 of them and made them 1 kid kanda-deviyo i.e. ShaNmukha & made the other into the elephant-headed gaNa-deviyo. In the complete lankan cycle he is said to have defeated the yakSha-s while in a smaller cycle he is said to have defeated the asura-s, dwells in a 33 level palace with vaLLi ammA & some times another wife called devI. viShNu is said to have obtained for him a spear during the churning of the ocean. He said to have been in the fiery torch with which patnI burnt the pANTiyan-s (again an old motif). He is invoked as the lord of lankA and the sthavira-s were forced to grudgingly accommodate him by saying that he is the future buddha. They claimed that 1 of his gaNa established bauddham.
