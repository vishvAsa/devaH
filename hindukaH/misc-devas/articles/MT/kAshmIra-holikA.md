The old Kashmirian reflex of the holi legend is of great interest: When kumAra was born and was being nursed by umA and the kR^ittikA-s tAraka asked the bhArgava ushanas to somehow destroy him. The bhArgava uttered an incantation termed prajananI. As a result a dreadful kR^ityA emerged and rushed at kumAra. Seeing him her motherly instincts were aroused and she started secreting milk from giant mammary glands. Seeing her with kumAra the kR^ittikA-s gathered started hurling swear-words "gAlidAna" and clapping shouting the word holA holA. 

As a result she got frightened and backed off. She asked umA as to where she could go as she was hungry. umA directed her to go wherever people are engaging in gAlidAna, insulting v1s & other unclean acts and to seize the children there. The kR^ittikA-s also conferred on the kR^ityA the name holikA and a festival in her name to in the vasanta season. The Arya-s and others who observe that festival are said to get relief from the kR^ityA by the grace of rudra.
