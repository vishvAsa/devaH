> Ganesha is described in the Hayashirsha Samhita of the Pancharatra was well where he is placed along with other gods in varieties of arrangements surrounding the main vigraha of vAsudeva. In one place it's said that he should be kept along with skanda flanking the two sides of Rudra. Parama samhita also says that vinAyaka can be worshipped for some particular kAmya karma along with other gods. - shArdUla
