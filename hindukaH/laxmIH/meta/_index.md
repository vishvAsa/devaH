## माध्वम्
> In Madhwa theology Vishnu and Lakshmi are omnipresent temporally and spatially. However Vishnu is infinitely greater in "gunas" or attributes. If this is true a question arises: If Vishnu is truly greater why can't he exist without Lakshmi at some place or at some time? Shastra says it is just the will of Vishnu that he chooses thus. He is no way dependent upon Lakshmi but the opposite is true. Purandara Dasaru, in his inimitable style, narrates this is the quoted pada. He says Lakshmi has cast such a spell on Vishnu that he never leaves her. ... There is at least one guNa which HE has but SHE doesn't. Swatantrya. But yes primarily the difference is in the extent of manifestation of each guNa.

## श्रीवैष्णवम्
> Vedas do say - IshvarIm sarvabhUtAnAm & asyeshAno jagato viShNupatnI. One school says dat She is called so due to Her being His wife and not IshvarI by Herself. Another holds that all mantras hv a primary meaning and thus, a female IshvarI (to the world) but subject to Him exists.

### उत्तरकलार्याः
>  she is IshvarI & vibhu like Her Lord but still subject to Him - pati pAratantrya. Being His paTTamahiShi - wid the entire srShTi being a ritual (to give moksha to jIvas) -  She is d yajamAnapatnI who accompanies Him everywhere and doesn't leave Him ever.  Being IsvarI, she is vibhu. But of course subject to Him. 

### दक्षिणकलार्याः
> Sri is jIva but foremost among them & the reason for her omnipresence is His will.

## वैखानसम्
> Their very philosophy is called lakshmI vishiShTAdvaita. She is not independent of Vishnu nor is She a mere jIva. For them, when Ishvara takes form, He becomes lakshminArAyaNa. She is inseparable from Him & is personification of His shakti.
