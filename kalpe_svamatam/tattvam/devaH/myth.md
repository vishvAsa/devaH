title: Myths
---

## Summary
- The particular stories of deva-s (such as battles with asura-s) are not to be taken literally, according to the veda-s themselves (eg: [shatapatha-brAhmaNa asura-parAbhava part in 11.1.6](/vedAH/yajuH/vAjasaneyam/shatapatha-brAhmaNam/tattvam/shatapatha-asura-parAbhavaH/)).
- To derive benefits from the deva-s, one does not need epistemological belief in peripheral things like reincarnation, flying yogi-s, texts composing themselves, deities proffering boons and the like.
- At the same time, the hindu need not let questions like "How can monkeys talk?" hinder his enjoyment of the rAmAyaNa epics or his observance of [rAmanavamI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rama_Navami) rituals. This is exactly the same as the concept of "[aesthetic distance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetic_distance)". Consider an actor in a play: he does not think "this is not real, I am not this character, this is a made up story" etc.. when acting. Neither does the full-hearted audience (sahRdaya rasika) insulate himself from feeling empathy with the characters on stage or in a book with similar questions.

### Implications
- The nature of myths easily implies non-absoluteness/ non-literalness of texts (../More in the [bases/books page](../../bases/books/non-absoluteness/)).
- Divergence from abrahamisms, which are more "history" centric.

## Benefits
- These stories intend to teach us other things, such as
  - how to visualize and adore the deva-s
  - how to think and feel about our own (internal and social) conflicts and situations.
- In [this conversation](http://musingsofhh.wordpress.com/2012/09/23/german-christian-in-dialogue-with-balinese-on-ramayanas-historicity/) between a bAlinese hindu and a German christian about the historicity of rAMa, the pestered hindu asks: “Do you want to know whether the story is true, or merely whether it occurred?” \[Orientalism and Religion: Post-Colonial Theory, India and “The Mystic East” By Richard King, pp. 39-40\].      

## Non-literalness in Hindu traditions
dhArmika traditions comfortably got along without needing to read these as literal facts. (Eg. The concept of arthavAda.)

- [shatapatha-brAhmaNa asura-parAbhava part in 11.1.6](/vedAH/yajuH/vAjasaneyam/brAhmaNam/shatapatha-asura-parAbhavaH/)
- There are many mythic elements in the purANa-s and the itihAsa-s, which guard against them being taken too literally (as more than allegories). The very nature of the hindu deities (multiple arms, animal heads etc..) ensure that they are not taken as literal statements of fact.
- The concept of arthavAda was used in pUrva-mImAmsa to understand tales in the Veda-s, itihAsa-s and purANa-s as stories used to encourage dhArmika practice, rather than as history. However, they held that the veda-s are eternal expression of the divine order and that Vedic injunction is the sole means of knowing dharma. \[[AL01](http://www.advaita-vedanta.org/archives/advaita-l/2004-September/013449.html), [shabara-kumArIla-gangAdhara](https://archive.org/stream/slokavartika015341mbp#page/n429/mode/2up) \]
  - This concept has been used by several later traditions as well.
- Many modern and traditional scholars interpret claims and stories from hindu lore at multiple levels: Adhi-bhautika (phyiscal), Adhi-daivika (stories of the deva-s/ divine metaphors), and AdhyAtmika (spiritual allegories).

## Comparable attitudes

- Sallustius's extremely beneficial view is [excerpted here](../../darshanam/platonism/sallustius/).

Some practitioners who might regard the Gods as non-living or merely metaphorical share this attitude. (It would be a fallacy though to think that everyone who does not take myths literally does not consider the Gods true or real in a more substantial sense).

> I don’t believe anyone believes in a one-eyed man who is riding about on a horse with eight feet,” Hilmar Örn Hilmarsson, told Reuters. “We see the stories as poetic metaphors and a manifestation of the forces of nature and human psychology.” ... The priest said the gods are viewed as mystical and symbolic. Most modern worshipers don’t consider them to be living beings that are capable of flying down from the clouds. ... The Asatru religion might describe itself as poetic--but if some Christians, especially those in the Western hemisphere, were to take a literal look at the new altar to pagan gods they might consider it satanic.

## Proving myths fallacy
Despite this, some modern Hindu scholars have tried too hard "prove" myths as facts. 

nAgarAja's summary of bAlagangAdhara's thought here:

- 7\. One point is that narratives that can roughly be categorized as myth and legend have been there in a huge number throughout the world in all the ancient civilizations, in all the tribal and rural societies spread throughout the world. once the modern discipline and  category of 'history' came into existence as part of modernity, this new category along with all the elements of modernity got privileged over all other traditional forms of narrative. As a result, throughout the world, people started to attempt to prove their 'believed to be true' narratives as 'historical'.
- 8\. Meanwhile, myth became a huge obsession in the west during modern period. People from various disciplines such as philosophy, psychology, cultural anthropology, philology etc., began to theorize myth. The pejorative use of the word myth as a word for non-real , false nation etc. took back seat in the wake of all these new theories. Some of these theories viewed myth as a kind of a 'degenerated'/'corrupted' history. But most of these theories posited myth as containing a different 'truth' than the one attempted to be captured by 'science' (of which 'history' is a part).
- 9\. But attempts to trace 'historical' facts from Greco-Roman myths became a fashionable academic activity among general educated Europeans. It is such Europeans who after encountering Sanskrit books such as Mahabharata applied that approach to these Sanskrit books too.
- 10\. Thus what these European scholars did is first, they viewed Mahabharata, Ramayana as 'mythology' equating them with Greco-Roman mythology and then they did the 'looking for history' thing that they did to Greco-Roman mythology to these Indian books too.
- 11\. Many Indian scholars blindly followed both these steps closely and plunged into big debates of various competing historical interpretations of a certain story of Mahabharata, Ramayana or various Puranas.
