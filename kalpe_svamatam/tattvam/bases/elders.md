title: शिष्टः Role-models
---


## Introduction

- A great deal of importance is seen among hindus for tradition - especially formal pedigree in terms of a chain of guru-shiShya relationships.
- Where the shiShTa behavior is clearly in conflict with shruti etc.., it should be deprecated according to some (eg medhAtithi on manu [here](https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/manusmriti-with-the-commentary-of-medhatithi/d/doc200283.html) ).
- Given that the shAstra-s available to us are always incomplete, and possibly corrupted and changed to various degrees (see "Holy Books"), one might expect the behavior of shiShTa-s (role-models) to demonstrate various components of the hindu way.

## Challenges

- One's shiShTa may be another's non-shiShTa. Examples:
    - southern brAhmaNa-s violating sApiNDya prohibitions in marriage are rejected as a valid source of dharma by northerners.
    - mAdhva account of madhva's sannyAsa casting the shAnkara tradition as Asurika is found in 7-9 sargas of nArAyaNa paNDitarAja's maNimanjari \[[pdf](https://archive.org/details/ManimanjariOfNarayanaPandita/page/n21)\]. 
    - The bauddha-taint
        - pracChanna-bauddhatA charge by bhAskara and rAmAnuja [BVP17](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/bvparishat/kZikXaymSIw/Ej9695exBAAJ).

- One can never really tell if some traditional practice or non-practice originated from some respectable lost authority (sage or text) or from weakness / laxity at some point in time.
- It can be hard to tell exactly how role-models of the (distant) past behaved or thought.
    - See discussion under "history".

## Antiquity
> Traditions instinctively value historical antiquity because it signals an stable strategy to its votaries. Thus even the nirgrantha & tathAgata respectively claimed that they were one in a long series of teachers/incarnates who existed alongside known H historical figures like uddAlaka AruNi or rAma the ikShvAku or kR^iShNa devakIputra or the pANDu-s. Their tradition wrote pseudo-rAmAyaNa-s and pseudo-bhArata-s to emphasize the deep history of their mata to their followers i.e. it is antiquity was not less than that of their ortho-religious (H) rivals. 
> 
> This idea was probably quite deep in the Indian psyche -- that's why perhaps kAlidAsa actually had a verse protesting the idea that not all that is old is necessarily a positive signal. Even as late as as the 1700s the H students of Euclid commented that it has value because it
was a revelation of prajApati that had simply been transmitted by uklidasha.
> 
> One could ask then who does one reconcile innovation with this tendency. The H faced this issue with the siddha-s. The way it was done was to tether this siddha-s back to a parampara that had an archaic
root. Thus, we see some of the same siddha-s being tethered to the shaiva tradition and the counter-religious traditions. Even within tradition innovators too great effort to show their connections to the older tradition &how they stem from it. e.g. abhinavagupta linking himself
to the old tantra-s like malinIvijaya or siddhayogeshvarI-mata.

> One could ask would this not be a bad thing in science? I don't see it immediately as being the case with its best practitioners. They saw themselves as examining the a long tradition; e.g. nilakaNTha looking back at the mathematical traditions down to AryabhaTa & then picking up their good stuff while innovating. - MT
