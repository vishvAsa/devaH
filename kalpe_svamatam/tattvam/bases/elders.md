title: शिष्टः Role-models
---


## Introduction

- A great deal of importance is seen among hindus for tradition - especially formal pedigree in terms of a chain of guru-shiShya relationships.
- Where the shiShTa behavior is clearly in conflict with shruti etc.., it should be deprecated according to some (eg medhAtithi on manu [here](https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/manusmriti-with-the-commentary-of-medhatithi/d/doc200283.html) ).
- Given that the shAstra-s available to us are always incomplete, and possibly corrupted and changed to various degrees (see "Holy Books"), one might expect the behavior of shiShTa-s (role-models) to demonstrate various components of the hindu way.

## Challenges

- One's shiShTa may be another's non-shiShTa. Examples:
    - southern brAhmaNa-s violating sApiNDya prohibitions in marriage are rejected as a valid source of dharma by northerners.
    - mAdhva account of madhva's sannyAsa casting the shAnkara tradition as Asurika is found in 7-9 sargas of nArAyaNa paNDitarAja's maNimanjari \[[pdf](https://archive.org/details/ManimanjariOfNarayanaPandita/page/n21)\]. 
    - The bauddha-taint
        - pracChanna-bauddhatA charge by bhAskara and rAmAnuja [BVP17](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/bvparishat/kZikXaymSIw/Ej9695exBAAJ).

- One can never really tell if some traditional practice or non-practice originated from some respectable lost authority (sage or text) or from weakness / laxity at some point in time.
- It can be hard to tell exactly how role-models of the (distant) past behaved or thought.
    - See discussion under "history".
