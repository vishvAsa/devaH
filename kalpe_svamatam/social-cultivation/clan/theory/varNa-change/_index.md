title: Varna change
---
## brahma-xatra movements
- Generally, transgression of kShatriya-s into brAhma tends to have a subversive tendency (bauddha, jaina, sikh matas). Transgression of (non-fallen) brAhmaNas into kShAtra (as in shunga-s, kadamba-s and marATha-s) generally tended to produce conservative rulers.

## Routes
- Marriage route: It was theoretically possible to rise in varNa in a few generations by means of a series of a series of marriages. But there is nearly no evidence of this happening in practice.

$## Ritual and reincarnation route 
- Possibly from ritual success: SB 10.4.1.10 \[[SB](https://archive.org/stream/SatapathaBrhamanaMadhyandinaEd.SridharSharmaVol10NagPublications/Satapatha%20Brhamana%20Madhyandina%20Ed.%20Sridhar%20Sharma%20Vol%2010%20Nag%20Publications#page/n171/mode/1up), [SB_tr](https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.48505/2015.48505.The-Satapatha-brahmana--Pt-4#page/n373/mode/2up)\]
- AB 7.29 \[[sAyaNa](https://archive.org/stream/Anandashram_Samskrita_Granthavali_Anandashram_Sanskrit_Series/ASS_032_Aitareya_Brahmanam_with_Sayanabhashya_Part_2_-_Kasinathsastri_Agase_1896#page/n352/mode/1up)\] speaks of offspring of a kSatriya sacrificer becoming brAhmaNam/vaishya/shUdra due to ritual errors.

### Fall in varNa
- It was relatively easy to fall in varNa (though not encouraged). The dharmashAstra-s allowed each varNa to take up the profession of the varNa following it, in case of trouble or inability to sustain oneself and one's dependents using one's own permitted avocations; though one was required to return to one's profession when the trouble was past. Within 3-4 generations, this change would be permanent.
- kShatriya-s and brAhmaNa-s taking up the profession of vaiShya-s.
- brAhmaNa-s taking up the profession of kShatriya-s.


### Ascent to brAhmaNa-hood
- kApAlika-s, supposedly founded by a vaishya and his shUdra student, attempted significant subversion of the varNAshrama-dharma - as attested by rAmAnuja. \[[MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2005/03/26/dvijas-and-non-dvijas-in-the-shaiva-cults/)\]
