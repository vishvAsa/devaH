+++

- Access is, of course, graded. This is a consequence of the allowance for exclusivism in the hindu way (see [here](../self-cultivation/communal-support/exclusivity/)).
- Neo-Traditional female brAhmaNI ritual specialists - [IMG](https://imgur.com/qBfxxQI).
- Ritual purity and mestural cycles
    - A mensturating woman is considered ritually impure for most purposes.
        - This is atleast as old as Apastamba shrauta sUtra \[[IMG](https://i.imgur.com/6MS3I5u.jpg)\].
    - yAga-dIxa overcomes this \[[IMG](https://i.imgur.com/6MS3I5u.jpg)\].

## Access to veda-s 
- \[Discussions - [BVP](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/bvparishat/0n41vcuW9E0/6vLNNRViDQAJ)\]
- Not uncommon access for brahmavAdinI-s in texts.
    - हारितः \- "तत्र ब्रह्मवादिनीनाम् उपनयनम्, अग्नीन्धनम् वेदाध्ययनं स्वगृहे च भिक्षाचर्येति।"
    - Women got the upanayana initiation (as a symbolism before marriage or as a serious initiation depending on the case) well into the gRhya-sUtra and early dharma-shAstra ages (काणे-विचार-सारो [ऽत्र](https://archive.org/stream/HistoryOfDharmasastraVol.IIPartIPandurangVamanKane/History%20Of%20Dharmasastra%20-%20Vol.%20II%20Part%20I%20-%20Pandurang%20Vaman%20Kane#page/n345/mode/2up)।)
    - "पुरा कल्पेषु नारीणां मौञ्जीबन्धनमिष्यते । अध्यापनं च वेदानां सावित्रीवचनं तथा ॥"
- Access to upavIta : see [upavIta](../../../AchAraH/saMskAraH/upavItam/).
- Patanjali gives some examples in स्त्रीप्रत्ययप्रकरणम्--
    - काशकृत्स्निना प्रोक्ता मीमांसा  काशकृत्स्ना  \- that means काशकृत्स्ना was a Vedic scholar .
    - औदमेय्याः  छात्राः  औदमेयाः \- there were good and great women scholers .
- Other examples of requiring women to say vaidika mantra-s - kANe [here](https://archive.org/stream/HistoryOfDharmasastraVol.IIPartIPandurangVamanKane/History%20Of%20Dharmasastra%20-%20Vol.%20II%20Part%20I%20-%20Pandurang%20Vaman%20Kane#page/n417/mode/2up).
- There are many examples of female deities wearing yajJNopavIta - but what applies to the Gods don't apply to us :-)
- Apastamba says - पाणिग्रहाणात् सहत्वं कर्मसु पुण्यफलेषु च ।
