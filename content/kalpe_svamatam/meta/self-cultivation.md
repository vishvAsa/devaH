title: Self cultivation
---

A personal note: I enjoy chanting (especially bits of the vEda-s I know), doing Asanas, various niyta and naimittika karmas. Repeating well crafted mantra-s, until a pinnacle of mood, memory and understanding is reached, is a favorite 'meditation'. Thence I enjoy benefits such as courage, steadfastness in the dharma, joy etc.

## The goal

Hindu self-cultivation gives one joy, satisfaction, and strength to follow and achieve the various goals of life(puruShArtha), including [dharma](../../social-cultivation/dharma/). This includes attainment of mystic "highs" as a matter of course. With spiritual practices and saMskAra-s, a hindu gets both intellectual and emotional appreciation for his place in the world-tree.

## Genetics and circumstance
One's circumstance determines to a great extant the level of practice and conservativism suitable for oneself. Genetics is a great determinant of conservativism vs liberalism, for example.

## Hierarchy in practice
The wrong, but unfortunately popular hierarchy of spiritual practice: Adorers of the Absolute > Adorers of personal deities > Adorers of incarnations > Adorers of myriad ancestors, sages and deities > adorers of petty forces and spirits \[rAdhAkRShNan [T](https://twitter.com/blog_supplement/status/640585969859694592)\].
