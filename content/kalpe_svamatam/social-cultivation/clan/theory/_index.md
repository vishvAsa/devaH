title: +varNa theory
---

varNa/ jAti = (social role/ hereditary caste) system.  

## Theoretical Structure
- A chAturvarNya universalism. The dharmashAstra-s claimed to explain the origin of EVERY SINGLE population they were aware of - out of admixture and fall of the 4 original varNa-s.​ According to the early smRti-s there was no fifth ([PVK1](http://i.imgur.com/l0XuhbQ.jpg), [PVK2](http://i.imgur.com/LRHL6vV.jpg)). This is a sort of universally applicable framework. They had various  (sometimes peripherally incompatible) theories for their origins, and the ultimate varNa assignment was very very clear. Even the deities had varNa-s \[[PVK](https://archive.org/stream/historyofdharmas029210mbp#page/n99/mode/2up)\] assigned to them! 
- The 4 main varNa-s were the brAhmaNa-s, kShatriya-s, vaishya-s (ie dvija-s) and shUdras, who were of two major categories - aniravasita and niravasita.
    - Besides these there were tribes who were not following the varNa-system (perhaps because of living in distant lands or in inaccessible places), who were termed as dasyus. They were also termed mlechCha-s if they spoke a very different language.
    - In some later works, niravasita-shUdra-s were called avarNa-s (bRhatsamhitA [89.1b](https://archive.org/stream/Brihatsamhita/brihatsamhita#page/n709/mode/2up)).

### Prominent traits in the varNa-s:
- A gradation in several regards
- Difference in the dominant or prominent occupations.
- Hereditary nature for the most part.
- Restrictions on interdining, marriage, occupation.
- Different expectations in terms of conduct and personality traits (guNa-s)
    - Gita 18.41says: " ब्राह्मणक्षत्रियविशां शूद्राणां च परंतप। कर्माणि प्रविभक्तानि स्वभावप्रभवैर्गुणैः।।" Nilakanthacharya commentary takes close adherance to the shamAdi-sAdhAraNa-dharma as an example of contrast: "तस्माद्यस्मिन्कस्मिंश्चिद्वर्णे शमादयो दृश्यन्ते स शूद्रोऽप्येतैर्लक्षणैर्ब्राह्मण एव ज्ञातव्यः । यत्र च ब्राह्मणेऽपि शूद्रधर्मा दृश्यन्ते स शूद्र एव ।"
        

## Gradation
- General respectability: We don't have the slightest problem loving the mahAbhArata written by the rustic smelly son of a fisherwoman (mentioned thusly in the mahAbhArata) about her descendents, with shUdra heroes like vidura the brahmajjnAnI cum super-archer, ekalavya, ghaTotkacha; while simultaneous supporting a more fluid social dynamic.
- Gradation relative to each other (despite their complementaryness)
- brAhmaNa >= kShatriya > vaiShya > aniravasita shUdra > niravasita shUdra >= populations outside not following chAturvarNya (dasyu-s). 
    - This hierarchy was justified using hypothesized karma from past lives.
        - Eg. bhAgavadgItA calling women, shUdra-s and vaishya-s pApa-yonis.
- The recommendation by medhAtithi about expanding AryAvarta by a king subjugating the mlechCha-s, and relegating them to the position of chaNDAla-s (niravasita shUdra-s) should make the view of dharmashAstra writers about the place of mlechCha-s in the hierarchy abundantly clear ([PVK_IMG](http://i.imgur.com/rWyjGFD.jpg)). They were considered impure and untouchable ([PVK](https://archive.org/stream/historyofdharmas029210mbp#page/n225/mode/2up)).
- Consequently, difference in the severity of daNDa (punishments) and , with authorities such as manu and vyAsa prescribing (in nearly all cases) heftier punishments on higher castes.
- This was motivated not just due to importance of social function, but also because of severe codes of conduct and refinement (tapas and samskAra), as described in the Motivation section.

## Mitigations and limitations (barring rare exceptions)

- On the positive end, one observes rarity of the more severe forms of slavery - unlike slave societies of Greece, Rome, Islamic states, early USA. The dharmashAstra tradition forbids any enforcing service by those bound by dharma ("न च बलात् स्वीकर्तव्यः…" [shabara on MS7,6,6](https://imgur.com/a/BWs34%5C), [tr](https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.282745/2015.282745.Sabara-Bhasya#page/n493/mode/2up)).
    - Example - Megasthenese [TW1](https://twitter.com/Rjrasva/status/721326921724882945).

## Marriage restrictions
- Restrictions on marriage: endogamy > anuloma exogamy (male of higher caste) > pratiloma exogamy.
- varNa-s resulting from anuloma unions were considered dvija-s.
- pratiloma unions (formal or otherwise) were severely discouraged, and their offspring were considered shUdra-s or worse \[[PVK](https://archive.org/stream/historyofdharmas029210mbp#page/n109/mode/2up)\]. "शूद्र.सधर्माणो वा, अन्यत्र चण्डालेभ्यः ॥" \- कौटिल्यः।
    - This applies to suta-s (theoretically illegitimate offspring/ descendents of xatriya males and brAhmaNa females) as well \[[PVK](https://archive.org/stream/historyofdharmas029210mbp#page/n155/mode/2up)\]. The sUta and mAgadha of purANa-s is entirely different according to (kauTilya ०३.७.२९) पौराणिकस् त्व् अन्यः सूतो मागधश् च, ब्रह्म.क्षत्राद् विशेषः ॥


## Role of later traditions

Some people falsely generalize later anti-varNAshrama traditions. 

- Agamika pAncharAtra tradition strongly supports varNAshrama-dharma.
    - See quotes in the "Unrestricted ability to enter intellectual/ spiritual life" section.
- shaiva-siddhAnta supports varNAshrama-vyavasthA.
    - वर्णाश्रमाचारान् मनसापि न लङ्घयेत्॥ यो यस्मिन्नाश्रमे तिष्ठन् प्राप्तो दीक्षां शिवात्मिकाम्। स तस्मिन्नेव संतिष्ठन् शिवधर्मं च पालयेत् - श्रीमद्भार्गवागमः as quoted by लक्षद्वयाध्यापक-श्रीमदघोरशिवाचार्य ... siddhAnta shaiva did not forsake his Ashrama or varNa when he attained dIkSha into the shaiva path and was not a means of “revolting against” or “escaping” the ordinances of the Aryas. ... the general followers were encouraged to maintain their existing life-style/profession and varNa-related observances, while accomodating the shaiva observances with that framework. In fact the basic dharma-shAstric injunctions are relating to other nitya issues are reiterated by the shiva-dharma." \[[MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2006/06/23/siddhanta-tantrics-and-the-mainstream-brahminical-path/)\]

## Subversive theory
Anti-varNa teachings are seen among a few traditions - see [subversion page](../../../rivals/ananda-addiction/) and [Ananda addiction page](../../../rivals/ananda-addiction/).
