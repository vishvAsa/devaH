## Intro

An individual's life passes through various phases. Important among them were described and suggested by dharma-shAstra writers with the view of bringing and maintaining individual and social harmony. Phase transitions were especially marked. Following are the four major stages of life: 

- brahmacharya - Student life, starting with upanayana and ending with samAvartana.
    - naiShThika-brahmacharya, starting with a special ceremony after samAvartana. "He may also rekindle the fire with a ‘substitute wife[10]’... he may rekindle the fire alone for himself[11] (Trikandamandana 3.128) and taking Shraddha (faith/conviction) as his ‘substitute wife’ may perform agnihotra etc. " [Nithin](http://indiafacts.org/sati-dharmic-perspective/#_ednref14)
- gRhastha - Householder life, starting with vivAha/ marriage. The most important Ashrama, for this is where family traditions are maintained. 
    - brahmachArin-s taking up sannyAsa or vAnaprastha without marriage is criticized.
        - Eg. indra in MBh - "ke cid gṛhān parityajya vanam abhyagaman dvijāḥ/ ajātaśmaśravo mandāḥ kule jātāḥ pravavrajuḥ/ etc.." \[[GA16](https://twitter.com/GhorAngirasa/status/756753649888481281)\]
    - Mate choice and marriage maintenance - [KV18](https://agnimaan.wordpress.com/2018/04/08/marriage-advice-for-hindu-snataka-s/).
    - "Hindu parents rooted in Dharma are living temples." \[OGS\]
- vAnaprastha - Retirement to forest. (vaikhAnasa-gRhya-sUtra gives a procedure for transition to this Ashrama, while others don't.)
- sannyAsa - Asceticism in pursuit of mokSha or Ananda, mostly to the neglect of pravRtti-dharma.
    - Not at all dealt with by the gRhya-sUtra-s - some say because it is out of scope, others say that this is because this Ashrama was unknown, unpopular or frowned upon.
    - Early mention in the bRhadAraNyaka. An easy extension of the naiShThika-brahmachArI concept. Possibly later gained more and more acceptance due to the influential shramaNa streams.
    - Rejected by several later texts as kali-varjya.
    - The controversial role of Ananda-pursuit in the neglect of dharma by hindu-s is to be considered.
