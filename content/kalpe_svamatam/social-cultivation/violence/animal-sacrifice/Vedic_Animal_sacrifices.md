  - kapinjala-adhikaraNa of mImAmsa-shAstra is a classic illustration (where the question of how many kapinjala birds are to be sacrificed is considered).
  - Certain compulsory पशुयाग-s (usually goat sacrifices) are required of agnihotri-s Eg: निरूढपशुबन्धः. \[Note: Optional cow and horse sacrifice exist, but are barred by the dharma-shAstra-s in the kali-yuga.\] Recent examples - [DH](http://www.deccanherald.com/content/544227/brahmins-hold-yaga-sacrifice-goats.html)16.
  - gavAlambha / cow sacrifice is also referred to in the manu-smRti, and others (eg: as part of madhuparka). Reference sample below.
  - Honoring a guest:
      - "Madhuparka is the practice of offering honey to honour a distinguished guest. According to Yājñavalkyasmṛti 1.110, six kinds of people are offered madhuparka – a priest (ṛtvik), a teacher (ācārya), bridegroom, king, graduate (snātaka), and someone dear to the host. The Baudhāyana Gṛhyasūtra 1.2.65 adds ‘guest’ (atithi) to this list. As part of madhuparka, honey, curds, ghee, water, and grains were offered while meat was optional (See Āśvalāyāna Gṛhyasūtra 1.22.5-26 for more details)."
- Substitutions are endorsed in specific cases
    - "in the varuNapraghAsa, piSTarUpakas of sheep and ram are offered to the marut devas (the praghAsas)".
