## Sexual deviance
"The primary function of sex in eukaryotes is recombinogenic generation of diversity that evolved as response to the life-and-death pressures of biological conflicts. Hence, any sexual activity that does not satisfy this function is clearly either of secondary value or maladaptive
 or accidental(not significant).
 
 Several instances of atypical sexual activity like svali~Ngamaithuna in various animals is simply accidental or the main function misfiring. In several primates, in particular the Homo-Pan clade sex has a secondary signaling value. In 1 member of
 this clade Pan paniscus it does seem that homosexual coitus might have some signaling role. The evidence that it has a similar role in extant Homo is v limited or even unlikely. For most part but not entirely atypical sexuality has a biological basis.

Unfortunately, the use of it as a political weapon in the mlechCha-controlled world makes a proper study of biological bases of atypical sexuality difficult if not impossible. Hindus& India needs to reject outright this mlechCha attitude & conduct objective studies on atypical sexuality that can then inform policy decisions regarding it. Some common hypothesis about homosexuality in particular include :
1) genetic mutation(s); 
2) a by product or intentional effect of a pathogen infection especially perinatal; 
3) environmental substances; 
4) brain damage from other causes. 

2, 3 can in principle elicit their effects via epigenetic changes. Currently the evidence in favor of the genetic hypothesis is weak & generally contrary to foundational biological principles unless rampant bisexuality was/is the norm. 2,3 remains possible but have certain problems that need to be resolved before these hypothesis can be seen with certainty. Where there is some "leftover" tendency due to the signaling use in P.paniscus that is easily triggered in Homo needs to be explored further. Moreover, it is clear that all homosexuality is not the same.

...
I think that the presence of the behavior apparently playing a signaling role in our cousin P.paniscus suggests that there might be some 'weak link' in the inherited legacy code that could tip things in that direction due to relative minor lesions. What those lesions might be remains unclear. (Regarding analogous situations with other abnormalities -) One may cite appendicitis; allergies from the IgE system dysfunction as possible analogies in very different organ systems.
...

My general rule of the thumb is that any sexuality, typical or atypical, should not be criminalized as long as it does not result in harm to others in society or reduces the group fitness of a society. Further, its practitioners, just as with typical sexuality, should not engage in public displays of overt sexuality that might be deemed indecent or disruptive. Something which is atypical cannot be considered the norm either just as one eyed or 6-fingered individuals are not the norm. Policy should have mooring in the central tendency while acknowledging natural variation. It is not correct to celebrate all extreme deviations from the central tendency. Some can be useful but some extremely dangerous. Hence, individuals displaying those forms of atypical sexuality which result in harm to others should be contained just as with other neurological conditions.

Another rule of the thumb: Not all ideas of the mlechCha-s are good. Those pertaining to atypical sexuality are outright dangerous and could destroy a nation which adopts them. Hence, H and India need to take their own path block out mlechChatvam." {- [MT](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1017617003618689024.html)}

"The basic sexual orientation is mostly biological; hence, it is hard to change.  Typical or atypical, the basic preference is going to be innate. However, if a society cultivates homoerotic behavior it can take root as illustrated by several medieval Islamic societies& earlier the Macedonians. This does not imply a change in innate orientation but because in such societies its practice is cultivated from an early age it takes the place of a certain form of sexual self-stimulation or release that males in some animals like Homo & probably certain whales typically need. If such practice is sustained over a period along with enforced bisexuality we might actually see the extended survival homosexuality, especially if there is some genetic predilection. That's how I see it in the Mogol tyrant Baboor, or Mahmud Ghaznavi, Khalji etc ... In contrast in societies like H where it received no encouragement unlike in their Mohammedan neighbors (post-occupation) it never rose in frequency -- an observation which did not miss the eyes of the English tyrants. ... I am aware of a v.famous scientist who claimed he was gay to start but went on to stably marry and have multiple kids & remain so. Another Jewish academic suddenly claimed that she became lesbian for few years then lost and regained libido with preference for males. All of this needs more thorough investigation but looks mostly like gimmicks to look "cool and liberal" to me. However, my position is on nature side simply stating that under certain circumstance the frequencies can be jacked up by societal encouragement for behavior. *If* there is a genetic basis and there is pure homosexuality natural selection will eliminate it. However, if it is allowed along with enforced bisexuality then such behaviors with genetic background can linger. Baboor himself records that in is family there were people with deviant sexuality. Hence, his own condition could be genetic which survived due to enforced bisexuality. After all his own line of tyrants continued due to that." {- [MT](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1017617003618689024.html)}
