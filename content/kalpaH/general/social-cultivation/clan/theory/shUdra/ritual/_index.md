## Intro
-   There were many dīkṣa-s available to the śūdra-s, prescribed in the purāṇa-s and the tantra-s. Furthermore, in several critical places, the dharmaśāstra thinkers are not 
-   The most popular and the dearest modes of Hindu spirituality in the past two millennia were (perhaps by definition) very much open to śūdra-s. For example:
    -   Adoring images, trees, animals or instruments.
    -   Constructing and patronizing temples.
        -   The smṛti-s, in fact, rarely ever talk about temple adorations. That is the domain of the āgama-s, which do not at all claim monopolies on running temples.
        -   Nirṇayasindhu quotes the authority of purāṇa-s to enable even the “untouchable” populations to construct bhairava temples.
    -   Pilgrimage.
    -   Non-vedic (purāṇic/ āgamika) fire sacrifices - various āgamika homa-s.
    -   Non-vedic animal sacrifices.
    -   They could certainly do pūrta-dharma (building of wells, temple-building, distributing food etc..), if not the iṣṭi-s (vaidika sacrificies involving similar ritual donations).
    -   Chanting and singing non vaidika mantras, stotras and songs.
    - shUdra and mlecCha access to pAkayajJNa-s and pUrta-s

        - gautamadharmasūtra 10.65
-   A greater period of ritual impurity after events such as death.

### Summary
-   Śūdra-s are ineligible for most vedic sacrifices according to most dharmaśāstra texts.
-   Even brāhmaṇas don't do most vedic sacrifices.
-   Śūdra-s along with brāhmaṇas have been worshipping idols, trees, animals etc.. and hence the ineligibility doesn't matter in practice.

## Vedic study
-   Studying the veda was prohibited. Gautama-dharma-sūtra (an influential early work) even barred them from hearing it.
-   There are hints that this restriction was not in place in the distant past. For example, Bādari (an early mīmāṃsa scholar) advocates that śūdra-s too could study the veda-s (PMS 6.1.27).
-   They were explicitly authorized to repeat various popular non-vedic mantra-s and there was no restriction whatsoever on repeating non-vedic poetry.
