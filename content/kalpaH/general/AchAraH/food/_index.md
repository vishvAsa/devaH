## Liquor
- trantravArttika - [TW1](https://twitter.com/GhorAngirasa/status/913890316503195648), [TW2](https://twitter.com/GhorAngirasa/status/913892342448476161) opines that only brAhmaNas are completely prohibited from alcohol, shUdras have no prohibitions at all & that kSatriyas are allowed to drink the alcohol named madhu (fruit wine) and are only prohibited from surA (liquor from rice and other grains such as barley).

## Ancient recommendations:
- "For example, we learn that food was eaten while being seated (Rigveda Saṃhitā 4.30.3), food was eaten only twice a day (Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa 1.4.9), and that talking was kept to a minimum while eating (Baudhayana Dharmasūtra 2.7.2). In times of emergencies, there were absolutely no restrictions on food (Brahma Sūtra 3.4.29-31). We are asked to greet our food, honour it, rejoice upon seeing it, and pray that we may always obtain it (Manusmṛti 2.54-55)." [SG15](http://indiafacts.co.in/the-hindu-view-on-food-and-drink/).
- Veg promotion
    - "मुन्यन्नं ब्राह्मणस्योक्तं मांसं क्षत्रियवैश्ययोः " इत्यादि वाक्यं तु याज्ञवल्क्यस्मृतेः (१.२६१) मिताक्षरायां पुलस्त्यस्मृतेरुद्धृतम्।

### Meat restriction
- अपञ्चनखेषु
    - अभक्ष्यो ग्राम्यकुक्कुटः अभक्ष्यो ग्राम्यसूकरः। (महाभाष्ये)
- पञ्चनखेषु
    - पञ्च पञ्च नखा भक्ष्या ब्रह्मक्षत्रेण राघव 4.17.38।। शल्यक श्श्वाविधो गोधा शशः कूर्मश्च पञ्चमः। (नान्ये)

### कवकानि
- Likewise a mushroom with an umbrella-shape ChattrAkAara is proscribed in the dietary laws of V1s. medhAtithi on manu [here](https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/manusmriti-with-the-commentary-of-medhatithi/d/doc200379.html). 

## Factors towards vegetarianism. 
- Historical reasons. Why do many types of hindu-s not eat meat? Because their parents and relatives did not eat meat, and they have no idea why, and it is now a matter of cultural identity. Ok, why did this practice start and why was it sustained?
- Primary reasons:
    - the theory that food influences feelings and behavior, in a way not appropriate for these peoples' traditional vocations. Meat is \_supposedly\_ rAjasika-tAmasika-guNa-pradhAna, and rare are the agnihotR-s who can cope with it in this age.
    - The karma theory: a person who eats meat will—in his next birth—become the meat eaten by that animal (Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 9.6.1.3).
- Secondarily, the veda-s and other holy texts urge non-violence as described [here](../../social-cultivation/violence/) (barring exceptions).
- Additional reasons
    - Sustainability
