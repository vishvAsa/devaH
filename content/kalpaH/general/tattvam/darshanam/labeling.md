title: Labeling

## Avoid hair-splitting
With regards to distinctions such as "Astika/ nAstika", "dvaitin/ advaitin", "saguNa/ nirguNa", "only one Atman which is expressed differently in different bodies vs many Atman-s" etc..,  we suggest that you pride yourself for being a unqualified, generic (nirvishiShTa) hindu. Rather, speculation should be freely admitted where necessary; and the advaita / dvaita etc.. points of view (darshana-s) should be used and discarded as necessary, like therapy.

## Suitable labels
- "Spirituality", if it means "a deep emotional connection with nature/ universe", is apt too.
- "Modern orthodoxy", analogous to what is described [here](https://agnimaan.wordpress.com/2015/08/31/modern-orthodoxy-as-a-glue-between-the-ultra-orthodox-and-the-liberal-the-jewish-example/), is apt also.


## Hindus with updated beliefs.

Many highly regarded, erudite and practicing hindu-s are/ have been quite happy to update their belief systems with modern scientific findings (eg: theory of evolution). They too do not find the concept of karma and rebirth to be central to the hindu tradition which they hold so dear.

- Kalavai Venkat, the writer who always signs underneath his articles : "atheist, a practicing orthodox Hindu" (eg: [here](http://www.indiafacts.co.in/chennai-bomb-blast-islamic-psyche/#sthash.sbCudF0Z.DVLvivr8.dpbs), CRI [articles](http://centreright.in/author/kalavai/#.VCwLtHWx3UY)).
