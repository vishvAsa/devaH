- उत्तरनारायणः पुरुषो वा यस्य "नक्षत्राणि रूपम्, अश्विनौ व्यात्तम्" ([MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2013/11/08/anatomy-and-heavens-in-the-boomorphic-universe/), आरण्यके [ऽत्र](https://archive.org/stream/taittiriya/taittiriya_aranyaka_bhaskara_01#page/n309/mode/2up))
    - " This tradition of stellar puruSha continued down to the purANa-s (e.g agnipurANa chapter 196) and is also specified in detail in the 105th chapter of the bR^ihat-saMhitA of the great naturalist varAhamihira. In this later version the nakShatra puruSha is also invoked as viShNu (shAmbhavAyanIya ritual) during every month of the year. ...In the parallel later bAdarAyaNIya ritual, the stellar prajApati is comprised of rAshI-s instead of nakShatra-s. "
