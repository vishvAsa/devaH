Honneur des Hommes, saint Langage 
Discours prophetique et pare . . . 

Valery, La Pythie

L-ztarting from one theme chosen among many, this self-styled 
first reconnaissance over uncharted ground has come a long and 
tortuous way since the early introduction of the Hamlet figure. 
The discussion has touched immense areas of myth whose probable 
value was indicated by previous discoveries. The treasures of Celtic 
tradition, of Egypt, China, tribal or megalithic India, and Oceania 
have barely been sampled. Nevertheless, the careful, inductive ap¬ 
plication of critical standards of form along the belt of High Civili¬ 
zations has been enough to show the remnants of a preliterate “code 
language” of unmistakable coherence. No apologies are needed for 
having followed the argument where it led, but it is very much to 
be hoped that what has been uncovered will eventually prove suffi¬ 
ciently self-correcting to amend the inevitable errors of this essay. 

What can the initial universe of discourse have been, that insen¬ 
sate scattering of dismembered and disjointed languages of the re¬ 
mote past, of earthy jargons and incommunicable experiences, from 
which, by a stroke of luck, scientific man was born? Clearly, man’s 
capacity for attention, for singling out certain unattainable objects 
in the universe, must have overcome the convolutions and horrors 
of his psyche. There were some men, surely exceptional men, who 
saw that certain wondrous points of light on high in the dark could 
be counted, tracked, and called by name. The innate knowledge 
that guides even migratory birds could have led them to realize that

the skies tell—yea, recount—the glory of God, and then to con¬ 
clude that the secret of Being lay displayed before their eyes. 

Their strange ideas, inscrutable to later ages, were the beginnings 
of intellect, and in the course of time they grew into a koine, or 
lingua franca, covering the globe. This common language ignored 
local beliefs and cults. It concentrated on numbers, motions, mea¬ 
sures, overall frames, schemas, on the structure of numbers, on 
geometry. It did all this although its inventors had no experience to 
share with each other except the events of their daily lives and no 
imagery by which to communicate except their observations of 
natural lawfulness. 

Ordered expression, that is expression in accordance with laws 
or rules, comes before organized thought. After that, the spon¬ 
taneous creation of fables occurs when there is a fund of direct 
experience to draw upon. For example, a prehistoric “tech talk,” 
expressing only lawfulness in the grammatical or natural sense, may 
have begun by using terms that came from the earliest technology. 
Later, as experience increased, the same kind of talk using the same 
terms may have been extended to include alchemy and other imag¬ 
eries. In form, these exchanges would be transmuted tales, but 
because of their terminology they would possess an ordering and 
naming capacity that would diffuse stimuli over a sea of diversity. 
Ultimately, they could produce a sign code whereby the stars of 
Ursa became a team of oxen, and so on. 

It is now known that astrology has provided man with his con¬ 
tinuing lingua franca through the centuries. But it is essential to 
recognize that, in the beginning, astrology presupposed an astron¬ 
omy. Through the interplay of these two heavenly concepts, the 
common elements of preliterate knowledge were caught up in a 
bizarre bestiary whose taxonomy has disappeared. With the rem¬ 
nants of the system scattered all over the world, abandoned to the 
drift of cultures and languages, it is immensely difficult to identify 
the original themes that have undergone so many sea-changes. 

The language of the Vedas, for instance, which transposes a 
dazzling wealth of metaphysics into the discourse of hymns, is as 
remote from all other aspects of mythical thought as the stars of 





Hamlet’s Mill • 346 

Ursa themselves are from the verses which, as Masters, the Vedas 
suppose those stars to have written. In these verses, the notion of 
the way to transcendence and the absurdity and wild luxuriance of 
the imagery are certain to confound the Western mind and lead it 
far away from the subject of astronomical origins into a mystical 
dialectic. 

And yet the original life of thought, born of the same seeds as the 
Vedas, worked its way in darkness, sent its roots and tendrils 
through the deep, until the living plant emerged in the light under 
different skies. Half a world away it became possible to rediscover 
a similar voyage of the mind which contained not a single linguistic 
clue that a philologist could endorse. From the very faintest of 
hints, the ladder of thought leading back to proto-Pythagorean 
imagery was revealed to the preternaturally perceptive minds of 
Kircher and Dupuis. The inevitable process became discernible, 
going from astronomical phenomena to what might be beyond 
them. Finally perhaps, as Proclus suggested, the sequence leads from 
words to numbers, and then even beyond the idea of number to a 
world where number itself has ceased to exist and there are only 
thought forms thinking themselves. With this progression, the as¬ 
censional power of the archaic mind, supported by numbers, has re¬ 
established the link between two utterly separate worlds. 

The nature of this unknown world of abstract form can also be 
suggested by way of musical symbols, as was attempted earlier. 
Bach’s Art of the Fugue was never completed. Its existing symme¬ 
tries serve only as a hint of what it might have been, and the work 
is not even as Bach left it. The engraved plates were lost and partly 
destroyed. Then, collected once more, they were placed in approxi¬ 
mate order. Even so, looking at the creation as it now is, one is 
compelled to believe that there was a time when the plan as a whole 
lived in Bach’s mind. 

In the same way, the strange hologram of archaic cosmology 
must have existed as a conceived plan, achieved at least in certain 
minds, even as late as the Sumerian period when writing was still a 
jealously guarded monopoly of the scribal class. Such a mind may 
have belonged to a keeper of records, but not of the living word,

still less of the living thought. Most of the plan was never recorded. 
Bits of it reach us in unusual, hesitant form, barely indicated, as in 
the wisdom and sketches of Griaule’s teacher, Ogotemmeli, the 
blind centenarian sage. In the magic drawings of Lascaux, or in 
American Indian tales, one perceives a mysterious understanding 
between men and other living creatures which bespeaks relation¬ 
ships beyond our imagination, infinitely remote from our analytical 
capacity. 

“From now on,” said Father Sun, grieving over Phaethon, his 
fallen child, “you shall be Mink.” What meaning can this have for 
us? For such an understanding between men and men, and other 
living creatures too, we would need the kind of help King Arthur 
had at hand: “Gwryr Interpreter of Tongues, it is meet that thou 
escort us on this quest. All tongues hast thou, and then canst speak 
all languages of men, with some of the birds and beasts.” This abil¬ 
ity was also attributed to Merlin and Gwyon, those masters of 
cosmological wisdom whose names resound through the legends 
of the Middle Ages. In general, all fabulous communication was 
conceived as having such a range, not merely the Aesopian fable 
with its flat, all-too-worldly wisdom. 

Much of this book has been peopled with the inhabitants of a 
Star Menagerie of profoundly meaningful animal characters. The 
forms of animal life have varied from the Fishes who turned into 
hairy Twins to the remarkable succession of doglike creatures 
occurring around the world from Ireland to Yucatan. All of these 
animals have been of great significance, and each was invested with 
key functions in cosmological myth. 

It would be possible, for example, to prepare a most informative 
edition of the Romance of Reynard Fox illustrated entirely with 
reproductions from Egyptian and Mesopotamian ritual documents. 
For it is likely that these documents represent the last form of inter¬ 
national initiatic language, intended to be misunderstood alike by 
suspicious authorities and the ignorant crowd. In any case, the 
language forms an excellent defense against the kind of misuse 
which Plato speaks about with surprising earnestness in Phaedms 
(274D-275B). At the point in question, Thot/Hermes is feeling 





I Iaailet’s Mill • 348 


very proud of himself for having invented letters, and he claims 
that the alphabet will make the Egyptians wiser and improve their 
memory. Plato has the god Thamus, “king of all Egypt,” speak to 
him: 

“Most ingenious Theuth,” said the god and king Thamus, “one man 
has the ability to beget arts, but the ability to judge of their useful¬ 
ness or harmfulness to their users belongs to another; and now you, 
who are the father of letters, have been led by your affection to 
ascribe to them a power the opposite of that which they really pos¬ 
sess. For this invention will produce forgetfulness in the minds of 
those who learn to use it, because they will not practise their memory. 
Their trust in writing, produced by external characters which are 
no part of themselves, will discourage the use of their own memory 
within them. You have invented an elixir not of memory, but of re¬ 
minding; and you offer your pupils the appearance of wisdom, not 
true wisdom, for they will read many things without instruction and 
will therefore seem to know many things, when they are for the most 
part ignorant and hard to get along with, since they are not wise, but 
only appear wise.” 1 

Now that Plato’s apprehensions have become fact, there is noth¬ 
ing left of the ancient knowledge except the relics, fragments and 
allusions that have survived the steep attrition of the ages. Part of 
the lost treasure may be recovered through archaeology; some of it 
—Mayan astronomy, for instance—may be reconstructed through 
sheer mathematical ingenuity; but the system as a whole may lie 
beyond all conjecture, because the creating, ordering minds that 
made it have vanished forever. 

1 Translation by H. N. Fowler, LCL. The Jowett translation reads: “The specific 
which you have discovered is an aid not to memory but to reminiscence, and you 
give your disciples not truth, but only the semblance of truth” (oukoun mnemes all’ 
hypomneseos pharmakon heures; sophias de tois mathetais doxan, ouk aletheian 
porizeis).

• Conclusion 


L’Envoi 

From harmony, from heavenly harmony, 

This universal frame began: 

When nature underneath a heap 
Of jarring atoms lay, 

And could not heave her head, 

The tuneful voice was heard from high, 

“Arise, ye more than dead!” 

Then cold, and hot, and moist, and dry, 

In order to their stations leap, 

And Music's power obey. 

From harmony, from heavenly harmony, 

This universal frame began: 

From harmony to harmony 
Through all the compass of the notes it ran, 
The diapason closing full in Man. . . . 

As from the power of sacred lays 
The spheres began to move, 

And sung the great Creator's praise 
To all the Blest above; 

So when the last and dreadful hour 
This crumbling pageant shall devour, 

The trumpet shall be heard on high, 

The dead shall live, the living die, 

And Music shall untune the sky!
