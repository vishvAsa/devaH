As the senior, if least deserving, of the authors, I shall open the 
narrative. 

Over many years I have searched for the point where myth and 
science join. It was clear to me for a long time that the origins of 
science had their deep roots in a particular myth, that of invariance. 
The Greeks, as early as the 7th century b.c., spoke of the quest of 
their first sages as the Problem of the One and the Many, sometimes 
describing the wild fecundity of nature as the way in which the 
Many could be deduced from the One, sometimes seeing the Many 
as unsubstantial variations being played on the One. The oracular 
sayings of Heraclitus the Obscure do nothing but illustrate with 
shimmering paradoxes the illusory quality of “things” in flux as 
they were wrung from the central intuition of unity. Before him 
Anaximander had announced, also oracularly, that the cause of 
things being born and perishing is their mutual injustice to each 
other in the order of time, “as is meet,” he said, for they are bound 
to atone forever for their mutual injustice. This was enough to 
make of Anaximander the acknowledged father of physical science, 
for the accent is on the real “Many.” But it was true science after 
a fashion. 

Soon after, Pythagoras taught, no less oracularly, that “things 
are numbers.” Thus mathematics was born. The problem of the ori¬ 
gin of mathematics has remained with us to this day. In his high old 
age, Bertrand Russell has been driven to avow: “I have wished to 
know how the stars shine. I have tried to apprehend the Pytha¬ 
gorean power by which number holds sway above the flux. A little 
of this, but not much, I have achieved.” The answers that he found, 
very great answers, concern the nature of logical clarity, but not 
of philosophy proper. The problem of number remains to perplex 
us, and from it all of metaphysics was born. As a historian, I went 
on investigating the “gray origins” of science, far into its pre-Greek 
beginnings, and how philosophy was born of it, to go on puzzling 
us. 1 condensed it into a small book, The Origins of Scientific 
Thought. For both philosophy and science came from that foun¬ 
tainhead; and it is clear that both were children of the same myth. 1 
In a number of studies, I continued to pursue it under the name of 
“scientific rationalism”; and I tried to show that through all the 
immense developments, the “Mirror of Being” is always the object 
of true science, a metaphor which still attempts to reduce the 
Many to the One. We now make many clear distinctions, and have 
come to separate science from philosophy utterly, but what remains 
at the core is still the old myth of eternal invariance, ever more 
remotely and subtly articulated, and what lies beyond it is a multi¬ 
tude of procedures and technologies, great enough to have changed 
the face of the world and to have posed terrible questions. But they 
have not answered a single philosophical question, which is what 
myth once used to do. 

If we come to think of it, we have been living in the age of 
Astronomical Myth until yesterday. The careful and rigorous edi¬ 
fice of Ptolemy’s Almagest is only window dressing for Plato’s 
theology, disguised as elaborate science. The heavenly bodies are 
moving in “cycle and epicycle, orb in orb” of a mysterious motion 
according to the divine decree that circular motions ever more 
intricate would account for the universe. And Newton himself, 
once he had accounted for it, simply replaced the orbs with the 
understandable force of gravitation, for which he “would feign no 
hypotheses.” The hand of God was still the true motive force; 
God’s will and God’s own mathematics went on, another name for 
Aristotle’s Prime Mover. And shall we deny that Einstein’s space- 
time is nothing other than a pure pan-mathematical myth, openly 
acknowledged at last as such? 

I was at this point, lost between science and myth, when, on the 
occasion of a meeting in Frankfurt in 1959 ,1 met Dr. von Dechend, 

1 The Pythagorean problem is at the core of my Origins. My efforts came even¬ 
tually to fruition in my Prologue to Parmenides of 1964 (reprinted in Reflections 
on Men and Ideas [1968], p. 80). 

one of the last pupils of the great Frobenius, whom I had known; 
and with her I recalled his favorite saying: “What the hell should I 
care for my silly notions of yesterday?” We were friends from the 
start. She was then Assistant to the Chair of the History of Science, 
but she had pursued her lonely way into cultural ethnology, starting 
in West Africa on the tracks of her “Chef,” which were being 
opened up again at the time by that splendid French ethnologist, 
the late Marcel Griaule. She too had a sense that the essence of myth 
should be sought somewhere in Plato rather than in psychology, 
but as yet she had no clue. 

By the time of our meeting she had shifted her attention to Poly¬ 
nesia, and soon she hit pay dirt. As she looked into the archaeologi¬ 
cal remains on many islands, a clue was given to her. The moment 
of grace came when, on looking (on a map) at two little islands, 
mere flyspecks on the waters of the Pacific, she found that a strange 
accumulation of vmraes or cult places could be explained only one 
way: they, and only they, were both exactly sited on two neat 
celestial coordinates: the Tropics of Cancer and of Capricorn. 

Now let Dechend take over the narrative: 

“To start from sheer opposition to ruling opinions is not likely to 
lead to sensible insight, at least so we think. But anyhow, I did not 
start from there, although there is no denying that my growing 
wrath about the current interpretations (based upon discouraging 
translations) was a helpful spur now and then. In fact, there was 
nothing that could be called a ‘start,’ least of all the intention to 
explore the astronomical nature of myth. To the contrary, on my 
side, having come from ethnology to the history of science, there 
existed ‘in the beginning’ only the firm decision never to become 
involved in astronomical matters, under any condition. In order to 
keep safely away from this frightening field, my subject of inquiry 
was meant to be the mythical figure of the craftsman god, the 
Demiurge in his many aspects (Hephaistos, Tvashtri, Wayland the 
Smith, Goibniu, Ilmarinen, Ptah, Khnum, Kothar-wa-Hasis, Enki/ 
Ea, Tane, Viracocha, etc.). Not even a whiff of suspicion came 
to me during the investigation of Mesopotamian myths—of all cul¬ 
tures!—everything looked so very terrestrial, though slightly pe¬ 
culiar. It was after having spent more than a year over at least 
10,000 pages of Polynesian myths—collected in the 19th century 
(there are many more pages available than these)—that the anni¬ 
hilating recognition of our complete ignorance came down upon me 
like a sledge hammer: there was no single sentence that could be 
understood. But then, if anybody was entitled to be taken seriously, 
it had to be the Polynesians guiding their ships securely over the 
largest ocean of our globe, navigators to whom our much praised 
discoverers from Magellan to Captain Cook confided the steering 
of their ships more than once. Thus, the fault had to rest with us, 
not with Polynesian myth. Still, I did not then ‘try astronomy for a 
change’—there njoas a strict determination on my part to avoid this 
field. I looked into the archaeological remains of the many islands, 
and there a clue was given to me (to call it being struck by light¬ 
ning would be more correct) which I duly followed up, and then 
there was no salvation anymore: astronomy could not be escaped. 
First it was still ‘simple’ geometry—the orbit of the sun, the Trop¬ 
ics, the seasons—and the adventures of gods and heroes did not make 
much more sense even then. Maybe one should count , for a change? 
What could it mean, when a hero was on his way slightly more 
than two years, ‘returning’ at intervals, ‘falling into space,’ coming 
off the ‘right’ router There remained, indeed, not many possible 
solutions: it had to be planets (in the particular case of Aukele-nui- 
a-iku, Mars). If so, planets had to be constitutive members of every 
mythical personnel; the Polynesians did not invent this trait by 
themselves.” 

This text of Professor von Dechend, in its intellectual freedom 
and audacity, bears the stamp of her inheritance from the heroic 
and innocent and cosmopolitan age of German science around the 
eighteen-thirties. Its heroes, Justus von Liebig and Friedrich Woeh- 
ler, were the objects of her work done before 1953. Another of 
those virtues, scornful indignation, will come to the fore in the 
appendices, which are so largely the product of her efforts. 

Now I resume: 

Years before, I had once looked at Dupuis’ UOrigme de tons les 
cultes, lost in the stacks of Widener Library, never again consulted. 
It was a book in the 18th-century style, dated “An III de la Repu- 
blique.” The title was enough to make one distrustful—one of those 
“enthusiastic” titles which abounded in the 18th century and prom¬ 
ised far too much. How could it explain the Egyptian system, I 
thought, since hieroglyphics had not yet been deciphered? (Atha¬ 
nasius Kircher was later to show us how it was done out of Coptic 
tradition.) I had dropped the forbidding tome, only jotting down 
a sentence: “Le mythe est ne de la science; la science seule l’expli- 
quera.” I had the answer there, but I was not ready to understand. 

This time I was able to grasp the idea at a glance, because I was 
ready for it. Many, many years before, I had questioned myself, in 
a note, about the meaning of fact in the crude empirical sense, as 
applied to the ancients. It represents, I thought, not the intellectual 
surprise, not the direct wonder and astonishment, but first of all an 
immense, steady, minute attention to the seasons. What is a solstice 
or an equinox? It stands for the capacity of coherence, deduction, 
imaginative intention and reconstruction with which we could 
hardly credit our forefathers. And yet there it was. I saw. 

Mathematics was moving up to me from the depth of centuries; 
not after myth, but before it. Not armed with Greek rigor, but with 
the imagination of astrological power, with the understanding of 
astronomy. Number gave the key. Way back in time, before writ¬ 
ing was even invented, it was measures and counting that provided 
the armature, the frame on which the rich texture of real myth was 
to grow. 

Thus we had returned to the true beginnings, in the Neolithic 
Revolution. We agreed that revolution was essentially technologi¬ 
cal. The earliest social scientist, Democritus of Abdera, put it in 
one striking sentence: men’s progress was the work not of the mind 
but of the hand. His late successors have taken him too literally, 
and concentrated on artifacts. They have been unaware of the 
enormous intellectual effort involved, from metallurgy to the arts, 
but especially in astronomy. The effort of sorting out and identify¬ 
ing the only presences which totally eluded the action of our hands 
led to those pure objects of contemplation, the stars in their courses. 
The Greeks would not have misapprehended that effort: they 
called astronomy the Royal Science. The effort at organizing the 
cosmos took shape from the supernal presences, those alone which 
thought might put in control of reality, those from which all arts 
took their meaning. 

But nothing is so easy to ignore as something that does not yield 
freely to understanding. Our science of the past flowered in the 
fullness of time into philology and archaeology, as learned volumes 
on ancient philosophy have continued to pour forth, to little avail. 
A few masters of our own time have rediscovered these “prelit¬ 
erate” accomplishments. Now Dupuis, Kircher and Boll are gone 
like those archaic figures, and are equally forgotten. That is the de¬ 
vouring way of time. The iniquity of oblivion blindly scattereth her 
poppies. 

It is well known how many images of the gods have to do with 
the making of fire, and an American engineer, J. D. McGuire, dis¬ 
covered that also certain Egyptian images, until then unsuspected, 
presented deities handling a fire drill. Simple enough: fire itself was 
the link between what the gods did and what man could do. But 
from there, the mind had once been able to move on to prodigious 
feats of intellect. That world of the mind was fully worthy of those 
Newtons and Einsteins long forgotten—those masters, as d’Alem¬ 
bert put it, of whom we know nothing, and to whom we owe 
everything. 

We had the idea. It was simple and clear. But we realized that we 
would run into formidable difficulties, both from the point of view 
of modern, current scholarship and from the no less unfamiliar ap¬ 
proach needed for method. I called it playfully, for short, “the 
cat on the keyboard,” for reasons that will appear presently. For 
how can one catch time on the wing? And yet the flow of time, 
the time of music, was of the essence, inescapable, baffling to the 
systematic mind. I searched at length for an inductive way of pre¬ 
sentation. It was like piling Pelion upon Ossa. And yet this was the 
least of our difficulties. For we also had to face a wall, a veritable 
Berlin Wall, made of indifference, ignorance, and hostility. Hum¬ 
boldt, that wise master, said it long ago: First, people will deny 
a thing; then they will belittle it; then they will decide that it 
had been known long ago. Could we embark upon an enormous 
task of detailed scholarship on the basis of this more than dubious 
prospect? But our own task was set: to rescue those intellects of 
the past, distant and recent, from oblivion. “Thus saith the Lord 
God: ‘Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon these 
slain, that they may live.’ ” Such poor scattered bones, ossa vehe- 
menter sicca, we had to revive. 

This book reflects the gradually deepening conviction that, first 
of all, respect is due these fathers of ours. The early chapters will 
make, I think, for easy reading. Gradually, as we move above tim¬ 
berline, the reader will find himself beset by difficulties which are 
not of our making. They are the inherent difficulties of a science 
which was fundamentally reserved, beyond our conception. Most 
frustrating, we could not use our good old simple catenary logic, 
in which principles come first and deduction follows. This was not 
the way of the archaic thinkers. They thought rather in terms of 
what we might call a fugue, in which all notes cannot be constrained 
into a single melodic scale, in which one is plunged directly into the 
midst of things and must follow the temporal order created by their 
thoughts. It is, after all, in the nature of music that the notes cannot 
all be played at once. The order and sequence, the very meaning, of 
the composition will reveal themselves—with patience—in due time. 
The reader, I suggest, will have to place himself in the ancient 
“Order of Time.” 

Troilus expressed the same idea in a different image: “He that 
will have a cake out of the wheat must needs tarry the grinding.”
