Why w as my breeding ordered and prescribed 
As of a person separate to God. 

Designed for great exploits, if I must die 
Betrayed, captived. and both my eyes put out. . . 
O dark dark dark, amid the blaze of noon. 
Irrevocably dark, total eclipse 
Without all hope of day! 

O first-created beam, and thou great Word. 

“Let there be light, and light was over all" 

Why am I thus bereaved thy prime decree? 

Smson Agonistes 

T 

-L he story of Samson stands out in the Bible as a grand tissue 
of absurdities. Sunday school pupils must long have been puzzled 
about his weapon for killing Philistines. But there is much more to 
puzzle about (Judges xv): 

15. And he found a new jawbone of an ass. and put forth his hand 
and took it. and slew a thousand men therewith. 

16. And Samson said, with the jawix>ne of an ass. heaps upon heaps, 
with the jaw of an ass have I slain a thousand men. 

17. And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking, that 
he cast away the jawbone out of his hand, and called that place 
RamathleTii. 

18. And he was sore athirst, and called on the Lord, and said. Thou 
hast given this great deliverance into the hand of thy servant: and 
now shall I die for thirst, and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised? 

19. But God clave an hollow place that was in the jaw , and there 
came water thereout; and when he had drunk, his spirit came again, 
and he revived: wherefore he called the name thereof En-hakTo-re. 
which is in LeTii unto this day. 

20. And he judged Israel in the days of the Philistines tw enty' years.

The passage lias been bowdlerized in the Revised Version to 
make it more plausible, but verse 18 is an unshakable reminder that 
this was not an ordinary bone, or even “the place” of it as suggested 
recently. For that jaw is in heaven. It was the name given by the 
Babylonians to the Hyadcs, which were placed in Taurus as the 
“Jaw of the Bull.” If we remember the classic tag “the rainy 
Hyadcs” it is because Hyades meant “watery.” In the Babylonian 
creation epic, which antedates Samson, Marduk uses the Hyades as 
a boomeranglike weapon to destroy the brood of heavenly mon¬ 
sters. The whole story takes place among the gods. It is known, 
too, that Indra’s powerful weapon, Vajra, the Thunderbolt made 
of the bones of horse-headed Dadhyank, was not of this earth (see 
appendix #19). 

The story is so universal that it must be seen as spanning the 
globe. In South America, where bulls were still unknown, the 
Arawaks, the Tupi, the Quechua of Ecuador spoke of the “jaw of 
the tapir,” which was connected with the great god, Hunrakan, the 
hurricane, who certainly knows how to slay his thousands. In our 
sky, the name of the celestial Samson is Orion, the mighty hunter, 
alias Nimrod. He remains such even in China as “War Lord Tsan,” 
the huntmaster of the autumn hunt, but the Hyades are changed 
there into a net for catching birds. In Cambodia, Orion himself 
became a trap for tigers; in Borneo, tigers not being available, pigs 
have to substitute; and in Polynesia, deprived of every kind of big 
game, Orion is found in the shape of a huge snare for birds. It is this 
snare that Maui, creator-hero and trickster, used to catch the Sun- 
bird; but having captured it, he proceeded to beat it up, and with 
what?—the jawbone of Muri Ranga Whenua, his own respected 
grandmother. 

If one brings Samson—the biblical Shimshon—back to earth, he 
becomes a preposterous character, or rather, no character at all, 
except for his manic violence and his sudden passions. It comes as 
a shock, after reading that chaotic and whimsical life, to find: “And 
he judged Israel twenty years.” For if anyone was bereft of judg¬ 
ment, it was this berserker. As Frazer remarks, one doubts whether 
he particularly adorned the bench. Yet there is a mysterious im- 






167 • Samson Under Many Skies 

portance to his person. On him was piled a hoard of classic fairy 
tales, like “the man whose soul was placed elsewhere” (the ex¬ 
ternal soul), and the insistent motif of fatal betrayal by women, the 
motif of Herakles and Llew Llaw Gyffes. More than that, he is 
an incongruous montage of nonhuman functions which could no 
longer be put together intelligibly, and were crowded together 
with cinematographic haste. Even his feats as a young Herakles, tear¬ 
ing a lion apart, change over in a flash to the generation of bees 
from a carcass, recalling the time-honored bougonia of the fourth 
book of Virgil’s Georgies . 

Of the many nonsense feats there are some which take particular 
relief from the context. Samson was displeased (Judges xiv-xv) 
because the wife of his heart, a Philistine, had given away to the 
children of her people the meaning of his riddle on the lion: “Out 
of the eater came forth meat, and out of the strong came forth 
sweetness,” so that he was held to pay forfeit for his last bet. 

xiv. 19. And the Spirit of the Lord came upon him, and he went down 
to Ashkelon, and slew thirty men of them, and took their spoil, and 
gave change of garments unto them which expounded the riddle. 
And his anger was kindled, and he went up to his father’s house. 

20. But Samson’s wife was given to his companion, whom he had used 
as his friend. 

xv. 1. But it came to pass within a while after, in the time of wheat 
harvest, that Samson visited his wife with a kid; and he said, I will go 
in to my wife into the chamber. But her father would not suffer him 
to go in. 

2. And her father said, I verily thought that you hadst utterly hated 
her; therefore I gave her to your companion. Is not her younger sister 
fairer than she? Take her, I pray thee, instead of her to your com¬ 
panion. 

3. And Samson said concerning them, Now shall I be more blameless 
than the Philistines, though I do them a displeasure. 

4. And Samson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took fire¬ 
brands, and turned tail to tail, and put a firebrand in the midst be¬ 
tween two tails. 

5. And when he had set the brands on fire, he let them go into the 
standing corn of the Philistines, and burnt up both the shocks, and 
also the standing corn, with the vineyards and olives. 

6. Then the Philistines said, Who hath done this? And they an¬ 
swered, Samson, the son in law of the Timnite, because he had taken 




Hamlet’s Mill • 168 

his wife, and given her to his companion. And the Philistines came up, 
and burnt her and her father with fire. 

7. And Samson said unto them. Though ye have done this, yet will I 
be avenged of you, and after that I will cease. 

8 . And lie smote them hip and thigh with a great slaughter: and he 
went down and dwelt in the top of the rock Etam. 

Leaving the great Shimshon there sitting in the top of the rock, 
a brief interlude before he goes out again on his own wayward, 
rash and splenetic way to provoke his enemies, one is moved to 
reflection. 

To catch and corral three hundred foxes, and tie them in pairs 
by the tail, just to work off a spite, seems more the daydream of 
a juvenile delinquent or a Paul Bunyan or a “Starke Hans” than the 
feat of a warrior. It is as if Scripture had remembered that he had 
to stand out as a great hunter, but had misplaced the occasion of 
his hunts. .After all, lions are not to be found behind every hedge¬ 
row, and foxes might do, if only to annoy. But we know from Ovid 
(Fasti 4,6 31 ff.) that in April, at the feast of Ceres, foxes with burn¬ 
ing fur were chased through the Circus. This might be the real 
context. The modern “fertility rite” explanations are so futile that 
it might be more to the point to be reminded of the three hundred 
elite “dogs” that Gideon recruited for his band, and which still 
stand unexplained. One should also consider a more important occa¬ 
sion to which attention has been drawn by Felix Liebrecht: the 
“Sada-Festival,” during which animals were kindled and chased, 
burning, through the whole Iranian countryside. This, however, 
would lead back to Firdausi’s Book of Kings, and beyond that to 
the whole problem of Kynosoura, that cannot be tackled at this 
point because it calls for an examination of all that was implied by 
the starting of celestial fires. 

But the main theme of the story will appear more clearly if it is 
transposed in an utterly different narrative convention, the adven¬ 
tures of Susanowo the Japanese god. They are found in the Japanese 
Scriptures, in this case the Nihongi, compiled about the 8th century 
a.d. but going back to unknown times. They are the full equivalent 
of what the Bible was in our recent past, and even more, for “this 






169 • Samson Under Many Skies 

body of legend, folklore to us but credible history to the people of 
the archipelago, is tangled in the roots of everything Japanese.” 
The quotation is from Post Wheeler, who prepared the latest edi¬ 
tion of the Japanese mythical corpus. To quote him further: “In 
no other land do we find a people’s sacred legend so interknit with 
the individual’s daily thoughts and life. Its episodes peer at us from 
every nook and byway. The primeval myth of the slaughter of the 
Eight-Forked-Serpent by the deity Brave-Swift-Impetuous-Male, 
brother of Bright-Shiner the Sun-Goddess, is pictured on Japan’s 
paper currency. I have seen it produced au grand serieux at Tokyo’s 
Imperial Theatre, in the same week as one of Ibsen’s tragedies and a 
Viennese light opera.” 1 

Most of Hebrew mythology wears the hempen homespun of 
peasants and patriarchs from Palestine. Japanese myth bears the 
mark of an already refined perverse feudal world, back of which 
there is the baroque elegance and fantasy of late Chinese culture. 
With this premise, here is the story of the Japanese Samson, Susa- 
nowo, whose name means Brave-Swift-Impetuous-Male. No better 
set of attributes for Mars; he is also officially a god, since his sister 
Amaterasu, the sun-goddess, is still today the worshiped ancestor 
of the Imperial dynasty; the courtly precedences are neatly estab¬ 
lished. The hero need no longer masquerade as a boor from the 
tribe of Dan who raged in Ashkelon and destroyed himself in Gaza. 

Now Susanowo was banished from the sky for having thrown 
the hind part of his backward-flayed piebald stallion in the weaving 
hall of his sister Amaterasu. These sudden discourteous gestures 
seem to be part of the code: Enkidu had thus thrown the hind 
quarter of the Bull from Heaven in the face of Ishtar, but here 
there is the additional code feature (it is code) of the backward- 
flayed animal. Susanowo’s gesture caused the Sun-lady to withdraw 
in anger into a cave: the world was plunged into darkness. The 
80,000 gods assembled in the Milky Way to take counsel, and at last 
came upon a device to coax the Sun out of the cave and end the 
great blackout. It was a low-comedy trick, part of the stock-in-

trade that is used to coax Ra in Egypt, Demeter in Greece (the 
so-called Demeter Agelastos or Unlaughing Demeter) and Skadi 
in the North—obviously another code device. 2 

Now light was restored to the world, but on earth the hero-god 
moving out of the darkness had nowhere to lay his head; he wan¬ 
dered around and succeeded in killing the “Eight-Forked-Serpent,” 
thus saving a damsel. 

Afterwards he arranged “The Drawing of the Lands,” and the 
sowing of more land, giving the islands the shape which they 
have now. Finally, Brave-Swift-Impetuous-Male, having traveled 
about the limits of the sky and the earth, even to the Sky-Upright- 
Limiting-Wall, dwelt on Mount Bear-Moor and finally went to the 
Lower World, also called the Nether-Distant-Land. 

To this his place came a Jason, namely the Kami (Divine Prince) 
Great-Land-Master, looking for some helpful device against his 
brothers, “the 80 Kami” who had succeeded in killing him several 
times (Sky-Producer revived him). Before reaching the house, he 
married Susanowo’s daughter, Princess-Forward, and this Medea 
was to support him faithfully, so that he survived the different 
“stations” which Susanowo had prepared for him 3 as proper guest 
rooms: the fire, the snake-house, the centipede-and-wasp-house 
(Dostoyevsky’s Svidrigailov must have been a great seer): 

Then Brave-Swift-Impetuous-Male, having shot a humming arrow 
into the midst of a great grass-moor, sent him to fetch it, and when 
he had entered the moor, set fire to it on all sides. But when Great- 
Land-Master found no place of exit, there came a mouse which said, 
“The inside is hollowly hollow; the outside is narrowly narrow.” Even 
as it spoke thus, he trod on the spot, and falling into the hollow, hid 
himself until the fire had burned over, when the mouse brought him 
the humming arrow in its mouth, and the arrow’s feathers were 
brought in like manner by its young ones. 

2 The obscene dance of old Baubo, also called Iambe in Eleusis, parallels the 
equally unsavory comic act of Loke in the Edda . The point in all cases is that the 
deities must be made to laugh (cf. also appendix #36). 

3 For a comparison of the sequence of troublesome caves, holes, or “houses” that 
heroes of the Old World as well as of the New World have to pass through, see L. 
Frobenius, Das Zeitalter des Sonnengottes (1904), pp. 37if.

Now his wife, Princess-Forward, weeping, made preparation for the 
funeral, and her father, deeming Great-Land-Master dead, went out 
and took stand on the moor, but he found his guest standing there, 
who brought the arrow and gave it to him. Then the great Kami 
Susanowo took him into the palace and into a great-spaced room, 
where he made Great-Land-Master pick the lice from his head, 
among which were many centipedes. His wife, however, gave him 
aphananth berries and red earth, and he chewed up the berries and 
spat them out with the red earth which he held in his mouth, so that 
the great Kami, believing him to be chewing and spitting out the 
centipedes, began to feel a liking for him in his heart and fell asleep. 

Then Great-Land-Master bound Brave-Swift-Impetuous-A tale’s hair 
fast to the palace rafters, and blocking up the door with a five-hun¬ 
dred-man-lift rock, took his wife Princess-Forward on his back, 
possessed himself of the Kami’s great life-preserving sword, his bow- 
and-arrows, and his Skv-speaking lute, and fled. But the Sky-speaking 
lute smote against a tree so that the earth resounded, and the great 
Kami [Susanowo] started from sleep at the sound and pulled down 
the palace. 

While he was freeing his hair from the rafters, however, Great- 
Land-Master fled a long way; so pursuing after him to the Level- 
Pass-of-the-Land-of-Night, and gazing on him from afar, Brave- 
Swift-Impetuous-Male called out to him, saying, “With the great, 
life-preserving sword and the bow-and-arrow which you carry, pur¬ 
sue your low-born brethren till they crouch on the hill-slopes and are 
swept into the river currents! And do you, fellow! make good your 
name of Great-Land-Master, and your name of Spirit-of-the-Living- 
Land, and making my daughter Princess-Forward your chief wife, 
make strong the pillars of your palace at the foot of Mount Inquiry 
in the lowest rock bottom, and rear its crossbeams to the Plain-of-the- 
High-Sky, and dwell there!” 

Then, bearing the great sword and book, Great-Land-Master pur¬ 
sued and scattered the eighty Kami, saying, “They shall not be 
permitted within the circle of the blue fence of mountains.” He 
pursued them till they crouched on every hill-slope, he pursued them 
till they were swept into every river, and then he began to rule the 
Land. (Therefore the place where he overtook them was called Come- 
Overtake.) 4 

Later on, the “Genesis” part of the Nihongi will be shown to 
meet the requirements of archaic theory very exactly. Even inci¬ 
dents that seem like minor embellishments, the little mouse in her

burrow, arc really recurrent elements in the ancient fugue. Because 
it is necessary to deal with one theme at a time, much of the talc 
of Susauowo appears wildly arbitrary although no more so than 
that of Samson. Also the narrative is confusingly interwoven with 
other classic plots, recognizably those of Theseus and the Argo¬ 
nauts. And yet there Susanowo is, a maker of darkness at noon, 
Samson strength-in-hair, who “went away with the pin of the 
beam, and with the web,” walking off with rafters and rocks and 
gates and posts, pulling down a palace (his own, for a change), 
smiting and scattering iow-born workers of iniquity “not to be 
permitted again within the circle of the blue fence.” But the 
Nihovgi shows the ampler scheme in which the old order is 
smashed and the new foundation of an order is undertaken: “make 
strong the pillars of your palace at the foot of Mount Inquiry in 
the lowest rock-bottom, and rear its crossbeams to the Plain-of- 
thc -1 ligh Sky, and dwell there.” 

The god has not only judged and apportioned, he has also estab¬ 
lished and sowed for the future in his capacity as the new king 
of the Underworld; he has gone to sleep in his Ogygia, and ap¬ 
pointed his successor as ruler of the new age. Further, the Great- 
Land-Master had to procure something in the Ncthcr-Distant-Land 
(in Japan the dead go down there by land with countless wind¬ 
ings, whereas the whirlpool in the ocean is good only for trans¬ 
porting there the “sinful dirt”). He had been sent there to get 
“counsel” from Susanowo (who identified him at the first glance 
as: “This is the Kami Ugly-Malc-of-thc-Rccd-Plains”), he eventu¬ 
ally got it, and added to it the precious life-preserving sword which 
Susanowo had found in the tail of the Eight-Forked Dragon, and 
the “bow-and-arrows,” and his Orphic Sky-speaking lute, not to 
forget Princess-Forward. A complicated affair. But the Great- 
Land-Master undeniably plays a Jupiter role against Susanowo’s 
Mars, the more so, as his beloved Princess-Forward turns out to be 
extremely jealous. 

Now, after this Far Eastern interlude, Samson’s own tragedy can 
he seen in better focus (Judges xvi) :

19. And Delilah] made him sleep upon her knees; and she called 
for a man. and she caused him to shave ofr the seven locks of his head; 
and she began to afflict him. and his strength went from him. 

:o. And she said. The Philistines be upon thee. Samson. And he 
awoke out of his sleep, and said. I will go out as at other times before, 
and shake myself. And he wist not that the Lord was departed from 
him. 

:i. But the Philistines took him. and put out Inis eyes, and brought 
him down to Gaza, and bound him with fetters of brass; and he did 
grind in the prison house. [Appendix — 17] 

Howbeit the hair of his head began to grow again after he was 
shaven, 

: Then the lords of the Philistines gathered them together for to 

offer a great sacrifice unto Dagon their god, and to re ; oice: for they 
said. Our god hath delivered Samson our enemy into our hand. 

24. And w hen the people saw him. they praised their god: for they 
said. Our god hath delivered into our hands our enemy, and the 
destroyer of our countin', which slew many of us. 

25. And it came to pass, when their hearts were merry, that they 
said. Call for Samson, that he may make us sport. And they called for 
Samson out of the prison house; and he made them sport; and they 
set him between the pillars. 

26. And Samson said unto the lad that held him by the hand. Sutler 
me that I may feel the pillars whereupon the house standeth. that I 
may lean upon them. 

2 Now the house was full of men and women; and all the lords of 
the Philistines were there; and there were upon the roof about three 
thousand men and women, that beheld while Samson made sport. 

2$. And Samson called unto the Lord, and said. O Lord God. remem¬ 
ber me. pray thee, and strengthen me. I pray thee, only this once. O 
God. that I may be at once avenged of the Philistines for my two 
eyes. 

29. And Samson took hold of the two middle pillars upon which 
the house stood, and on which it was borne up. of the one with his 
right hand, and of the other with his left. 

;o. And Samson said. Let me die with the Philistines. And he bowed 
himself with all his might: and the house fell upon the lords, and 
upon all the people that were therein. So the dead which he slew at 
his death were more than they which he slew in his life. 

Such is the great story, and it has gone through innumerable 
variations. 

The general design of the tragedy is obviously faulty, more even 
than most Bible narratives which are superbly indifferent to such 





Hamlet’s Mill • 174 


considerations. If Samson had been bred as “a person separate to 
God,” by the care of the Lord “who sought an occasion against the 
Philistines,” he does not compare with chiefs like Joshua and 
Gideon. He remains, mythically speaking, a misguided missile. Most 
great feats of the mythistorical past would not have rated the atten¬ 
tion of news media, but Samson’s achievements make so little sense, 
even on the micro-scale of Palestine power politics, that Milton 
finds it hard to justify the ways of God to man. Certain “central” 
events like the fall of royal houses, whether in Greece or Babylon 
or Denmark, are capable of a truer and deeper reverberation. That 
is why great motifs like “darkness at noon” and “pulling down the 
edifice” combine into a larger theme, obviously cosmic, which is 
here obscured. The Nihongi is truer to this larger style. 

In the arabesque of interlaced motifs, one can mark those where 
the theme of “pulling down the structure” is in evidence. The 
powerful Maori hero Whakatau, bent on vengeance, 

laid hold of the end of the rope which had passed round the posts of 
the house, and, rushing out, pulled it with all his strength, and 
straightaway the house fell down, crushing all within it, so that the 
whole tribe perished, and Whakatau set it on fire. 5 

This is familiar. At least one such event comes down dimly from 
history. It happened to the earliest meetinghouse of the Pytha¬ 
gorean sect, and it is set down as a sober account of the outcome 
of a political conflict, but the legend of Pythagoras was so artfully 
constructed in early times out of prefabricated materials that doubt 
is allowable. The essence of true myth is to masquerade behind 
seemingly objective and everyday details borrowed from known 
circumstances. However that may be, in many other stories the 
destruction of the building is linked with a net. Saxo’s Amlethus 
does not pull down pillars; he reappears at the banquet set by the 
king for his own supposed funeral, like Great-Land-Master himself. 
He throws the knotted carpet net prepared by his mother over the 
drunken crowd and burns down the hall. In Japan the parallel does 
not go farther than that but it has its own relevance nevertheless. 
It suggests the fall of the House of Atreus. The net thrown by

175 * Samson Under Many Skies 

Clytemnestra over the king struggling in his bath cannot have come 
in by chance. But this is an uncertain lead as yet. 

The Sacred Book of the ancient Maya Quiche, the famous Popol 
Vnh (the Book of Counsel) tells of Zipacna, son of Vucub-Caquix 
(=Seven Arara). He sees 400 youths dragging a huge log that they 
want as a ridgepole for their house. Zipacna alone carries the tree 
without effort to the spot where a hole has been dug for the post 
to support the ridgepole. The youths, jealous and afraid, try to kill 
Zipacna by crushing him in the hole, but he escapes and brings 
down the house on their heads. They are removed to the sky, in a 
“group,” and the Pleiades are called after them (appendix #18). 

Then there is a true avenger-of-his-father, the Tuamotuan Ta- 
haki, who, after long travels, arrives in the dark at the house of 
the goblin band who tortured his father. He conjures upon them 
“the intense cold of Havaiki” (the other world) which puts them 
to sleep. 

Then Tahaki gathered up the net given to him by Kuhi, and carried 
it to the door of the long house. He set fire to the house. When the 
goblin myriads shouted out together “Where is the door?” Tahaki 
called out: “Here it is.” They thought it was one of their own band 
who had called out, and so they rushed headlong into the net, and 
Tahaki burned them up in the fire. 6 

What the net could be is known from the story of Kaulu. This 
adventurous hero, wanting to destroy a she-cannibal, first flew up 
to Makalii the great god, and asked for his nets, the Pleiades and the 
Hyades, into which he entangled the evil one before he burned 
down her house. 7 It is clear who was the owner of the nets up there. 
The Pleiades are in the right hand of Orion on the Farnese Globe, 8 
and they used to be called the “lagobolion” (hare net). The Hyades 
were for big game. 9 

At the end of this far-ranging exploration, it is fair now to ask, 
who could Samson have been? Clearly a god, and a planetary

Power, for such were the gods of old. As Brave-Swift-Impetuous- 
Male, as the Nazirite Strong One, he has all the countersigns that 
belong to Mars, and to none other. Clearly, while trying to draw 
the concluding episode of the investigation of Amlethus-Kronos, 
King of the Cosmic Mill, something else has come into view, the 
new and formidable personage of Mars—or Ares as the Greeks 
called him. He will come back more than once. Yet there is no 
question but that the name of Samson comes up quite spontane¬ 
ously in connection with the Sampo, the original quern. It was 
clearly and unequivocally within the Amlethus design. At this 
point, the intrusion of this new planetary Power must be recog¬ 
nized. Even Susanowo substitutes for Kronos in his very reign of 
the Underworld. It would have been desirable to present the 
Powers separately, and each in his own shape, as will be done 
farther on. But the many-threaded tale has its own rules, and this 
exemplifies an important one. There are no Powers more diverse 
than Saturn and Mars; yet this is not the only time they will appear 
as a confusing and unexplained doublet of the two. 

One of the motifs, destruction, is often associated with the Am¬ 
lethus figure. The other belongs more specifically to Mars. There 
is a peculiar blind aspect to Mars, insisted on in both Harranian 
and Mexican myths. It is even echoed in Virgil: u caeco Marte .” 
But it does not stand only for blind fury. It must be sought in the 
Nether World, which will come soon. Meanwhile, here is the first 
presentation of the double figure of Mars and Kronos. In Mexico, 
it stands out dreadfully in the grotesque forms of the Black and the 
Red Tezcatlipoca. There is a certain phase in the Great Tale, obvi¬ 
ously, in which the wrecking powers of Mars unleashed make up 
a fatal compound with the avenging implacable design of Saturn. 
Shakespeare has, with his preternatural insight, alluded to both 
when he made Hamlet warn the raging Laertes before their final 
encounter: 

Though I am not by nature rash and splenetic 

Yet there is in me something dangerous 

Which let thy wisdom fear .. .

But obviously there is more, and what emerges here lifts the veil 
of a fundamental archaic design. The real actors on the stage of 
the universe are very few, if their adventures are many. The most 
“ancient treasure”—in Aristotle’s word—that was left to us by our 
predecessors of the High and Far-Off Times was the idea that the 
gods are really stars, and that there are no others. The forces reside 
in the starry heavens, and all the stories, characters and adventures 
narrated by mythology concentrate on the active powers among 
the stars, who are the planets. A prodigious assignment it may seem 
for those few planets to account for all those stories and also to run 
the affairs of the whole universe. What, abstractly, might be for 
modern men the various motions of those pointers over the dial 
became, in times without writing, where all was entrusted to images 
and memory, the Great Game played over the aeons, a never- 
ending tale of positions and relations, starting from an assigned 
Time Zero, a complex web of encounters, drama, mating and 
conflict. 

Lucian of Samosata, that most delightful writer of antiquity, the 
inventor of modern “science fiction,” who knew how to be light 
and ironic on serious subjects without frivolity, and was fully aware 
of the “ancient treasure,” remarked once that the ludicrous story 
of Hephaistos the Lame surprising his wife Aphrodite in bed with 
Mars, and pinning down the couple with a net to exhibit their 
shame to the other gods, was not an idle fancy, but must have 
referred to a conjunction of Mars and Venus, and it is fair to add, 
a conjunction in the Pleiades.

to be constant: the constellations were seen as the setting, or the 
dominating influences, or even only the garments at the appointed

heavenly adventures.

any, that this fierce power, or momentary combination of powers,

the Hunter, brandishing the Hyades, working the Mill of the

Stars, like Talos, the bronze giant of Crete. For the feature which 
clinches the case has been named. Orion was blind, the only blind 
figure of constellation myth. He was said to have regained his sight 
eventually, as befits an eternal personage. But this is how legend 
portrays him, wading through the rushing flood of the whirlpool 
at his feet (where he will appear again), guided by the eyes of little 
Tom Thumb sitting on his shoulder, whose name, Kedalion, sug¬ 
gests a low-comedy occupation. But who are we to impose Mrs. 
Grundy on the assembly of heaven?
