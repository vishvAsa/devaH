The unbreakable fetters which  
bound down the Great Wolf   
Fenrir had been cunningly   
forged by Loki from these: the  
footfall of a cat, the roots of a  
rock, the beard of a woman, the  
breath of a fish, the spittle of a 
bird. 


The Edda 

Toute vue des choses qui n'est 
pas etrange est fausse. 

Valery 

This is meant to be only an essay. It is a first reconnaissance of a 
realm well-nigh unexplored and uncharted. From whichever way 
one enters it, one is caught in the same bewildering circular com¬ 
plexity, as in a labyrinth, for it has no deductive order in the 
abstract sense, but instead resembles an organism tightly closed in 
itself, or even better, a monumental “Art of the Fugue.” 

The figure of Hamlet as a favorable starting point came by 
chance. Many other avenues offered themselves, rich in strange 
svmbols and beckoning with great images, but the choice went to 
Hamlet because he led the mind on a truly inductive quest through 
a familiar landscape—and one which has the merit of its literary 
setting. Here is a character deeply present to our awareness, in 
whom ambiguities and uncertainties, tormented self-questioning and 
dispassionate insight give a presentiment of the modern mind. His 
personal drama was that he had to be a hero, but still try to avoid 
the role Destiny assigned him. His lucid intellect remained above 
the conflict of motives—in other words, his was and is a truly con- 
emporary consciousness. And yet this character whom the poet 
made one of us, the first unhappy intellectual, concealed a past as 
a legendary being, his features predetermined, preshaped by long¬ 
standing myth. There was a numinous aura around him, and many 
clues led up to him. But it was a surprise to find behind the mask 
an ancient and all-embracing cosmic power—the original master of 
the dreamed-of first age of the world. 

Yet in all his guises he remained strangely himself. The original 
Amlodhi,* as his name was in Icelandic legend, shows the same 
characteristics of melancholy and high intellect. He, too, is a son 
dedicated to avenge his father, a speaker of cryptic but inescapable 
truths, an elusive carrier of Fate who must yield once his mission is 
accomplished and sink once more into concealment in the depths of 
time to which he belongs: Lord of the Golden Age, the Once and 
Future King. 

This essay will follow the figure farther and farther afield, from 
the Northland to Rome, from there to Finland, Iran, and India; 
he will appear again unmistakably in Polynesian legend. Many 
other Dominations and Powers will materialize to frame him 
within the proper order. 

Amlodhi was identified, in the crude and vivid imagery of the 
Norse, by the ownership of a fabled mill which, in his own time, 
ground out peace and plenty. Later, in decaying times, it ground 
out salt; and now finally, having landed at the bottom of the sea, it 
is grinding rock and sand, creating a vast whirlpool, the Mael¬ 
strom (i.e., the grinding stream, from the verb vmla , “to grind”), 
which is supposed to be a way to the land of the dead. This imagery 
stands, as the evidence develops, for an astronomical process, the 
secular shifting of the sun through the signs of the zodiac which 
determines world-ages, each numbering thousands of years. Each 
age brings a World Era, a Twilight of the Gods. Great structures 
collapse; pillars topple which supported the great fabric; floods and 
cataclysms herald the shaping of a new world. 

\* The indulgence of specialists is asked for the form of certain transliterations 
throughout the text; for example, Amlodhi instead of Amlodi, Grotte instead of 
Grotti, etc. (Ed.) 


The image of the mill and its owner yielded elsewhere to more 
sophisticated ones, more adherent to celestial events. In Plato's pow¬ 
erful mind, the figure stood out as the Craftsman God. the Demi¬ 
urge. who shaped the heavens; but even Plato did not escape the 
idea he had inherited, of catastrophes and the periodic rebuilding 
of the world. 

Tradition will show that the measures of a new world had to be 
procured from the depths of the celestial ocean and tuned with the 
measures from above, dictated by the “Seven Sages." as they are 
often cryptically mentioned in India and elsewhere. They turn out 
to be the Seven Stars of Ursa, which are normative in all cosmo¬ 
logical alignments on the starry sphere. These dominant stars of the 
Far North are peculiarly but systematically linked with those which 
are considered the operative powers of the cosmos, that is. the 
planets as they move in different placements and configurations 
along the zodiac. The ancient Pythagoreans, in their conventional 
language, called the two Bears the Hands of Rhea (the Lady of 
Turning Heaven), and called the planets the Hounds of Per¬ 
sephone. Queen of the Underworld. Far away to the south, the 
mysterious ship Argo with its Pilot star held the depths of the past: 
and the Galaxy was the Bridge out of Time. These notions appear 
to have been common doctrine in the age before history—all over 
the belt of high civilizations around our globe. They also seem to 
have been bom of the great intellectual and technological revolu¬ 
tion of the late Neolithic period. 

The intensity and richness, the coincidence of details, in this 
cumulative thought have led to the conclusion that it all had its 
origin in the Near East. It is evident that this indicates a diffusion 
of ideas to an extent hardly countenanced by current anthropology. 
But this science, although it has dug up a marvelous wealth of de¬ 
tails. has been led by its modern evolutionary and psychological 
bent to forget about the main source of myth, which was astronomy 
—the Royal Science. This obliviousness is itself a recent turn of 
events—barely a century old. Today expert philologists tell us that 
Saturn and Jupiter are names of vague deities, subterranean or at¬ 
mospheric, superimposed on the planets at a “late" period; they 
neatly sort out folk origins and “late" derivations, all unaware that 
planetary periods, sidereal and synodic, were known and rehearsed 
in numerous ways by celebrations already traditional in archaic 
times. If a scholar has never known those periods even from elemen¬ 
tary science, he is not in the best position to recognize them when 
they come up in his material. 

Ancient historians would have been aghast had they been told 
that obvious things were to become unnoticeable. Aristotle was 
proud to state it as known that the gods were originally stars, even 
if popular fantasy had later obscured this truth. Little as he believed 
in progress, he felt this much had been secured for the future. He 
could not guess that W. D. Ross, his modern editor, would conde¬ 
scendingly annotate: “This is historically untrue.” Yet we know 
that Saturday and Sabbath had to do with Saturn, just as Wednes¬ 
day and Mercredi had to do with Mercury. Such names are as old 
as time; as old, certainly, as the planetary heptagram of the Har- 
ranians. They go back far before Professor Ross’ Greek philology. 
The inquiries of great and meticulous scholars such as Ideler, Lep- 
sius, Chwolson, Boll and, to go farther back, of Athanasius Kircher 
and Petavius, had they only been read carefully, and noted, would 
have taught several relevant lessons to the historians of culture, but 
interest shifted to other goals, as can be seen from current anthro¬ 
pology, which has built up its own idea of the “primitive” and what 
came after. 

One still reads in that most unscientific of records, the Bible, that 
God disposed all things by number, weight and measure; ancient 
Chinese texts say that “the calendar and the pitch pipes have such 
a close fit, that you could not slip a hair between them.” People read 
it, and think nothing of it. Yet such hints might reveal a world of 
vast and firmly established complexity, infinitely different from 
ours. But the experts now are benighted by the current folk fantasy, 
which is the belief that they are beyond all this—critics without 
nonsense and extremely wise. 

In 1959 I wrote: 

The dust of centuries had settled upon the remains of this great 
world-wide archaic construction when the Greeks came upon the 
scene. Yet something of it survived in traditional rites, in myths and 
fairy tales no longer understood. Taken verbally, it matured the 
bloody cults intended to procure fertility, based on the belief in a 
dark universal force of an ambivalent nature, which seems now to 
monopolize our interest. Yet its original themes could flash out again, 
preserved almost intact, in the later thought of the Pythagoreans and 
of Plato. 

But they are tantalizing fragments of a lost whole. They make one 
think of those “mist landscapes” of which Chinese painters are mas¬ 
ters, which show here a rock, here a gable, there the tip of a tree, and 
leave the rest to imagination. Even when the code shall have yielded, 
when the techniques shall be known, we cannot expect to gauge the 
thought of those remote ancestors of ours, wrapped as it is in its 
symbols. 

Their words are no more heard again 
Through lapse of many ages . .. 

We think we have now broken part of that code. The thought 
behind these constructions of the high and far-off times is also lofty, 
even if its forms are strange. The theory about “how the world 
began” seems to involve the breaking asunder of a harmony, a kind 
of cosmogonic “original sin” whereby the circle of the ecliptic 
(with the zodiac) was tilted up at an angle with respect to the 
equator, and the cycles of change came into being. 

This is not to suggest that this archaic cosmology will show any 
great physical discoveries, although it required prodigious feats of 
concentration and computing. What it did was to mark out the 
unity of the universe, and of man’s mind, reaching out to its farthest 
limits. Truly, man is doing the same today. 

Einstein said: “What is inconceivable about the universe, is that 
it should be at all conceivable.” Man is not giving up. When he 
discovers remote galaxies by the million, and then those quasi-stellar 
radio sources billions of light-years away which confound his specu¬ 
lation, he is happy that he can reach out to those depths. But he 
pays a terrible price for his achievement. The science of astro¬ 
physics reaches out on a grander and grander scale without losing its 
footing. Man as man cannot do this. In the depths of space he loses 
himself and all notion of his significance. He is unable to fit himself 
into the concepts of today’s astrophysics short of schizophrenia. 
Modern man is facing the nonconceivable. Archaic man, however, 
kept a firm grip on the conceivable by framing within his cosmos 
an order of time and an eschatology that made sense to him and 
reserved a fate for his soul. Yet it was a prodigiously vast theory, 
with no concessions to merely human sentiments. It, too, dilated 
the mind beyond the bearable, although without destroying man’s 
role in the cosmos. It was a ruthless metaphysics. 

Not a forgiving universe, not a world of mercy. That surely not. 
Inexorable as the stars in their courses, miserationis parcissimae, the 
Romans used to say. Yet it was a world somehow not unmindful of 
man, one in which there was an accepted place for everything, 
rightfully and not only statistically, where no sparrow could fall 
unnoted, and where even what was rejected through its own error 
would not go down to eternal perdition; for the order of Number 
and Time was a total order preserving all, of which all were mem¬ 
bers, gods and men and animals, trees and crystals and even absurd 
errant stars, all subject to law and measure. 

This is what Plato knew, who could still speak the language of 
archaic myth. He made myth consonant with his thought, as he 
built the first modern philosophy. We have trusted his clues as 
landmarks even on occasions when he professes to speak “not quite 
seriously.” He gave us a first rule of thumb; he knew what he was 
talking about. 

Behind Plato there stands the imposing body of doctrine attrib¬ 
uted to Pythagoras, some of its formulation uncouth, but rich with 
the prodigious content of early mathematics, pregnant with a sci¬ 
ence and a metaphysics that were to flower in Plato’s time. From it 
come such words as “theorem,” “theory,” and “philosophy.” This 
in its turn rests on what might be called a proto-Pythagorean phase, 
spread all over the East but with a focus in Susa. And then there 
was something else again, the stark numerical computing of Baby¬ 
lon. From it all came that strange principle: “Things are numbers.” 

Once having grasped a thread going back in time, then the test 
of later doctrines with their own historical developments lies in 
their congruence with tradition preserved intact even if half under¬ 
stood. For there are seeds which propagate themselves along the 
jetstream of time. 

And universality is in itself a test when coupled with a firm de¬ 
sign. When something found, say. in China turns up also in Baby¬ 
lonian astrological texts, then it must be assumed to be relevant, for 
it reveals a complex of uncommon images which nobody could 
claim had risen independently by spontaneous generation. 

Take the origin of music. Orpheus and his harrowing death may 
be a poetic creation born in more than one instance in diverse 
places. But when characters who do not play the lyre but blow 
pipes get themselves flayed alive for various absurd reasons, and 
their identical end is rehearsed on several continents, then we feel 
we have got hold of something, for such stories cannot be linked by 
internal sequence. And when the Pied Piper turns up both in the 
medieval German myth of Hamelin and in Mexico long before 
Columbus, and is linked in both places with certain attributes like 
the color red. it can hardly be a coincidence. Generally, there is 
little that finds its way into music by chance. 

Again, when one finds numbers like 108, or 9 X 13. reappearing 
under several multiples in the Vedas, in the temples of Angkor, in 
Babylon, in Heraclitus' dark utterances, and also in the Norse Val¬ 
halla. it is not accident. 

There is one way of checking signals thus scattered in early data, 
in lore, fables and sacred texts. What we have used for sources may 
seem strange and disparate, but the sifting was considered, and it 
had its reasons. Those reasons will be given later in the chapter 
on method. I might call it comparative morphology. The reservoir 
of myth and fable is great, but there are morphological ‘'markers - ' 
for what is not mere storytelling of the kind that comes naturally. 
There is also wonderfully preserved archaic material in “secondary" 
primitives, like American Indians and West Africans. Then there 
are courtly stories and annals of dynasties which look like novels: 
the Feng Sken Yen I. the Japanese Xibongi. the Hawaiian Kuvru- 
iipo. These are not merely fantasy-ridden fables. 

In hard and perilous ages, what information should a well-bom 
man entrust to his eldest son? Lines of descent surely, but what else? 
The memory of an ancient nobility is the means of preserving the 
arcana imperii, the arcana legis and the arcana mundi, just as it was 
in ancient Rome. This is the wisdom of a ruling class. The Poly¬ 
nesian chants taught in the severely restricted Whare-'wananga were 
mostly astronomy. That is what a liberal education meant then. 

Sacred texts are another great source. In our age of print one is 
tempted to dismiss these as religious excursions into homiletics, but 
originally they represented a great concentration of attention on 
material which had been distilled for relevancy through a long pe¬ 
riod of time and which was considered worthy of being committed 
to memory generation after generation. The tradition of Celtic 
Druidism was delivered not only in songs, but also in tree-lore 
which was much like a code. And in the East, out of complicated 
games based on astronomy, there developed a kind of shorthand 
which became the alphabet. 

As we follow the clues—stars, numbers, colors, plants, forms, 
verse, music, structures—a huge framework of connections is re¬ 
vealed at many levels. One is inside an echoing manifold where 
everything responds and everything has a place and a time assigned 
to it. This is a true edifice, something like a mathematical matrix, a 
World-Image that fits the many levels, and all of it kept in order 
by strict measure. It is measure that provides the countercheck, for 
there is much that can be identified and redisposed from rules like 
the old Chinese saying about the pitch pipes and the calendar. 
When we speak of measures, it is always some form of Time that 
provides them, starting from two basic ones, the solar year and the 
octave, and going down from there in many periods and intervals, 
to actual weights and sizes. What modern man attempted in the 
merely conventional metric system has archaic precedents of great 
complexity. Down the centuries there comes an echo of Al-Biruni’s 
wondering a thousand years ago, when that prince of scientists dis¬ 
covered that the Indians, by then miserable astronomers, calculated 
aspects and events by means of stars—and were not able to show 
him any one star that he asked for. Stars had become items for them, 
as they were to become again for Leverrier and Adams, who never 
troubled to look at Neptune in their life although they had com¬ 
puted and discovered it in 1847. The Mayas and the Aztecs in their 
unending calculations seem to have had similar attitudes. The con¬ 
nections were what counted. Ultimately so it was in the archaic 
universe, where all things were signs and signatures of each other, 
inscribed in the hologram, to be divined subtly. And Number 
dominated them all (appendix — i). 

This ancient world moves a little closer if one recalls two great 
transitional figures who were simultaneously archaic and modem in 
their habits of thought. The first is Johannes Kepler, who was of 
the old order in his unremitting calculations and his passionate de¬ 
votion to the dream of rediscovering the ‘'Harmony of the Spheres." 
But he was a man of his own time, and also of ours, when this dream 
began to prefigure the polyphony that led up to Bach. In somewhat 
the same way, our strictly scientific world view has its counterpart 
in what John Hollander, the historian of music, has described as 
"The Untuning of the Sky.” The second transitional figure is no 
less a man than Sir Isaac Newton, the very inceptor of the rigor¬ 
ously scientific view. There is no real paradox in mentioning New¬ 
ton in this connection. John Maynard Keynes, who knew Newton 
as well as many of our time, said of him: 

Newton was not the first of the Age of Reason. He was the last of the 
magicians, the last of the Babylonians and Sumerians, the last great 
mind which looked out on the visible and intellectual world with the 
same eyes as those who began to build our intellectual world rather 
less than 10,000 years ago . . . Why do I call him a magician? Because 
he looked on the whole universe and all that is in it as a riddle , as a 
secret which could be read by applying pure thought to certain evi¬ 
dence, certain mystic clues which God had laid about the world to 
allow a sort of philosopher's treasure hunt to the esoteric brother¬ 
hood. He believed that these clues were to be found partly in the 
evidence of the heavens and in the constitution of elements (and that 
is what gives the false suggestion of his being an experimental natural 
philosopher), but also partly in certain papers and traditions handed 
down by the brethren in an unbroken chain back to the original 
cryptic revelation in Babylonia. He regarded the universe as a crypto¬ 
gram set by the Almighty—just as he himself wrapt the discovery of 
the calculus in a cryptogram when he communicated with Leibniz. 
By pure thought, by concentration of mind, the riddle, he believed, 
would be revealed to the initiate . 1

Lord Keynes’ appraisal, written ca. 1942, remains both uncon¬ 
ventional and profound. He knew, we all know, that Newton 
failed. Newton was led astray by his dour sectarian preconceptions. 
But his undertaking was truly in the archaic spirit, as it begins to 
appear now after two centuries of scholarly search into many cul¬ 
tures of which he could have had no idea. To the few clues he 
found with rigorous method, a vast number have been added. Still, 
the wonder remains, the same that was expressed by his great 
predecessor Galileo: 

But of all other stupendous inventions, what sublimity of mind must 
have been his who conceived how to communicate his most secret 
thoughts to any other person, though very far distant either in time 
or place, speaking with those who are in the Indies, speaking to those 
who are not yet bom, nor shall be this thousand or ten thousand 
years? And with no greater difficulty than the various arrangement 
of two dozen little signs upon paper? Let this be the seal of all the 
admirable inventions of man. 

Way back in the 6th century a.d., Gregoire de Tours was writ¬ 
ing: “The mind has lost its cutting edge, we hardly understand the 
Ancients.” So much more today, despite our wallowing in mathe¬ 
matics for the million and in sophisticated technology. 

It is undeniable that, notwithstanding our Classics Departments’ 
labors, the wilting away of classical studies, the abandonment of 
any living familiarity with Greek and Latin has cut the ovipha- 
loessa, the umbilical cord which connected our culture—at least at 
its top level—with Greece, in the same manner in which men of the 
Pythagorean and Orphic tradition were tied up through Plato and 
a few others with the most ancient Near East. It is beginning to 
appear that this destruction is leading into a very up-to-date Middle 
Ages, much worse than the first. People will sneer: ‘‘Stop the 
World, I want to get off.” It cannot be changed, however; this is 
the way it goes when someone or other tampers with the reserved 
knowledge that science is, and was meant to represent. 

But, as Goethe said at the very onset of the Progressive Age, 
“Noch ist es Tag, da riihre sich der Mann! Die Nacht tritt ein, 
wo niemand wirken kann.” (“It is still day, let men get up and 
going—the night creeps in, when there is nothing doing.”) There 
might come once more some kind of “Renaissance” out of the 
hopelessly condemned and trampled past, when certain ideas come 
to life again, and we should not deprive our grandchildren of a last 
chance at the heritage of the highest and farthest-off times. And if, 
as looks infinitely probable, even that last chance is passed up in 
the turmoil of progress, why then one can still think with Poli- 
ziano, who was himself a master humanist, that there will be men 
whose minds find a refuge in poetry and art and the holy tradition 
“which alone make men free from death and turn them to eternity, 
so long as the stars will go on, still shining over a world made for¬ 
ever silent.” Right now, there is still left some daylight in which to 
undertake this first quick reconnaissance. It will necessarily leave 
out great and significant areas of material, but even so, it will in¬ 
vestigate many unexpected byways and crannies of the past.
