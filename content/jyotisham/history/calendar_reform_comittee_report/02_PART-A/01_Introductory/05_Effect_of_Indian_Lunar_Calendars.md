As the orthodox Indian calendar-maker still uses the old formulæ dating from 400 A.D., his calculations of the ending moments of tithis do not agree with those given by the Nautical Almanacs, which are based on modern formulæ and are verified by actual observations as shown in the following example:

Some of the Indian calendar-makers are aware of these discrepancies, and give the ending moments of tithis according to the Nautical Almanac. But all of them give the moments of beginning and ending of lunar and solar eclipses according to the Nautical Almanac, as times calculated according to the Siddhantas may be grossly inaccurate, and the mistakes would at once catch public attention and lower their prestige. In the words of one of our colleagues (Dr. Gorakh Prasad), these almanac-makers are like bicycle-riders riding without lamps, who get down from their cycles on street corners, just to avoid being caught by the Police. 



The calculations of tithis given by the Calendar Committee follow the Nautical Almanac, and are based on correct positions of the moon and the sun. 



The Committee has made another radical departure. According to conventions laid down in Dharmaśāstras, a religious festival is to be observed in a locality when the prescribed tithi is current at a particular hour of the civil day of that locality. But on the same day and hour, the tithi may vary from locality to locality and this, taken with the mistakes in calculating tithi according to ancient methods, may produce a day's difference in fixing up the dates of religious festivals. 



If the different almanac-makers calculate the tithi not according to the Nautical Almanac, but according to different Indian astronomical treatises, the moment of the tithi may differ by as much as five hours, and the same festival, say the Dussera (or Durga Pujā) may be fixed on two successive days in the same city, as happend in Calcutta in the case of Durga Pujā in 1952 and Sarasvati Puja in 1953. Which set of Pandits is to be followed by the Government in fixing up the date of holidays in such cases ? 



The Committee has taken the view that the ending moments of tithis should be given according to modern calculations (which would naturally agree with Nautical . Almanacs) and the tithi current for the Central Station ( 82.5° E. Long. and 23° 11' N. Lat.) should be the tithi for the whole of India. This is a very sensible proposition, for if we have to follow the Siddhāntic convention to the letter, then even if the calculations are given correctly, every station would have its own tithi, just as according to Relativity, every moving particle has its own time. But the Pandits are not correct in their own claims that they are following the Sāstras correctly ; for a Banaras almanac is according to Siddhāntic convention, true only for Banaras, but may on certain occasions, be incorrect for a place even a mile from Banaras. So the Siddhāntic convention was laid down in an age when there was no printing presses and no printed almanacs, but almanacs were to be fixed up and recited for every locality by local astrologers according to their own calculations. If it has still to be followed, every village should print its own almanac. In laying down the principle that the whole of India should follow the tithi calculated for a central locality, we are no more violating the Siddhāntic convention than the calculators of the Banaras or Calcutta almanacs which have currency over wide areas far away from their own city. 



In course of fixing the festivals of different states in the Reformed Calendar, it has been found that different conventions are followed in different states in the matter of fixation of the same festival. For example it may be quoted that in 1954 Janmāṣtami was observed on the 21st August in North India and on the 20th, 21st and 22nd in other parts of India. Rāmanavami was observed in Bengal on 24th March, 1953, while it was celebrated on the preceding day in upper India. The calculation of the ending moment of tithi is not the cause for such discrepancies in this case, but the difference in convention is solely responsible. We have followed all these differences of conventions in the state-wise fixation of the dates of festivals, as far as practicable. We are however of opinion that a uniform convention should be followed throughout India in this matter also. In order to explore the possibilities of such unification, it is desirable that necessary steps should be taken by the Government. The Ephemerides Committee which we have recommended may be entrusted with this work.
