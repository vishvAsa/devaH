For official purposes, India has been using the Gregorian calendar since the imposition of the British rule in 1757. As the Gregorian calendar, on account of historic reasons, has attained the status of a World Calendar, it is still being used for official purposes after the attainment of Independence. There is a proposal sponsored by India before the UNO for the intro duction of a new World Calendar for civil and administrative purposes in place of the Gregorian calendar, which is inconvenient and unscientific (vide C $2.7). 



During the period of Moslem supremacy (1200-1757), the lunar Hejira calendar had been used. both for administrative as well as for Moslem religious purposes, except for a short period (1556-1630), when on the initiative of the Emperor Akbar, its use was prohibited and a form of the Iranian solar calendar (the Jelali calendar), under the name Tarikh Ilāhi, was introduced. The Hejira calendar is now used only by the followers of Islam for fixing up the dates of their religious festivals. 



Before the advent of Moslem domination, the different states of India used a bewildering variety of calendars for civil as well as religious purposes of which a detailed account is given in C $5. The inscriptions of Indian kings from the first century A.D. to medieval times are dated according to these calendars, and it is often a headache for the Indologist to find out the starting point of the eras used in these calendars. 



Most of these calendars have gone out of use for civil purposes, but some are being still used for fixing up the dates and moments of religious festivals of communities following different schools of Hinduism and other religions having their origin in India (Buddhism, Jainism). They use different eras, different year-beginnings, and sometimes different methods of calculations based on the three Siddhantas (scientific astronomical treatises), viz., the Sūrya, the ārya, and the Brahma, all dating from ancient and medieval times.
