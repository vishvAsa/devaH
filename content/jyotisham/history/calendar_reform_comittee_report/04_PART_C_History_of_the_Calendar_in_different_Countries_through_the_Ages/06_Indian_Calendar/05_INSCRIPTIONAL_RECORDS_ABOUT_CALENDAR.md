title = "05 INSCRIPTIONAL RECORDS ABOUT CALENDAR"

+++
In this chapter, we are undertaking a critical review of the references to the calendar in ancient inscriptions, because, from the point of view of accurate history, inscriptional records are far more valuable than any references in ancient scriptures or classics, as they are contemporary documents, which have remained unaltered since the framers left them.. 

* Sometimes inscriptions and copper plate records have been found to have been forged at a latter date but such instances are rare and can not escape detection by an experienced archaeologist

References in ancient scriptures, poems, epics and other literatures are, on the other hand, very often liable to alterations, interpolations and errors in the hands of latter-day copyists and are, therefore, less trust-worthy. 

The oldest inscriptional records bearing a date ( barring those belonging to the Indus-valley period which have not been deciphered ) belong to the reign of the Emperor Asoka ( 273-236 B.C.). From these, we can make fairly accurate deductions regarding the calendar then in use. 

We take the Fifth Pillar Edict, Rāmpurvā version found at the Champaran district, Bibar. The language is Asokan Prākrt, the script is the oldest form of Brāhmi. (Sircar pp. 62-63 ) 

Fifth Pillar Edict--Rāmpurvā Version (1) Sadĩsati[a]sabhisitena($advensat-targabhiji 

ktena)--After twenty-six years had elapsed 

since coronation'. (2) Tīsu cātummā[si]su tisyam pumnamāsiyain tini 

divasāni cāvudasam pamnadasan patipadam..... ( Tiszṣu cãturmāsīṣu tiṣyāyān pūrnamāsyām, triṣu divaseṣu.caturdaśe pancadaśe pratipadi...... 'On the three cãturmāsī days, on the tiṣya full 

moon day, on the 14th, 15th and the first 

day..............." (On these and some other days, sale of fish is 

forbidden). Again, in the same : 

(3) Athami-pakhāye cãrudasāye pamnadasāye 

tisāye punāvasune... ...(Aṣgami-pakṣe, catur-daśyāin, pancadaśyān, tiṣyāyāin, 

punarvasau............); 'On the eighth pakṣa, on the 14th, and the 

15th (new moon ) on the Tiṣya and 

Punarvasu Nakṣatra days........., (On these days, he forbids the castration of 

bulls). 

From these passages, we conclude that : 1. No era was used, but .regnal years ( number of 

years elapsed since the king's coronation ) 

were used for dating. 2. The time-reckoning was by seasons, each of 

8 pakṣas. The seasons are : Grīsma (Summer): Comprising Caitra, Vaiśākha, 

Jyaiṣtha, Astrid Varṣā (Rains) : Comprising? Śrārana, Bhadra, 

Āśvina, Kārtika. Hemanta (Winter): Comprising Agrahāyana, 

Parṣa, Māgha, Phālguna. 

3. The months are not mentioned by name, except 

in one case where the month of Māgha is mentioned. They are purṇimānta, i.e., they started after full moon and ended in full moon. This is not expressly mentioned but can be inferred from the fact that the 14th, the 15th (Pañicadaßi) and the Pratipada, i.e., the first tithi are enjoined to be the days on which certain actions are forbidden. These must be the three days of invisibility of the moon, the 14th being before new moon, the 15th the new moon, and the first, the day after new moon, which were observed as unsuitable for 

many particular performances. 4. The day reckoning was by the tithi (lunar day), 

but the word tithi is probably not to be taken in the sense of the present Siddhāntic tithi, but in the sense of the Vedānga Jyōtiṣa tithi or the old Brahmanic tithi. In the latter system, a tithi was counted from moon-set to moon-set during the bright half, and from 

·moon-rise to moon-rise during the dark-half. 

There was the same tithi for the whole day. Prof. P. C. Sen Gupta has discussed this 

method of tithi reckoning (see p. 222 ). . 5. Two days are mentioned by the lunar asterisms 

Tiṣya (8 Cancri), and Punarvasu (6 Geminorum). As suggested one was probably his birth naksatra, the other his coronation naksatra. The days were therefore also named after the nakṣatra. This system is found in vogue in the epic Mahābhārata, e.g., in the following 

passage : Balarama, the elder brother of Krṣna, after returning from pilgrimage on the eighteenth day of the battle states : 

M. Bh., Salya Parva, Ch.34, 6 Catvāriṇsadahānyadya dve ca me niħsștasya vai Puṣyeṇa samprayāto'smi śravane punarāgataḥ.. 

Translation: It is forty-two days since I left the house. I started on the Puṣya (day) and have returned on the Śravaṇa. 

6. There is no mention of the year-beginning. 

The Tiṣya Purnamāsi, i.e., the full-moon day ending the lunar month of Pauṣa is marked 

out particularly. It appears from the records that in Asoka's time, the principles followed in framing the calendar were those given in the Vedānga Jyotiṣa. No era was used. From the inscriptions, we can make no inference about the luni-solar adjustment, but there is no doubt that the year was seasonal as given in the inscription of the Satavahanas (see next page).

No records bearing a date of the imperialdynasties following the Mauryas, viz., the Sungas, and Kanvas (186 B.C.-45 A:D.) are known. But the next imperial dynasty, the Satavahanas have left plenty of dated records. In these, the same system of date-recording by regnal years, the seasons, the pakṣas, and tithis are found. There are 8 pakṣas in a season of four months, and they were serially numbered from 1 to 8. The odd ones were Krṣṇa pakṣas, the even ones śukla paksas. 

Some examples are given below : 

(1) Nāsik Inscription of the Satavahana Emperor, Gautamiputra Sri Satakarni (Sircar, pp. 192-93). 

Data patikā Savachare 10+8 vāsapakhe 2 divase 1 

(dattā pritika Samvatsare aṣtādase 18 Varsāpakṣe 

divtiye 2 divase prathame 1). i.e. the inscription was recorded in the eighteenth year elapsed since the coronation on the first day of the second Paksa of the Varṣā season, i.e., in the lunar month of Śrāvana, on the first day after new moon (śukla pakṣa). 

There are other Satavahana inscriptions similarly dated as summarized in the table below : 

According to our calculations, the date of Gautami putra Satakarni would be about the first century A.D. We take some still later records. 

(2) Rāja Virapuruṣadatta of Nagarjunikonda (Sircar, 

pp. 220-221) Ramno Siri Virapurisadatasa Sava 6 vā pa 6 di 10 

(Rājfiah Sri Virapuruṣadattasya sainvatsare 

ṣaṣthe 6 rarṣāpakṣe ṣaṣthe 6 divase daśame 10. On the sixth year of King Sri Virapuruṣadatta on 'the 6th pakṣa of the varṣā season, on the tenth day. The sixth of varṣā pakṣa is month of Aśvina, second or light half (śukla pakṣa). - It is obvious from the above inscriptional evidences, that continuous era-recording was not used by Indian dynasts up to the time of the Satavahanas, and no ancient books, not even the Mahabhārata mentions an era. 

As no era is mentioned, it has been difficult to work out a chronology of the early Indian dynasts including the Satavahanas.

The number in the first column indicates the serial number of the inscription in Lūders' list. The last column contains dates, in an abridged form ; e.g., in 1123, we have 19, G 2-13. Here '19' is the regnal year, G denotes Griṣma or summer season, '2' following G denotes the second pakṣa, i.e., the second half of the month of Caitra, megaftituting the śukla pakṣa, and the last numeral '13' denotes the day. But it is not clear whether the day is the lunar day, i.e., the tithi or the solar day. Even if it be the tithi, it is probably not the Siddhāntic tithi, but the old Brahmaṇic or Vedanga tithi. 

The Coming of the Era to India As, we have seen in §3.5, the era reckoning had been in use in Babylon since 747 B.C., and the Seleucidean era which marked the accession to power of Seleucus at Babylon in 312 B.C., was widely current in the whole of the Middle East, both by the royalty and the public. 

But though as Asoka's Girnar inscription says that he was in diplomatic correspondence with five Greek kings of the West, including Antiochus I and II of Babylon, and the Ptolemy of Egypt, and sent Buddhist missionaries, to these countries, it is clear from his records that he continued to use the purely Indian methods of date-recording based on the Vedanga-Jyotiṣa. There is not the slightest indication that any of the Indian imperial dynasties which followed the Mauryas, viz., the Sungas and Kanvas (186 B.C.-45 A.D.), the Satavahanas ( 100 A.D.) allowed themselves to be influenced by the Graeco-Chaldean luni-solar calendar which was then in vogue in the Near East.. 

From about 180 B.C., North-Western India having Taxila as capital passed under the Bactrian Greeks. 

It is rather strange that though we have plenty of coins of the Bactrian Greeks who ruled in Afghanistan and N.W. India between 160 B.C., and 50 B.C., from which their names have been recovered, and some kind of chronology has been worked out, not a single record has yet been discovered which bears a date, except two doubtful ones. One is the coin of a certain Plato, found in the Kabul valley, which bears certain symbols which have been interpreted as 147 of the Seleucidean era, i,e., 165 B.C., Plato has been INDIAN OALENDAR

century A.D: The inscriptions are mostly in Kharoshi and later ones found on Indian soil are in Brahmi. The Kharoṣthi inscriptions are collected by Dr.Sten Konow in his monumental work Corpus Inscriptionum Indicarum, Vol. II., Part I., and are reproduced below in Groups A and B.. : Group A is identical with Konow's A (with the omission of Nos. 20-23) and contains dates from year 58 to 200. Group B, identica with Konow's B-Group, contains the inscriptions of Kuṣāna period bearing dates of years between 300 and 400. 

identified by Tarn to be a brother of Eucratidas, founder of the second Greek ruling house (175 B.C: 139 B.C:) in Bactria. But the interpretation' is doubtful. 

The second one is an inscription of the time of king Menander, the great king of the Euthydemid house who ruled over the Punjab, Sind and Rajputana about 150 B.C., on the Shinkot Steatite Casket, the only one of the Greek kings who has found a permanent place in Indian literature in the celebrated Milinda Panho, a' philosophical treatise meaning questions of king Menander. The inscription referred to mentions regnal year 5, the Indian month of Vaisakha, and the twenty-fifth day. Thus the date recording is Indian, but slightly different from the system used in Asokan or Satavahana inscriptions because the paksa is omitted. 

Our studies given in § 33, shows that a mathe matically accurate luni-solar calendar, based on astronomical knowledge, was first evolved in Seleucid Babylon between 300 B.C. to 200 B.C. by Chaldean astronomers. The features of this calendar were : 

(a) The use of the Seleucidean era for numbering years in place of the regral years. 

(b) The beginning of the year with the lunar month of Nisan which was to start on a date not later than a month of the vernal eqxinox. 

(This corresponds to the Indian month of Vaisakha later defined in Siddhāntic calendars). 

· (c) There was an alternative method of starting with the Greek month of Dios which was to begin on a đate not later than a month of the autumnal equinox. 

(This corresponds to the Indian month of Kārlika, as later defined in Siddhāntic calendars). 

(8) Luni-solar adjustment was done by the nineteen year cycle (vide § 32-34). 

This system of date-recording spread far and wide in the Near East and was adopted by other ruling dynasties, viz., the Parthians, who however used an era starting from 248 B.C. They used Macedonian months without alteration. : . It can now be shown that this system penetrated gradually into India.

BEPORT OF THE CALENDAR REFORM COMMITTEE 

The Method of Date Recording A record fully dated in Group A gives : 

The year of the era in figures and words ; though it does not give any particular designation to the era. 

The month, mostly in Sanskrit ; the day, by its ordinal number, e.g., No. 11, which means in the year 111 on the 15th day of the month of Śrāvaṇa. 

The months are all in Sanskrit, except in No. 6, in which the month is in Greek (Panemos= Āsādha). No. 6 alone of this group contains the rather mysterious phrase 'Etaye pūrvaye' which means, 'before these'. This phrase, the meaning of which is not clear, occurs in Kuṣāna (Group B) and even in Gupta inscriptions. 

This method of dating is quite different from that of the contemporary Indian dynasts, viz., the Satavahanas, which mentioned regnal years, the season, the pakṣa, and then probably the old tithi or the lunar day. But it agrees with the method followed in contemporary Parthia, which mentions the year usually in the Seleucidean era, rarely in the Arsacid era, the name of the month in Greek, and the ordinal number of the day, which ranges from 1 to 30 (see Debevoise, 1938). From No. 10, it appears that whenever Indian months were used they were Purnimanta, following the classical Indian custom. 

which is supposed to stand for Azes. But this has been disputed. 

This series starts with the year 58, if Cunningham's reading of (1) with the additional reading of the king's name 'Moasa' is accepted. But even if we reject it, the series certainly starts with the year 68 in No. 5, and goes up to 136 at fairly small intervals, then to 168, 187, 191, 200 containing names of rulers known from coins, viz., besides Maues above mentioned, Gondophernes (103 = 20 B.C.), some Kuṣana king (122 = 1 B.C.), Devaputra Kuṣāna (136=14 A.D.), Mahārāj. bhrata Jehonika (191=69 A.D.). They are held to be dated in the same era, which is usually called the Old Śaka Era, shortly called O.S.E. But up to this time, there has been no unanimity amongst scholars about the starting date of the era used in inscriptions grouped under A. 

We now take the second group of inscriptions which are those of the Kuṣānas, who ruled in North India in the second century A.D. 

· Date of records of Group A None of the inscriptions of Group A appear to be 'Royal Records' but some contain names of kings, e.g., No. 6, which mentions a Mahārājā Mahamta Moga, who is taken to be identical with a king whose coins have been found in large numbers in Gandhara. He calls himself 'Maves' in the Greek inscription on the obverse, and Moasa (i.e. of Moa) in Kharoṣthi on the reverse. The title given there usually is Maharajasa Rajatirajasa Mahantasa. It is held that King Moga was śaka leader who starting from a base in Seistan or Arachosia, invaded Gandhara through the southern route, sailed up the Indus, and ousted the Greek rulers Archebius from Taxila, Artemidorus from Puṣkalavati and Telephos from Kapsā (Bachhofer, 1936) and founded a large empire comprising parts of Afghanistan, Gandbara and the Punjab. 

He is generally held to have been a śaka, but some hold without sufficient reason that he was a Parthian. He is the firstwef Indo-Scythian kings known to numismatics. He was followed by other Indo-Scythian kings in Gandhara, who are known from wide variety of coins issued, viz., Azes I, .Azilises and Azes II. But there is no clear reference to them in these ins criptions except the word 'Ayasa' in Nos. 10 and 15,

The second group Nos. 24-36 contains Kharoṣthi inscriptions of the Kuṣāna kings after the first Kaniska. These and Kuṣāna Brahmi inscriptions mention : 

Years from 1 to 98, the kings Kaniska I from 

1 to 24, Vajheska from 24-28, Kaniska II of the 

year 41, Huviska from 33-60, 

Vasudeva from 62-98. The King's name and the titles are given in full, and in the genitive. The era is generally ascribed to the famous Kaniṣka as we have a record of his first year. 

Their method of date-recording is the same as in Group A, viz., (see No. 25.) the year of the era, the month name in Greek or Sanskrit, the ordinal number of the day, then, the phrase equivalent to asyāin pūrvāyām ( before these to but in these inscriptions, it is expressed in the form ise kṣunami or its variant, which has been interpreted by. Konow as equivalent of asyāîn or etasyām pūrvāyān in the Khotani śaka language which Konow thinks was the mother tongue of kings of the Kaniṣka group and which they use in their inscriptions. In fact kings of this group use a number of Khotani śaka words, and from their wide range of coins are known to have put in a medley of Greek, Iranian, and Indian gods including Buddha on their coins, but the names of the gods are not in their original Indian, Iranian or Greek form but'invari ably in the form used in the Khotani śaka language. 

The method of date-recording followed by the Kuṣānas, in spite of its identity with that of Group A shows some interesting variations. In the Kharoṣthi inscriptions of the Kuṣānas, the months are mostly Greek, less so in Sanskrit ( Caitra, Vaiśākha, etc. ). The days run from 1 to 30 and clearly they are not tithis but solar days. When we turn to Brahmi inscrip tions, we find that the month names are mostly seasonal : Griṣma, Varṣā, or Hemanta as in the Satava hana records. But since 4 is the maximum number attached to these, and the day numbers run from 1 to 30, the number after the season denotes a month, not a pakṣa and the damnare solar. Thus G 4 denotes the fourth month of the Grisma season, viz, Aṣādha, and not the fourth paksa as was the case with the Satavābanas, which would be the second half of 

Vaiśākha. The pakṣa is given up. 

This is a deviation from Sātavāhana method of date-recording and follows closely the Graeco-Chal dean method. Some inscriptions mention Greek months (e. g. Gorpiaios which is Āśvina or Bhādra in Sircar's No. 49, p. 146 ) others Indian lunar months (e. g. Śrāvana in No.51 ), but their number is small compared with the seasonal mode of recording months. These inscriptions give no indication as to whether the month is Pūrnimānta or Amānta. The Indian months are Pūrnimānta. 

But the Zeda inscription of year 11 ( No. 26 of Group B) mentions that the nakṣatra was Uttaraphalguni on the 20th of Āṣādha, and (35) mentions that in the year 61, the nakṣatra on the 8th day of Caitra was Pārvāṣādhā. A comparison with tables of nakṣatras shows that the months ended in full moon (Pūrnimānta). As pūrnimānta months were unknown outside India, the Kuṣānas must have yielded to Indian influence and adapted their original time-reckonings to the Indian custom; at least in their use of Indian months.. 

Historians and chronologists now almost unani mously hold that all these inscriptions of Group B are dated in the same era which is sometimes called the Kuṣāna era, which was founded by King Kaniska. This is said to be proved by the fact that the inscrip tions range from year 1, and we have phrases as in No. 25 of the Mahārāja Rājādhiraja Devaputra Kaniska, in the year 11. But a little more scrutiny shows that it is only a conventional phraseology, used in almost all Kuṣāna inscriptions, for even in as late as an inscription of year 98 of this group, we read 'of the Mahārājā Vāsudeva in the year 98'. It is therefore by no means clear that such phrases can be interpreted to mean that Kaniska started an entirely new era. In fact, from Kaniska's profuse use of Greek months and Greek gods in his inscriptions and coins, Cunningham was led to the belief that Kaniska dated his inscriptions in the Seleucidean era, with hundreds omitted, so that year 1 of Kaniska, is the year -401 of S. E. and year 90 of the Christian era. 

But it has been known for some time that the Kuṣāna ëmpire did not stop with that Vasudeva' who comes after Huviska. Dr. L. Bachhofer (1936) has proved from numismatics the existence of : 

Kaniska III, reigning apparently after Vasudeva I, Vasudeva II, reigning after Kaniṣka III. 

The kings appear to have retained full control of the whole of modern Afghanistan including Bactria which appears to have been the home land of the Kuṣānas and some parts of the Punjab, right up to Mathura. . There is yet no proof for or against the point that they retained the eastern parts, after year 98 of Kuṣāna 

232 

éra. Herzfeld had established that Vasudeva II, who appears to have come after Kaniska III about 210 A.D., was deprived of Bactria by Ardeshir I, the founder of the Sasanid dynasty of Persia. The Sasanids converted Bactria into a royal.province under the charge of the crown prince, who struck coins closely imitating those of the Kuṣānas. Vasudeva II is also mentioned in the Armenian records of Moise of Khorene, a Jewish scholar, under the name Vabsadjan, as an Indian king who tried to form a league with Armenia and other older powers against the rising imperialism of Ardeshir. Vasudeva II is also thought to have sent an embassy to China about 230 A.D *. . 

The second Sassanian king Shapur I, claims to have conquered sometime after 240 A.D. 'PSKVR', which has been identified with Puruṣapura or Peshawar, the capital of the Kuṣānas. This has also been confirmed by the French excavations at Begram (Kapisi) in Afghanistan, which was destroyed by Shapur between 242 and 250 A.D. But this probably was not a permanent occupation but a raid, as a Kuṣāna king or Shah is mentioned in the Paikuli inscription of the Sasanid king Narseb (293-302 A.D.). 

Kushana Method of Date-recording In India : 

It appears rather strange that the Kuṣana way of date-recording should suddenly come to a dead stop on Indian soil with the year 98 of Vasudeva I, and no records containing a year number exceeding 100 should be found on Indian soil. 

The mystery appears now to have been successfully solved by Mrs. Van Lohuizen de Leeuw in her book The Scythian Period (pub. 1949). She has proved that several Brahmi inscriptions in the Mathurā region bear dates from years 5 to 57 in which, following an old Indian practice, the figure for hundred hąs been omitted. Thus '5' stands for 105, '14' stands for 114 of the Kuṣāna era. The following example will suffice (vide pp. 242-43 of The Scythian Period). 

One and the same person Arya Vasula, female pupil of Arya Sangamikā, holding the important position of a religious preacher in the Jaina community, is mentioned in two Brahmi inscriptions (No. 24 and No. 70 of Lūders) bearing the year designations of 15 and 86 respectively, the date-recording being in the typical Kuṣāna style. The palaeographical evidence also shows that the inscriptions were recorded in the Kuṣāna age, though the name of the reigning monarch 

is not mentioned. Now it is clearly impossible that: the same person would 'occupy such an important. position from the year 15 to 86, a period of 71 years. L. de Leeuw therefore suggests that while 86 is the usual Kuṣāna year (reckoning from year 1, of Kaniska), '15' is really with hundred omitted and represents actually the year 115 of Kaniska, i.e., dates of the two inscriptions differ by 115-86=29 years, which is much more plausible. In other words, after the year 100 of the Kaniska era was passed, hundreds were dropped in inscriptions found near about Mathura. 

The author has sustained her ground by numerous other illustrations, and there seems to be no doubt that this is a brilliant suggestion and it can be taken as proved that in numbering years of an era, hundreds were omitted in certain parts of the Kuṣana dominion in the second century of the Kaniska era. L. de Leeuw has found such dates in no less than 7 instances bearing years 5, 12, 15, 22, 35, 50, 57 in which apparently 103 has been omitted, so that 57 really stands for 157, and if we take the Kaniska era to have started from 78 A.D., the date of the last one is A.D. 235=(157 +78). Probably the name of the reigning king was not mentioned, as he had either lost control over these regions, or as the inscriptions were religious, it was not considered necessary. The second alternative appears to be more correct. 

This is supported by the inscription on an image discovered by Dayaram Sahni in Mathurā in 1927, It mentions Māhārāja Deraputra Kaniṣka. But on palaeographic grounds, he can neither be Kaniska I (1-24) nor Kaniska II (41), but a later Kaniska, coming after Vasudeva I, and 14 is really, year 114 of the Kaniska era. We may identify him with Kaniska III of Bachhofer. 

So we come to this conclusion : 

The records of Kuṣana kings, after Kaniska I range from year 1 to 98. In the second century of -the Kaniska era, hundreds are omitted and such records have been found up.to year 157, i.e., year 235 of the Christian era. 

This raises a strong presumption that Kaniska was not the founder of the era, but he used one already in vogue, but omitted the hundreds. · Thus year 1 of Kaniska is really year 1 plus some hundred, may be 1, 2, or 3. L. de Leeuw does not expressly suggest this, though it is apparent from her reasoning that year 1 of King Kaniṣka is year 201 of the Old śaka era*. If this suggestion be correct, since the old śaka era is taken to have started in 123 B.C. (-122 A.D.) instead of in 129 B.C., as postulated by L. de Leeuw, Kaniska started reigning in ( 201 – 123 )-78 A.D. . 

* The suggestion is of Prof. M. N. Saha. 

in 

* Ghirshman thought that the Vāsudeva Kuṣāpa of these references is Visudeva I, whose last reference is year 98. He equated year 98 of Kaniska's era to year 242-250 A.D., and arrived at the - date 144 to 162 A.D. for the initial year of the Kaniska era. But the 

equation of this Visudeva with Vásudeva I is certainly wrong. This must be Vasudeva II, or may be a still lator Vibadera.

From the above review of inscriptional records and contemporary history, the following story has been reconstructed. 

(1) The. śaka era was first started in 123 B.C. when the Sakas coming from Central Asia due to the pressure of Hunas wrested Bactria from the Parthian emperors after a seven years' war. The leader was probably one 'Azes', and therefore the era was also alternately called the 'Azes' era. This Azes is not to be confounded with the two later Azes who succeeded Maues and reigned between 45 B. C. to 20 B. C. Earlier Sakas used Macedonian months and Graeco Chaldean method of date recording, prevalent throughout the whole of Near East. In Indian dominions, Indian months which were equated to Greek months were used. As their coins show, the ruling class had adopted Greek culture. 

(2) When the - Sakas spread from "Sakasthān', i.e., modern Afghanistan into contiguous parts of India, they began to be influenced by Indian culture. During the first stage, they exclusively used Greek in their coins, but later they began to use Kharoṣthi and Brahmi as well. The coins of Maues (80 B.C:---45 B.C.), Azes I, Azilises, Azes II show increasing influence of Indian culture. The southern Sakas who penetrated into Saurashtra and Malwa show Indian influence to a greater degree. . 

(3) In the first three centuries, they (Maues group, Nahapāna group and Kuṣānas) used the old śaka era omitting hundreds, and using a method of date recording which was an exact copy of the contem porary Graeco-Chaldean system prevalent throughout the Parthian empire (Macedonian months, and ordinal number of days). But they also began to use Indian months. Whenever they did it, the , month was Purnimānta, as was the custom with old Hindu dynasts (Mauryas and Satavahanas). 

(4). The classical śaka era starting from 78 A.D. is nothing but the old Śaka era, starting from 123 B.C. with 200 omitted, so that the year 1 of Kaniska is year 201 of the Old śaka era. 

The senior author has shown that Nahapjna used the old śaka bra with one hundred omitted, so that the year 46 of Nahapāna was the year 146 of the old śaka era or about 24 A.D. 

The Satavahana kings Gautamiputra Satakarni and his son Vasiṣthiputra Pulumaví, whose records are .found dated in the typical Indian fashion, reigned according to his hypothesis from about 40 A.D. to 80 A.D. From epigraphical record, Nahapana is at least separated by about 100 years from the next group of śaka rulers, viz., the Sakas of Ujjain belonging to the house of Caṣtana. 

The śaka satraps of Ujjain. We come across the records of another śaka ruling family, reigning in Ujjain. 

[Andau (Cutch) stone inscriptions of the time of Castana and Rudradaman, Sircar, p. 167].

Translation : Of king Castana, son of Jamotika and of king Rudradaman son of Jayadaman, in the year 52, on the dark half of the month of Phalguna and on 

the 2nd day.... 

This inscription mentions the year 52, the second day of the Krsna pakṣa of the month of Phālguna. 

There is no doubt that the year mentioned is that of the Baka era as now known. For this satrapal house reigned continuosly for nearly 300 years and has left a wealth of dated records. But the name of the era is not mentioned in the earlier records. They are mentioned merely as years so and so. 

The earliest authentic instance of the use of śaka era by name is supplied by the Badæmi inscription of Calikya Vallabhesvara (Pulakesin I of the Calukya dynasty), dated 465 of the śaka era (śaka- Varsanu Catus-sateṣu pañca-ṣasthi-yutesu : Epigraphia Indica XXVII, p. 8). In literature the use of the era by name appears still earlier. The Lokavibhāga of Simhasari, a Digambara Jaina work in Sanskrit is stated in a manuscript to have been completed in 80 beyond 300 (i.e. 380) of the śaka years (Ep. Ind., XXVII, p. 5). There is no doubt that the era used in the records of the western satrapal house beginning with Castana and Rudradaman have come down to the present times as the śaka Era, which is the 'Era' par excellence used by Indian astronomers for purposes of calculation. There ere 30 or more 'Eras' which have been in use in India (vide § 5*8), but none of them have been 

Śaka Era in the South-West. Besides the earlier Sakas belonging to the Maues group, and the Kuṣānas, there was another groupof śaka kings, who penetrated into the south-western part of India. The earliest representative of this group was Nahapana and his son-in-law Uṣavadata. Their records are dated in years 41 to 46 of an unknown era. They use Indian lunar honths and days (probably tathis). These Sakas ruled in Rajputana, Malwa, and northern Maharastra and were engaged in continuous warfare with the Satavahana ruler Gautamiputra Satakarni who claim to have destroyed them root and branch.

used for calendaricat calculation by the · Indian astronomers. 

Yet it is difficuit wo assign the origin of the śaka era to the western satraps. · An era can be founded only by an imperial dynasty like the Seleucids, the Parthians or the Guptas. The western satraps never claim, in their numerous records, any imperial position. They are always satisfied with the subordingte titles like Kṣatrapa (Satrap) or Maha Kṣatrapa (Great Satrap) while the imperial position is claimed by their northern contemporaries, the Kuṣānas, 

The conclusion is that the western Kṣatrapas used the old Śaka era, with 200 omitted ; so that year 1 of the present Śaka era is year 201 of the old Śaka era, i.e., (201-122)=79 A.D. . 

The gradual adoption of characteristic Indian ideas by the Sakas is shown in a record of Satrap Rudrasimha dated 103 S.E. or 181 A.D. 

[Gundā Stone Inscription of the time of Rudrasimha I, Sircar, p. 176]

• Translation : Of king Mahakṣatrapa.....of Svami Rudrasimha in the year 103 in the light half of the month of Vaiśākha on the 5th tithi and in the Robini nakṣatra muhurta,...... 

The śaka satrap Rudrasimba, reigning in 181 A.D. thus dates his inscriptions using an era (the śaka era), purely Indian months, tithes and nakṣatras. This is in full Siddhāntic style, because the characteristic features of Siddhāntic method of date recording which mention lithi and nakṣatra are first found in this inscription. The 'week day' is however not mentioned. 

This is first mentioned in an inscription of the emperor Budhagupta (484 A. D.).
