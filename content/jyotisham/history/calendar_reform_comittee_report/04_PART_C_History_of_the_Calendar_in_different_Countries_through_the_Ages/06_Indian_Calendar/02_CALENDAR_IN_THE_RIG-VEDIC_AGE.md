( -1200 B.C.) The Vedic Literature : The knowledge of the calen dar in this age can be obtained only from the Vedic literature which consists however of different strata, greatly differing in age. According to the great orientalist Max Muller four periods each presupposing the preceding can be distinguished. They are : 

(a) The Chandas and Mantras composing the Samhitās or collections of hymns, prayers, incantations, benedictions, sacrificial formulas, and litanies 

The above gives the 'Philologists' stratification of the age of the Vedic literature. About the actual age of each strata, there is great divergence of opinion, though it is admitted that the oldest in point of age are the Samhitās, then come the Brāhmaṇas and

Upaniṣads, next the Sutras or the Vedangas. Of the four Vedas, the Rg-Vedas are by common consent taken to be the earliest in age and as Winternitz remarks, though all subsequent Indian literature refers to the Rg-Vedas, they presuppose nothing extant. 

· Max Muller made a rough assignment of age to the different strata as follows on the assumption that the Brahmanic and Upaniṣadic literature predated the rise of Buddhism, and that the Sutra literature which may be synchronous with the Buddhistic literature may be dated 600 B.C. to 200 B.C. Working backwards he assigned the Brāhmanic literature to 600 B.C. to 800 B.C., the interval 800 B.C. to 1000 B.C. 

· as the period in which the collections of hymns were arranged, and 1000 B,C. to 1200 B.C, as the period of the beginning of Vedic poetry. He always regarded these periods as terminus ad quem, and in his Gifford Lectures on Physical Religion in 1889, he expressly states "that we connot hope to fix a terminus a quo. Whether the Vedic hymns were composed 1000, 1200, 2000 or 3000 years B.C., no power on earth will ever determine. * 

It is not correct therefore to say, as some people say, that Max Muller had proved that 1200-1000 B.C. is the date of the Rg-Vedas. † 

. Other authorities, Schrader, Tilak, Jacobi, and P. C. Sengupta have found much older age for Rg-Vedic Indians : in fact, even as early as 4000 B.C., for some incidents described in the Rg-Vedas.* But their arguments, being based on interpretations of vague passages assumed to refer to astronomical phenomena have not commanded general recognition. 

Let us first look at the strata within the Rg-Veda itself. The Rg-Vedas are divided into 10 Mandalas (lit. circles ) or books. Of these, the 2nd to the 8th books are ascribed to certain priestly families, e.g, the 2nd book is ascribed to Gritsamadas, the 3rd to the Visrāmitras, etc. These are agreed to be the oldest parts of the Vedas. 

The ninth book is devoted to Soma which is an intoxicating drink pressed out of a plant. The drink was dear to the Aryans and is also mystically identified with the Moon. 

The first and the tenth books are miscellaneous collections ascribed to different authors. They are taken to be the latest in age. 

The Rg-Vedas consist of 1028 hymns, containing over 40,000 lines of verses. 

The Vedas are regarded as 'Śrulis' or "revealed knowledge preserved by hearing." According to savants, they were the outpourings of the heart and mind, of ancient priestly leaders, to their gods which were mostly forces of nature, intermingled very often with secular matter. Priestly families were trained to memorize the texts and pass them on to succeding generations in ways which guaranteed their transmi ssion without error or alteration of the text. Savants are almost unanimous in their opinion that the Rg-Vedic texts which were composed in an archaic form of Sanskrit, which was not completly understood even in 500 B.C,, have come to us without change. The orthodox Indian view that they are revealed knowledge is of course not shared by scholars, both eastern and western, who point out that very often in the text of the Vedas themselves and in Anukramanis or introductions to texts, the authors of each hymn are mentioned by name and family.. 

To which locality are the Vedas to be ascribed ? 

As regards locality, they are certainly to be ascribed to parts of Afghanistan, east of the Hindukush and the Punjab. The rivers of the Punjab, the Indus and its tributaries on both sides and the now lost Sarasvatī are frequently mentioned, the Ganges only once in a later text. The authors call themselves Aryas or Aryans, in contrast to the Dāsas or Dasyus who were alien to them, and with whom they came in frequent clash. The Dasyus are now taken to be partly Indus valley people, partly aboriginals. 

The Rg-Vedas describe a highly complex society of priests, warriors, merchants and artisans, and slaves but the rigid caste system had not yet developed. There are also references to cities, but no artefacts except some pottery, have yet been discovered. which can be referred to the Rg-Vedic Aryans. 

The Rg-Vedic Aryans, it appears, were con temporaneous (if not older) with the great civilizations of Mesopotamia, both Sumerian, and later Accadian, and according to one view, some of the royal families of Asia Minor, were probably 'Vedic Aryans'. It is therefore quite probable that they had attained as high a stage of civilization as that of Egypt of the Pyramid builders (2700 BC.), or of Sumer and Accad under Sargon I. 

Let us see what information we can gather about the calendar which they must have used for no civilized community can be without a calendar. 

* For details about Vedic antiquity, see Ancient Indian Chronology by P. C. Sengupta. 

+ It appears that Max Mūller has been a bit dogmatic in his opinion. Shortly after his death the names of the Vedic gode, Indra, Varuna, Mitra and the Nāśatyas in their Rg-Vedic forms were discovered in the Hittite clay tablets discovered at Boghaz Kuei in Asia Minor. They have been assigned to about 1450 B.C. More evidences about the Vedic Aryans were discovered in the excavations in the Sarasvatī valley now being undertaken by the Archaelogical Dept. of the Govt. of India. Further, fresh evidences are expected also in the archaelogical work undertaken in Afghanistan, Iran and Central Asia.

Translation: Twelve spoke-boards: One wheel : three pavels. Who understands these? In these there are 360 sankus (rods) put in like pegs which do not get loosened". 

Further, the whole life of Vedic Aryans was centred round sacrifices to their great gods ; and sacrifices had to be carefully timed with respect to seasons, and moon's phases. In fact, some sacrifices were year-long, as Dr. Martin Haug, the great Vedic scholar remarks in his introduction (p. 46) to Aitarcya Brāhmaṇa (affiliated to the Rg-Veda). 

"The Sattras (or sacrifices) which lasted for one year, were nothing but an imitation of the sun's yearly course. They were divided into two distinct parts, each of six months of thirty days each ; in the midst of both was the Visuvān, j.l., equator, or central day, cutting the whole Sattra into two halves". 

This refers to somewhat later times than the Rg-Veda, but even during these early times, the sacrificial cult was fully developed. Let us see what references we get about the calendar from the Rg-Vedic times. 

The year is compared to a revolving wheel, whose circumference is divided into 12 parts (twelve months). They are grouped into three navels (seasons). 

Here also we have a year of 360 days, divided into 12 months, four months constituting a season, as we find in the oldest inscriptions. 

If the interpretation of the last passage is correct, we have the earliest reference to the later cãturmāsya system, or division of the year into three seasons each of four months. 

It appears from these passages that Vedic Aryans had once a year of 360 days as ancient Egyptians also had, but they discovered later that this was not the correct value either for 12 lunar months, or for a seasonal year. For the following reference shows that they used also a thirteenth month. 

Ķg-Veda, 1. 25.8 Veda māso dhỉtavrato dvādaśa prajāvataḥ 

vedāya upajāyate. Translation : Dhrtavrata ( Paruṇa ) knows the twelve months : (and) the animals created during that period; (and) he knows (the intercalary month) which is created (near the twelve months). 

This passage makes it clear that the calendar was luni-solar. But how was the adjustment made ? 

A hymn in the Rg-Veda first noted by Tilak comes to our help. 

Calendaric and Astronomical References 

in the Rig Vedas These are few, and interspersed along with other matter. This is not to be wondered at, for the hymns are addressed chiefly to the gods, Agni (sacrificial fire). Indra (the national warrior god), etc., and other references are only incidental. The direct references are found only in Books 1 and 10 which are later in age than the family books. 

Let us give the texts of a few hymns and their translations in English. 

Rg-Veda, 1.164.11 Dvada sāram nabi tajjarāya varvarti cakram 

paridyāmộtasya A putrā agne mithunāso atra sapta satāni 

vimśatisca tasthuh. Translation: The wheel (or time) having twelve spokes revolve round the heavens, but it does not wear out. Oh Agni !. 720 pairs of sons ride this (wheel). 

Here the year is likened to a wheel, having 12 spokes for months); the 720 pairs of sons are 360 days and nights. 

The interpretation commonly accepted is that the year was taken to consist of 360 days divided into 12 months, and the night and the day (following or preceding) constitute a couple. 

Rg-Veda, 1.164.48. Dvādas& pradhayascakramekam tripi nabhyāni

According to Tilak, the Kbhus are the genii of seasons. They are said to enjoy the hospitality of the sun for twelve days in the above verse. This passage, according to Tilak means the adjustment of the solar 'year with the lunar (sie., 366-354-12 days).*

Another hymn from Atharva Veda (4.11.11) states that: 'Prajapati, the lord of yearly sacrifices after finishing one year's sacrifice, prepared himself for the next year's sacrifice'. 

The sacrificial literature of India still preserves the memory of these days by ordaining that a person wishing to perform a yearly sacrifice should devote 12 days (dvādaśāna) before its commencement to the preparatory rites. 

Did the Rg-Vedic Aryans have any knowledge of the lunar zodiac, or designate the days by the lunar mansions, as we find widely prevalent during later times ? 

There is no explicit reference to this point, but words which are now used to denote the lunar mansions are found in several verses of the Rg Vedas, e.g., 

Citra (a Virginis) is mentioned in RV. 4-51-2 

Magha (α Leonis ) is mentioned in RV. 10-85-13 but in these passages the meaning of these words is not very clear. 

The following references are more explicit. 

Atharva Samhita, 14.1.13 Sūryāyā vahatuḥ prāgāt savitā yam avāspjat Maghāsu hanyante gāvah pbalganipu vyuhyate. 

Translation : The first line is identical. In the second line, the only change is Maghā for Agha, and Phalguni for Arjuni. In the lunar zodiac, Magha stands for lunar asterism No. 10, of which the chief star is α Leonis. The two Phalguni stars, Uttara Phalguni (No.12) and pūrva Phalguni (No. 11) stand for ß Leonis and & Leonis. 

This verse shows that the custom of designating the day (it means day and night) by the lunar asterism in which the moon is found in the night, which is found widely in vogue in later times, and is used even to-day for religious purposes, was in use at the time when this hymn was written. The practice therefore 

dates earlier than 1200 B.C. at least. 

Rg-Veda, 5.54. 13 Yuṣmā dattrasya Maruto vicetaso rāyaḥ gyáma rathyo vayasvataḥ na yo yucchati tiṣyo yathā divo'sme rāranta Marutah sabasriṇań. 

Translation : You wise Maruts, we would like to be disposer of the wealth conferred by you on us ; it should not deviate (from us) as Tiṣya does not deviate from the heavens. 

Here one is tempted to identify the word 'Tisya' with the lunar asterism of that name, viz., Puṣya (8 Cancri). 

The following reference is more explicit. 

Longer periods of Time : The Yuga 'Yuga' is a very common word used in Indian literature of all times to denote an integral number of years when certain astronomical events recur. It exactly corresponds to the Chaldean word 'Saros' which has gone into international vocabulary. In later Indian literature we have Yugas of all kinds the five yearly yuga, sixty yearly yuga, and Mahāyugas of 4:32 x 106 years. Was any Yuga, known in Rg-Vedic times ?' 

There is evidence that some kind of a short period yuga, probably the five yearly yuga of later times, in which the moon's phases roughly recur, and which was the chief theme of the Vedānga Jyotiṣa was known in Rg-Vedic times as the following quotation shows : 

Rg-Sainhetā, 1.158.6. . Dirghatamā māmateyo jujurvān daśame yuge apāmartham yatinām Brahmā bhavati sārathih 

Translation : Dirghatamā the son of Mamatā having grown old in the tenth yuga became the charioter of the karma which leads to semi-result. 

The most rational explanation of the word yuga here is probably the five yearly yuga of Vedānga Jyotiṣa for it is rational to expect that a man becomes old after he attains the 50th year. But there have been other explanations. 

The Seasons and the Year The most commonly used word for year in the Indian literature is Varṣa or Vatsara. The word 

Versa' is very similar to Varṣā, the rainy season, and is probably derived from it. But curiously enough, this word is not found in Rg-Vedas. But the words Śarad (Autumn), Hemanta (early Winter) etc., are very often found to denote 'seasons" and sometimes years, 

Rg-Veda, 10. 85. 13 Sūryāyā vahatuh prāgāt savitā yamavāsșjat Aghāsu hanyante gāvo'rjunyoḥ paryuhyate. 

Translation: The (dowry) of cows which was given by Savita (Sun) had already gone ahead of Surya. On the Agha-day, the cattle were slain (acc. to Sayana had departed), on the two Arjuni-days, she was led to the bridegroom's house. 

This passage occurs in the famous bridal hymn, where the Sun god (Savitr) gives away his daughter Suryā to Soma (Moon) in marriage. It says that on the Agħā-day the cows, given as bridal dowry are, driven away ; on the two Arjuni-days, the bride goes to the bridegroom's house. 

This hymn is repeated in the Atharva Samhita as follows:
