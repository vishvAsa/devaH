In addition to the Chaldeans, many other nations of antiquity, viz..the Vedic Indians, the Greeks, the Romans and the Jews and others used the luni-solar calendar, and had to make luni-solar adjustments. It will be tedious to relate how they did it, except in the case of the Vedic Indians (vide § 5). But the knowledge of the nineteen-year rule appears to have diffused to all countries by the first century of the Christian era. From this time onwards, the lunar months of different nations appear to be interchange able. This is shown in the following Table No. 4. 

We have almost complete knowledge of the luni solar calendars of the Babylonians during Seleucid times. The names of months with their normal lengths are shown in column (2) of the table.

The first Babylonian month Nisannu, started with 30 days, and other months were alternately 29 and 30 days. A normal year thus consisted of 354 days, but occasionally an extra day was added to the last month, and it became a year of 355 days. 

The effect of these intercalations was that the first month, viz., the month of **Nisannu**, never strayed for more than 30 days beyond the day of **vernal equinox**.

As the table shows, the Babylonian year might be of **354, 355, 383, or 384 days** duration, and occasionally it is said that they **extended to 385** days. It was therefore impossible to calculate the number of days between two incidents, dated according to the Chaldean calendar, unless the investigator had a table of past years showing the lengths of each individual year. Herein comes the superiority of the Egyptian system, where the number of days between two incidents, dated according to the Egyptian system, could be easily calculated. The two greatest astronomers of ancient times, **Hipparchos and Ptolemy**, therefore, **preferred** **the Egyptian system** of dating to the Chaldean or the Macedonian. 

The **Macedonian Greeks** used the months given in column (3) in their home land. When they settled in Babylon as rulers (313 B.C.), they continued to use the same months, but got them linked to Chaldean months. Their first month was **Dios**, which was the seventh month of Chaldeans. This was probably linked to the **autumnal equinox** in the same way as Nisannu was to the vernal equinox. The Macedonian year started six months earlier than the Chaldean year. 

The Macedonian months were used by the **Parthians, the early Sakas, and the Kushans** in India wihout change of name (vide § 5.5), and probably the month-lengths were also the same as in the Chaldean 19-year system. When the Sakas and Kushans began to rule in India, from first century B.C., they used the Macedonian months alternatively with the Indian months which are shown in the first column. The **first Indian season, Spring,** however, according to immemorial Indian custom, has been on **both sides of the vernal equinox (-30° to 30°),** while in the Graeco Chaldean system, the Spring started with vernal equinox (0°). The first Indian month is Caitra, the first of the spring months, and according to rules prevalent in Siddhāntic times (300 A.D.), the month was to be always on the lower side of the vernal equinox, i.e., the **beginning of lunar Caitra was to be on a date before the vernal equinox**. It may be added that the Indian lunar months mentioned here are amānta or new moon ending.
