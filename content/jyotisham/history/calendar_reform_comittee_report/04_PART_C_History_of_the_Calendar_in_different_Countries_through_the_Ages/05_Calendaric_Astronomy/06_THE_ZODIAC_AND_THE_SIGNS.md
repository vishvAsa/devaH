title = "06 THE ZODIAC AND THE SIGNS"

+++

The early astronomers must have found that the sun's path in the heavens was almost fixed, while that of the moon, and of the planets, which acquired for astrological reasons great importance from about 1200 B.C., strayed some degrees to the north and south of the ecliptic. 

In case of the moon the deviation from the ecliptic was found to be not much greater than 5°, but some of the planets strayed much more ; in the case of Venus, her perpendicular distance from the ecliptic rises sometimes as high as 80 degrees. So a belt was imagined straying about 9° north and go south of the ecliptic, in which the planets would always remain in course of their movement. This belt came to be known as the 'Zodiac.' 

The complete cycle of this belt was divided into 12. equal sectors each of 30°, and each sector called a "Sign'. The signs started with one of the points of intersection of the ecliptic and the equator, and the first sign was called 'Aries' after the constellation of stars within it. The names of the succeeding signs are given in Table No. 8 on the next page, in which : 

- The first column gives the beginning and ending of the signs, the vernal equinoctial point being taken as the origin. 
- The second column gives the international names which are in Latin with the symbols used to denote the signs. 
- The third column gives their English equivalent. 
- The fourth column gives the Greek names. They are synonimous with the international names. 
- The fifth column gives a set of alternative names for the signs given by Varahamihira. 
- The sixth column gives the Indian names. 
- The seventh column gives the Babylonian names.

It can be easily inferred from the table that the names are of Babylonian origin, but their exact significance is not always known. It has been assumed that the symbols used to denote the signs have been devised from a representation of the figure of the animal or object after which the sign has been named, for example, the mouth and horns of the Ram, the same of the Bull, and so on. 

It is seen that **Varāhamihira's alternative names** given in column (5) are simply the **Greek names corrupted** in course of transmission and as adopted for Sanskrit ; with the exception of the name for Scorpion, which is given as '**Kaurpa**'. This has phonetic analogy with the corresponding **Babylonian sign name Akrabu** for Scorpion. The purely Sanskrit names given in column (6) are all translations of Greek naines with the exceptions of : 

- (3) Twins, which become Mithuna or ‘Amorous couple', 
- (9) the Archer, which becomes the 'Bow', 
- (10) the Goat, which becomes the 'Crocodile', 
- (11) Water bearer, which becomes the 'Waterpot'. 

Some of them appear to have been **translations of Babylonian names**. The Babylonian names, as interpreted by Ginzel\* are given in the seventh column, with their meanings. +++(\* Ginzel, Handbuch der Mathematischen und Technischen Chrono logie, Vol. I, p. 84. )+++

It is thus seen that the names of the zodiacal signs are originally of **Babylonian origin**. They were taken over almost without change by the Greeks, and subsequently by the Romans, and the Hindus, from Graeco-Chaldean astrology, 

But why was such an **odd assortment of animal names** chosen for the Signs? There have been interesting **speculations**. The reader may consult Brown's Researches into the Origin of the Primilive Constellations of the Grecks, Phoenicians and Babylonians, London, 1900. 

These signs were taken up by almost all nations in the centuries before the Christian era on account of the significance attached to them by astrologers. In Greece, they were first supposed to have been introduced by the **early Greek astronomer Cleostratos**, an astronomer who observed about **532 B.C.** in the island of Tenedos off the Hellespont who introduced the designation '**Zodiac**' to describe the belt of stars about the ecliptic. The twelve 'Zodical Signs' are not known in older ritualistic Indian literature like the Brāhmaṇas. They appear to have come to India in the wake of the **Macedonian Greeks or of nations like the Sakas** who were intermediaries for trans mission of Greek culture to India. 

## Confusion in the starting point of the Zodiac 

The 'Initial Point' of the zodiac should be the **Vernal Point** or the point of intersection of the ecliptic and the equator, but as will be shown in the next section, this point is not fixed, but **moves west-ward** along the ecliptic at the rate of approximately **50" per year** (precession of the equinoxes). This motion is unidirectional, but before Newton proved it to be so in 1687 from dynamics and the law of gravitation, there was no unanimity even amongst genuine astronomers about the uni-directional nature of precessional motion, inspite of overwhelming observational evidences. 

The hesitation of the medieval astronomers in accepting precession can be easily understood. Most of them earned their livelihood by practising the Astrological Cult which was reared on the basis that the signs of the zodiac are fixed, and coincident with certain star-groups ; but this assumption crumbles to the ground if precession is accepted. But as historical records now show, though astronomers had clearly recognized that the initial point should be the point of intersection of the equator and the ecliptic, there was no unanimity even amongst ancient astronomers of different ages regarding the location of this point in the heavens, because it was not occupied by any prominent star at any epoch and the ancients were unaware of the importance of its motion (vide § 4:9).
