+++(Happily you roam the paths of the sky cloud-free yet decorated with lightning creepers created by the flash of the golden whip as the best of charioteers flicks it up. He is agitated – his progress has been hindered because his team of horses is no longer paying attention, engrossed instead in listening to the music of the vina that is formed of a line of bees swarming around the surface of a lotus pond. You are the elephant in rut who destroys the tree of ignorance, the fresh basin of water in which the creeper of the triple Vedas stands – victory!)+++

## अवसानम्
मित्राऽनुग्रह-रूपे महति व्यसनाऽऽतप-च्छिदि **च्छत्रे** ।  
श्रीशङ्करेण **घटितं** प्रीत्या **गृह्णन्तु दण्डकं** विबुधाः ॥  
+++(Let the wise gladly accept this daṇḍaka which Sri Shankar fixed upon the great umbrella – in the form of the grace of the sun – which destroys the burning heat of misfortune.)+++


## परिचयः कविकृतः
This Dandaka is modeled after the Garudadandaka of Vedantadeshika. Each of its four quarters begins with 6 short syllables (as in ज-य-ह-रि-ह-य) that is followed by 34 रगणs (i.e. triads comprising of long-short-long syllables). At the start of the दण्डक is an अनुष्टुभ् verse and at its end, an आर्या verse. The initial अनुष्टुभ् verse and the first quarter of the दण्डक allude to the poetic convention that the चक्रवाक couples, after spending a night of separation, are united with one another as the sun rises. The second quarter alludes to the blooming of lotuses with sun's rise and to the poetic convention that horses are captivated by the music of वीणा, The third quarter is based on the mythological tale of गरुड stealing the pot of nectar from heaven after vanquishing the serpents guarding it. While the day is गरुड, the sun's orb is the golden jar of nectar he seizes. The dark night is पाताललोक and the राक्षसs that are active at night are the serpents of this पाताल. The fourth quarter plays upon the कविसमय that the sun rises behind the उदयाद्रि, the rising mountain. As he rises, he melts the snowflakes clinging to the manes of lions that have just woken up from their slumber. Each of the quarter ends with a यमक, a repetition of letters similar in sound but different in meaning. Thus we have in त्रिवेदीप्रभो and तेजसा दीप्र भोः the repetition of दीप्रभो, in ध्वंसनव्याल and नव्यालवाल of नव्याल, in स्वच्छवेलातिगस्वच्छवे of स्वच्छवे and in त्रिलोकैकपूज्याय सेन्दुग्रहज्यायसे of ज्यायसे. The verse with which the composition concludes employs a श्लेष (pun) on the word दण्डक that means both a composition of the दण्डक type as well as the handle of an umbrella. The following is an English translation of the dandaka by my friend and co-translator (at Rasala publishers), Venetia Kotamraju. I am thankful to her for this effort at translating my poem to English.
