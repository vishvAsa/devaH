###  प्राचीनकाव्यानि
- "The myth of suparNa also known as garuDa, garutmat, tArkShyo ariShTanemiH is found in the RV itself where he is said to have obtained soma for indra e.g. RV 8.100.8."
- "The text is appended as an R^igveda-khila outside of those khilAni which are associated with actual sUkta-s. It is the oldest surviving nATaka-kAvya-s and shows that the precursors of the classical nATaka-s and kAvya-s (outside of the R^ik-s) existed even in the early Arya days. It is the only kAvya precursor of the classic style for which at least some of the verses have come down to us with svara-s. One can see those in the manuscript scanned and made available by @eGangotri. The text describes the exploits of the eagle-god garutmat in getting the soma to release his mother from the enslavement by her sister kadru."
- "Notably the connection of the play to the older layer is seen in that it remembers the old RV reflex of the myth that once garuDa had obtained soma for the deva-s."
- "This myth is of old IE provenance for it is seen in the old Germanic world where Odin assumed the form of eagle to bring the mead of poetry to the gods in Asgard from a well guarded strong after a great pursuit. A similar account dominates the soma myth but in the sauparNa play it is in the context of garuDa stealing it to release his mother. He promises indra to only show it to the sarpa-s & not give it to them. He then becomes indra's close friend."
- "This is also seen in the Greek reflex of the myth: Periphas was being honored as a god which angered Zeus who wanted to hurl the thunderbolt at him. But Apollo intervened on his behalf and made him into a giant eagle Aetos Dios who became Zeus' companion. Zeus sent the eagle to snatch Ganymede and bring him to Olympos to become the cup-bearer of the gods. Thus, the eagle does not get the drink of the gods but the cup bearer in this case."
- "A faint reflex of that is seen in king harSha's nAstika inspired play where jImutavAhana is snatched by garuDa similar to Ganymede. harSha's play can thus be traced back all the way to this old Vedic play."
- "In the yajurveda brAhmaNa portions we see the new version of this myth where he gets it release his mother vinatA the ancestress of the birds from kadru ancestress of the (snakes/lizards). This latter form is the one which forms the basis of the suparnAdhyAya."
- "It is clearly the precursor of the mahAbhArata garuDopAkhyAna. It is said to have been composed by the gotama-s of the vAmadeva lineage and was probably enacted in the schools where the RV was studied. While it is a glorification of garuDa and has minor elements of later prAjApatya overlay & v1 conceit it is squarely within the realm of the standard aindra religion."
- "Based on this we can see how the old deity was repurposed by the vaiShNava-s by reworking the original mahAbhArata reflex of it. The shaiva-s on the other hand simply declared vainateya to be an ectype of rudra himself. " [MT](https://twitter.com/blog_supplement/status/1239774138119663616)
