## Mantra-s

### What is the power of mantra-s?

It is an aid to concentrating the mind on the deity or a sentiment. This is often true in the context of a ritual.

Many attribute supernatural effects beyond it - mAraNa, vashIkaraNa, uchChATana, stambhana, mohana, vidveShaNa ... All these are said to be possible with mastery (siddhi) over a single mantra and knowledge of appropriate rituals.

- siddhI is said to be earned by practice involving diet and behavior restriction, japa, Asana-s, prANAyAma-s, secrecy (AG\_T\_27.3 [IMG](https://imgur.com/ZY9clni)) etc.. over an indeterminate period of time - under the guidance of a (dear) personal trainer/ guru (who helps avoid or counteract bad side-effects). Potential bad effects (physical, mental etc..) and errors in books (deliberate or otherwise) dissuade unguided uninitiated practice of many mantra-s.
- Greater the siddhi, tougher the things that are said to be possible. Master tAntrikas sometimes train from childhood, with a big syllabus of mantra-s and rituals - and have siddhi-s over multiple mantra-s. The deshika-s among them are said to even be capable of making new effective mantra-s for disciples.

### Whence the power of mantra-s?

#### Embodiment and reverance
- raurava-tantra: "न मीमांस्या विचार्या वा मन्त्राः स्वल्पधिया नरैः। प्रमाणमागमं कृत्वा श्रद्धातव्यं हितैषिभिः॥ सर्वे मन्त्रात्मक देवास् सर्वे मन्त्राः शिवात्मकाः। शिवात्मकमिदं ज्ञात्वैवमेवानुचिन्तयेत्॥ ... यावन्तो रुद्रदेवाश्च रक्षोयक्ष महेश्वराः। तावन् मन्त्राह् समाख्यातस् तेषाम् सम्ख्या न विद्यते॥ देशभाषा-निबद्धाश्च दिव्याक्षरपदैर्युताः। सर्वज्ञाः सर्वगाः शुद्धाः सर्वे सर्वज्ञ भाविताः॥"
- parAkhya tantra [TW](https://twitter.com/GhorAngirasa/status/867148873692835840). mantreshvaras/ vidyeshvaras as embodied aspects of brahman [TW](https://twitter.com/GhorAngirasa/status/899223199996461056), associated with particular mantra-s. The vidyesha-s are denied union with brahman just so that they can uplift us, and are therefore quite disgusted by the world (and irritable). Knowledge of this embodiment makes reverence and formality surrounding a mantra common-sense.
- "They are deities embodied in the form of objects or sounds. When one receives a mantra from an ācārya/guru (a teacher), having received proper initiation, and recites every letter of it with caution and competence, he is manifesting that very mantradevata (mantra-deity) in his mind and body, and receives the grace of that deity in the form of sound. The same goes for the very texts themselves: कामिकं पादयुग्मं स्याद्योगजं गुल्फमेव च। चिन्त्यं पादाङ्गुलिः प्रोक्तः कारणं जङ्घिका भवेत्॥" {[GA18](http://indiafacts.org/text-as-text-text-as-deity-reconciling-ritual-rules-of-textual-traditions-with-devotion-to-the-gods/)}
- "In Mimamsa-Sutra in its commentary, God has not been the subject-matter of discussion. But in the ’Devatadhikarana of Mimamsa-Sutra it has been shown that the Mimamsakas accept the God or deity 'sun' (suryadevata). To the Mimamsakas, this deity is 'sabdamayi' or 'mantramayi', to whom the sacrificial oblations are offered, and who is invoked or praised in the vedic chants. In other words, sacrifices or rituals are neither complete no fulfilled ifthere is no God. One cannot enjoy the rewards or effects ofa sacrifice unless the deity or God accepts the sacrificial substances in a proper manner. Of course, sacrifice and religious rites are ofgreat importance asthey constitute main subject matter; while offerings God (deity) etc. are subsidiary to the sacrificial rites.15" {[DC](http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/164519/11/11_chapter%208.pdf)}

#### Divine investiture
pauṣkara āgama states:
"अष्टावनन्तसूक्ष्माद्याः यथापूर्वं गुणाधिकाः। अतिसौन्दर्यलावण्या अक्षीणमनसस् सदा॥ विद्या विद्याह्वयं प्राप्तास् संख्यायास् सप्तकोटयः। प्रशान्तकलुषास् सर्वे महात्मानोऽमितौजसः॥ एतेषां यस्य वैराग्यमुपजातं महात्मनः। किम् एतेन+अधिकारेण श्रेयसः परिपन्थिनः॥ इति तं परमेशानो मलपाकमपेक्ष्य सः। स्वेच्छयैवानुगृह्णाति मुक्तिव्यक्त्यर्थयादृशा॥ ततो मुक्त्यर्थमासन्नं कनिष्ठं तत्पदे विभुः। नियुनक्त्यनुगृह्यान्यं तत्पदे नियुनक्त्यपि॥ Eight [Vidyeśvara-s]: Ananta, Sūkṣma and others; each preceding one possesses one more [divine] characteristic; they are of tremendous beauty and loveliness, they are of an ever-undiminishing mind. The Vidyā-s (another name for the mantra-s) have attained [the plane of the] Vidyā (referring to the transcendental śuddhavidyā plane discussed above); they number about seventy million. With their impurities extinguished/abated, they (the seventy million) are all great souls, of boundless strength. Of them (the mantra-s), whose dispassion has originated, [that one] is a great soul; “What with this authority (high office of being a mantra), obstructing the [greatest] good?” Thus, [seeing this dispassion for authority], Parameśāna (Śiva), considering that mantra’s [highly] mature state; he, of his own will, confers grace on any mantra closest to mukti (liberation); furthermore, the one in the smallest proximity for obtaining mukti, the lord [places that mantra] in the place [previously held by the mantra which just got liberated]. He appoints [a mantra] for liberation; he appoints another [mantra] for that [vacant] position.”

#### Avesha

Excerpts from an insightful comment from another thread by shrI[ manISha-paNDita](): 

"The mantra first creates an image of the deity which is inherently present within the mantra. That image when strong enough to take a life of its own "shields the mind". The image starts finally getting replaced for moments at a time with the actual Devatha. ..... <snip> The more the sadhaka who has managed to attract a certain Devata on occasion... repeats that mantra... the more the Devata starts to descend into the consciousness of the sadhaka. The sadhaka changes and his or her mind and personality slowly start getting replaced with the personality of the Devata in question."

### Meaning:

- To understand what a mantra says and, to feel what the mantra feels: This is one good reason why learning Sanskrit, with its stresses (svara-s) is valuable.
- General background on multi-level ways to derive meaning out of texts in general is presented [here](../../bases/books/index/).
- Some claim that it is not necessary to understand what the words in the mantra mean (to whatever extant the grammar would allow). A kautsa opinion, quoted and refuted by yAska, denies that it has any grammatical meaning (while not denying the value of the mantra in ritual ). Such opinion is condemned in quotes in shikSha texts which denounce pATha without "understanding" with the aid of vedAnga-s (शीघ्रपाठी…). (Personal note: I strongly disagree. While a mantra can contain meanings beyond what is revealed by mere grammar and vocabulary, that lower level of meaning is important in itself, and as an aid to access deeper meanings.)

### Sources of ineffectiveness
Some claim that mantra-s are ineffective in case:

- The user is not specially initiated \[Personal note: partially disagree\]
- In case some 'curse' on a mantra is not removed ([BVP16](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/bvparishat/Tz9zsuJGSN4)) \[Personal note: disagree\]

### Matching mantra-s with rituals

- nyAsa places mantra-s and deities at various parts of an object or body. Classic examples date back to the veda-s. \[[IF16](http://indiafacts.org/brief-study-possession-hinduism-ii-spiritual-context/)\]
- A general (bad) rule is "मन्त्रविनियोगो लैङ्गिकः।" , where one bases the choice of the mantra for a certain purpose based on the occurance of a similar sounding sound or word in it, not caring for the meaning (Eg. The so called durgA sUkta is mostly about agni. The "Vijyam dhanuh kapardino" has nothing to do with "vijayA" or bhAng intake where it's sometimes used.).

## mudra-s

These are the sign-analogs of mantra-s. So, similar notes apply.

Abhinavagupta and Kshemaraja considered mudrā as a “way of accessing higher layers of the cosmos, meaning individual consciousness is absorbed into or possessed (āvesa) by mudrā…one’s own body becomes possessed by the mudrā and mantra, which can be read as becoming a channel for higher cosmic powers, which erode the sense of individuality and distinction.” \[Gavin Flood, 1993.\]. Abhinavagupta, further, says that all actions of an awakened one are in fact mudrā!
