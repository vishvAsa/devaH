A mysterious deity Zqyqa of pre-Abrahamistic Arabians from the Hatra temple complex. He is believed to be the master of the netherworld with a dog. Note trishUla with likely lunar deity -an iconographic parallel across Eurasia. The Hatra +++(which was)+++ vandalized by the +++(IS)+++ Khilafat few years back.

He appears to have manifested in a benign form above & a fierce form here. The IE influences are clear: the dog; here 3-headed as yavana Kerberos. His axe is again an IE influence. The time deity on the trishUla has both the solar ray & lunar crescent. 

To the other side is the West Semitic goddess Ashtart (= East Semitic Ishtar) on throne with 2 lions; On her crown sits an eagle, while below here are the 2 fishes indicating the astronomical symbol of the colure in Pisces. It is not clear if the weapon in her hand is a club. Below the Kerberos is a 2nd dog -- the two probably represent the constellations of Canis Major and Minor. The scorpion & the bow opposite to them are likely the constellations of Scorpio & Sagittarius. The eagle on the crown of Ashtart is likely a represent of the ancient Semitic solar deity Shamash. 

Some parallels are seen in this dyad of goddesses from Palmyra which combine Iranic, Greek & Semitic elements. The eagle is likely equivalent to that seen with Ashtart. The dog is clearly reminiscent of the Iranic daenA. The first goddess is trampling a man. The second goddess is iconographically similar to the Greek Tyche/Roman Fortuna.
