## Dispersal
### Israel arrival
YHWH did not belong to the traditional pantheons of deities in the region of Syria and Canaan, His name is not found in the ancient texts of Ebla, Mari or Ugarit. YHWH was likely originally an autonomous multi functional deity in the southern region who covered the most important areas of life. Later, YHWH seemed to take on the attributes of the Levantine kingly weather god, which was His main profile during the early Judahite monarchy.

The YHWH worshipping tradition of Midianites and Kenites was adopted and reshaped by the Israelites in an early period. The first Israelites, however, worshipped El as can be seen by the name Israel.

“By the 14th century BCE, before the cult of Yahweh had reached Israel, groups of Edomite and Midianite nomads worshipped Yahweh as their god.” 

Source: K Van Der Toorn, Yahweh

Most scholars in recent decades have supported the idea that YHWH’s origins are to the south of Israel, in the area of Midian. Perhaps due to trade with Edom/Midian, YHWH entered the Israelite pantheon, at first He was seen as a son of El in this pantheon but was soon identified with El.

#### Non-canaanite features
Israelite religion has many Canaanite features, but also some that are not Canaanite like the tradition of YHWH’s southern sanctuary (Sinai), the tradition of YHWH’s theophanies from the south (Edom, Teman) and the Exodus tradition. None of these traditions appear Canaanite. 

YHWH does not appear to be a Canaanite god originally, He is not found in the Ugaritic pantheon lists. Most scholars in recent decades have supported the idea that YHWH’s origins are to the south of Israel, in the area of Midian. 

Sources: John Day, YHWH and the gods and goddesss of Canaan, Early History of God, Mark S Smith

If YHWH did not originate in Canaan why was He worshipped by Israelites? There is evidence that ancient Israel came from mainly indigenous Canaanites but there is also evidence that suggests that some Israelites were descended from pastoral non Canaanites. 

#### Syncretism
Most studies suggest they were from either one or the other, but this misses evidence that they came from both sources. A study by Brent Albert Reiser “Middle Ground, the Canaanite and non Canaanite origin of Ancient Israel as evidenced by the gods they worshipped” mentions that many in ancient Israel worshipped both Canaanite gods and YHWH who was originally a non Canaanite deity, likely a Midianite deity. This suggests the Israelites came from both Canaanites and Midianites. 

Another view is that the Israelites were Canaanites who learned about YHWH from trade and/or the Midianite Kenites role as smiths, this view is supported by some scholars. The story of Moses marrying a Midianite woman and the Midianites helping the Israelites in the desert suggest a memory of intermarriage and intermingling between the two peoples.

There is a general consensus among scholars that most pre exilic Israelites followed a syncretic religion where they worshipped both YHWH and Canaanite gods.

### Southern origin
YHWH was likely worshipped as a multi functional sky/mountain deity in Midian. The open air sanctuaries, menhirs and cairns found in Midianite territory suggest the focus of divinity was aloft, sky or mountains. The paucity of figurines found in Midianite territory suggests that their religion was aniconic. It appears that YHWH was the chief deity worshipped by the nomadic tribes in the southern region which was called “land of the Shasu, YHW” by the Egyptians.

YHWH’s Provenance from the South, Martin Leuenberger

The book of Job, which attempts to refute false opinions about YHWH and his mode of action is not set in Israel and does not involve Israelites. The savants debating YHWH’s true nature live in or near the land of Edom. Job’s friend Eliphaz is described as a Temanite. Elijah on his quest to discover YHWH’s true nature makes the long journey to Horeb instead of going to Jerusalem. These examples shows there was an earlier Yahwism that predates Israelite Yahwism and coexisted with it. 

Source: Nissim Amzallag, Metallurgy, the Forgotten Dimension of Ancient Yahwism

Ancient biblical poetry speaks of YHWH coming from the south. Midian and Edom are located to the south of Judah. 

> God comes from Teman, and the Holy One from Mount Paran. Selah. His glory covered the heavens, and the earth was full of his praise. God comes from Teman, and the Holy One from Mount Paran. Selah. His glory covered the heavens, and the earth was full of his praise. (Habakkuk 3:3)

> YHWH, when you went out of Seir, when you marched out of the field of Edom, the earth trembled, and the heavens dropped, the clouds also dropped water.
The mountains melted from before YHWH, He of Sinai before YHWH God of Israel. (Judges 5:3-4)

Old Yahwistic Hebrew poetry speaks of YHWH coming from the south. The song of Deborah presents YHWH as proceeding in triumph from Seir. Psalm 68 hails YHWH as the “one of Sinai”. Source: Joseph Blenkinsop, the Midianite Kenite hypothesis revisited and the origins of Judah.

Scholars have searched for the name Yahweh in ancient West Semitic texts, especially those found at Ebla, Mari, and Ugarit but did not find him in those pantheons.

#### Egyptian reference
Two Egyptian texts speak about the “Shasu of YHWH” Bedouin like people who lived in the Southern Levant, biblical poetry also describes YHWH as coming from the south. Midianites and Kenites who were involved in metallurgy and trade and the probably small Exodus group that left Egypt would probably have been grouped under the term “Shasu”.

Source: YHWH’s Provenance from the south, Martin Leuenberger.

Late Bronze Age Egyptian texts mention Shasu nomads in connection with the name YHW. There are also no Yahwistic place names dating from this period in Canaan. Archaeology also shows that the southern desert tribes did not represent deities other than as a sacred stones so the aniconism of Yahwism is likely original.

## Representations
### Attributes and myth
#### Smithy
Nissim Amzallag suggested that the exclusivity of the cult of YHWH was not a late development as generally assumed, he suggests that it is rooted in the ancient traditions of the Kenite metallurgists. The god of metallurgy in ancient pantheons was not a minor deity, but was considered a great deity involved in the creation of the world and humans. Source: YHWH, Canaanite god of metallurgy? Nissim Amzallag

In Isaiah 54, YHWH is described as the Creator of the world and also as the Creator of the smith. This is not said about any other human profession. The author seems to remember the ancient association of YHWH with the ancient Kenite metalworkers. 

Isaiah 54:16  Behold, I have created the metal worker who blows upon the coals in the fire, and produces an instrument for his work; and I have created the destroyer to destruct.

#### Solitariness
The solitary character of the earliest YHWH

YHWH did not belong to the traditional pantheons of deities in the region of Syria and Canaan, His name is not attested there in the late Bronze Age or Iron Age I. Martin Leuenberger assumes that YHWH was originally an autonomous deity in the southern regions who performed many different functions and covered the most important areas of life. Deuteronomy 32 appears to show YHWH as a member of a pantheon headed by El, this is probably due to YHWH’s inculturation into the land from outside (the south). Source: YHWH’s provenance from the south, Martin Luenberger.

#### Jealousy
Scholar S Goitein suggested that “YHWH whose name is Impassioned” (Exodus 34:14) refers to God’s personal name YHWH, which means “the Impassioned One,” and that this name derives from a (proto) Arabic term for passion. This reflects the idea that YHWH’s bond with his worshipers is one of passionate love, and YHWH is upset if the worshipers “cheat” by worshipping other gods. Source: Prof Israel Knohl, YHWH the Original Arabic Meaning of the Name.

Shelomo Gov Goiten suggested that the name is based on the Arabic root HWY هوي.  Prof Israel Knohl expanded this theory in his article “YHWH, The Original Arabic Meaning of the name”. Knohl suggests that God’s name means “The Impassioned One”. This idea has biblical support, Exodus 34:14 says that the name YHWH means jealous. This also fits God’s personality as described in the Bible, He loves His worshippers and helps them but is jealous and upset if they worship other gods.

According to Goiten, the exclusivity demanded by YHWH goes back to his appearance as a god among nomadic Arabian tribes. YHWH’s bond with His worshipers is one of passionate love, YHWH loves His worshippers but is upset if the worshipers “cheat” by worshipping other gods.

#### Baal and El
Imagery regularly applied to El and Baal is applied to YHWH in the Hebrew Bible such as Baal’s storm and weapon imagery and El’s imagery of creator, most high and father. Israelites, who were from a mainly Canaanite background applied all this imagery to YHWH. Source: The Early History of God, Mark S Smith.

The imagery pitting YHWH against the cosmic waters has a Canaanite background. Baal was said to be in battle with Yam (sea) and Nehar (river), these also appear in the Bible. YHWH was said to battle Leviathan and Rahab. The Israelites attributed Baal’s storm and weather imagery to YHWH who was originally worshipped in Midian. Imagery regularly applied to El is also applied to YHWH in the Hebrew Bible such as his imagery of creator, most high and father. Israelites, who were from a mainly Canaanite background applied all this imagery to YHWH. Source: The Early History of God, Mark S Smith

#### Jethro & Moses
The Bible intimates that Moses’ mission to free the Israelites from Egypt was in collusion with the Midianite priest Jethro. Jethro gave Moses leave for the undertaking (Exodus 4:18). Upon his success, Jethro greeted Moses and reaffirmed his faith in YHWH.  Jethro then offered a sacrifice to YHWH and Aaron and the elders of Israel share a ritual meal together. The ritual meal is likely a sign of the Israelites entering YHWH’s cult. God and the people had communion with each other through the ritual meal.  Jethros reason for initiating or supporting Moses’ mission may have been to pit YHWH against the Egyptian gods to show that YHWH is greater than all other gods. Source: Clinton Bailey, Bedouin Culture in the Bible

### Timna
The Midianites turned the Egyptian temple of Hathor in Timnah into a tented desert shrine. They filled it with Midianite pottery and jewellery. A bronze serpent was found which was also identified with the Midianites.

Source: Hovav the Midianite, Why was the end of the story cut? Prof Israel Knohl, A land whose stones are iron and form whose hills you can mine copper, Metallurgy, pottery and the Midianite Kenite hypothesis, Jacob E Dunn.

Archaeologists discovered a Midianite tent shrine in Timnah. Some scholars believe this tent shrine was related to the actual tent of meeting mentioned in the Torah. The items found in the shrine shed light on some Midianite practices. Round incense altars, a row of masseboth, small metal votives, an offering bench and animal bones (from goats and sheep) were found. This shows the Midianites offered incense, votive gifts and animal sacrifices to YHWH.

The site also doubled as a metal casting workshop. Source: Jacob E Dunn, A land whose stones are iron and from whose hills you may mine copper: Metallurgy, pottery and the Midianite Qenite hypothesis.

A tent sanctuary discovered by archaeologists at Timna was attributed to the Midianites. The tent sanctuary contained a row of massebot (standing stones), sandstone basins, incense altars and offering benches. Votive offerings were left at the site, these included Qurayyah painted ware and copper votive gifts. These discoveries suggest that in addition to sacrifices, incense burning, votive offerings and ritual casting were also part of Midianite rituals. The Midianite worship area did not contain any images.

The Midianite tent-shrine at Timna is the only discernable Semitic tent-sanctuary ever discovered in ancient Israel. The tent contained massebot, an offering bench, incense altars and animal bones which suggest ritual meals took place here.

YHWH the Original Arabic Meaning of the Name, Prof Israel Knoh

Archaeological findings in Timna, north of Eilat show that it was common amongst the Midianites to prohibit the representation of a deity in statue form. When the Egyptians left a mining temple in Timna, the Midianites cleared out all traces of idolatry and refurnished the temple into a Semitic desert shrine. Instead of images, they erected imageless masseboth inside the shrine.

Judaism and Islam share with earlier Yahwism the prohibition against a graven image (Ex 20, Deut 27). The Midianites and Kenites were aniconic YHWH worshippers (Prof Israel Knohl, see pinned tweet/x). The Nabateans were also originally aniconic.

> “The Midianite mutilation of the face of Hathor and the rest of the smashed objects found amid the pink cliffs of Timna, strengthen the case for a shared and jealous God, who declared from Sinai that “thou shalt have no other gods beside me.”

### Aniconism
#### Sky & mountain
YHWH was likely worshipped as sky/mountain deity in Midian. The paucity of figurines found in Midianite territory suggests that their religion was aniconic.

The archaeological evidence of the menhirs, cairns and peak sanctuaries found in Midianite territory (Tayma, Yotvata) suggests that Midian’s deity was a sky or mountain God and that He was aniconic. Prof Miller believes the name of Midian’s deity was YHWH based on both biblical and archaeological evidence. Source: YHWH, Origin of a Desert God, Prof Robert D Miller II

#### Origins
Yahwistic aniconism seems to go back to its origins, to the Midianite cult practiced in the southern Negev. The Yahwistic sanctuary at Horeb described in Exodus 24:4 seems to consist of only an altar and several standing stones. Cult sites with aniconic standing stones go back to the 11th century BCE in the Negev and Sinai. The later Nabateans continued this aniconism until the turn of the era.

Source: The birth of monotheism, the rise and disappearance of Yahwism, Andre Lemaire.

Early YHWH worship was aniconic. The Midianite worship area at Timna contained no carved images. In addition, excavations show that in the Iron Age II, Kina (now Horvat ‘Uza) which was inhabited by Kenites had no carved images whereas neighbouring Israelite towns had small carvings of people. This is because the Kenites were especially connected to their an iconic tradition.

Yahwistic aniconism seems to go back to its origins, to the Midianite cult practiced in the southern Negev. The Yahwistic sanctuary at Horeb described in Exodus 24:4 seems to consist of only an altar and several standing stones. Cult sites with aniconic standing stones have been found to go back to the 11th millennium BCE in the Negev and Sinai. The later Nabateans continued this aniconism until the turn of the era. 

Source: The birth of monotheism, the rise and disappearance of Yahwism, Andre Lemaire.

The aniconism and exclusivity of Yahwism existed before the Babylonian exile, this theology comes from the southern desert tribes (Midianites, Kenites, Amalekites) and was likely original to Yahwism. Early Yahwists were monolatrist and represented YHWH using sacred stones.



#### Rock art
Iconography found in Kuntillet Ajrud resembles rock art found in Arabia. It shows people worshipping a deity that is not depicted. This is related to the aniconism common in the religion of the southern arid regions (The Araba, southern Transjordan, the Sinai and the northern Hijaz).

Source: Juan Manuel Tebes, the Archaeology of the cult of Israel’s southern neighbours.

#### Graven images
Alongside the belief in the deity YHW, it is likely that the Hebrews adopted the prohibition of making a graven image from the Midianites. Source: Prof Israel Knohl, Hovav the Midianite, why was the end of the story cut?

#### Bedouin
Most Bedouin have been Muslim since the 7th century CE, but it is likely that the concept of an invisible God was not new to them and existed in their pre Islamic, including Midianite history. The Bedouin have an intimate, almost conversational relationship with Allah.

Source: Clinton Bailey, Bedouin culture in the Bible

### Pillars
Masseboth (standing stones) were legitimate in early Yahwism but were later phased out. Jacob built a massebah  (Genesis 28:22) and he called it house of God, the same term is used in Arabian sources. An Assyrian document describes stones where the gods dwell in. It appears that the stones were perceived as containing the god’s power or spirit. Moses also built 12 masseboth at the foot of Mt Sinai, he then made sacrifices to YHWH. (Exodus 24:4-5).

Source: Uzi Avner, Sacred Stones in the Desert.


There was a tradition of setting up unshaped masseboth (sacred pillars) amongst the Israelites and Midianites. Massebot were found in the Midianite tent shrine at Timnah and Moses is said to have erected 12 massebot at the foot of Mt Sinai (Exodus 24). Jacob also put up a massebah and called it house of God (Genesis 28). What did they mean? There were two main types, they could be aniconic representations deities or serve as an abode for them, they may have been seen as containing the god’s power or spirit. The Nabateans were also originally aniconic but later made anthropomorphic images of their gods. Source: Uzi Avner, Sacred Stones in the Desert

In the desert the masseboth were crude, unshaped stones, in the fertile lands the majority of them were deliberately shaped. But it was not lack of technology  that stopped the desert peoples from making shaped stones, they had the ability to shape them if they wanted to. The crude stone, shaped by nature or God was seen as more appropriate and sacred for cultic purposes. Source: Uzi Avner, Sacred Stones in the Desert

### Tabernacle
The tabernacle mentioned in the Torah may have been based on an earlier Midianite prototype. 


The biblical tradition of a sacred tent in the wilderness is based on historical memory, but the tent shrine was not like the lavish version described in the Priestly text, nor was it mobile. The prototype of this tent may have been discovered in Timna in the southern Arabah.


### Serpent
It is likely that the serpent was used as a symbol in early Yahwism as it was in other cultures. The serpent symbol bears a connection to a well known biblical account. Moses once crafted a bronze serpent upon the command of YHWH during the Israelites' journey through the wilderness to heal them from snake bites. 

According to 2 Kings 18, this serpent was later destroyed, allegedly because people began worshipping it instead of seeing it as a symbol. It is also possible that the symbol may have later been misunderstood.

A copper serpent was found when archaeologists excavated a Midianite tent shrine at Timnah. The remainder of the tent shrine was devoid of any imagery and consisted of imageless standing stones and altars.

A copper serpent found in the Midianite tent shrine at Timnah is reminiscent of the copper serpent described in Numbers 21:6-9.

### Anti-calf
The Israelite memory of Aaron's apostasy and his construction of a calf may come from the Midianite antipathy to bovine imagery, which was connected to the worship of Hathor or possibly her son who was depicted as a calf.  When the Midianites erected their tent shrine over the Egyptian shrine of Hathor in Timna, they effaced the representations of Hathor in her bovine form and purged all of the offerings left for the Egyptian goddess. Source:  A land whose stones are iron and from whose hills you can mine copper, metallurgy, pottery and the Midianite-Qenite hypothesis, Jacob E Dunn.

The story of the golden calf is clearly a critique of Jeroboam’s golden calves that he installed in the sanctuaries of Dan and Bethel, however, the distant memory of Timna may have also played a role in this story. The dislike of calves may also come from the Midianite antipathy to bovine imagery, which was connected to the worship of Hathor or possibly her son who was depicted as a calf.  When the Midianites erected their tent shrine over the Egyptian shrine of Hathor in Timna, they effaced the representations of Hathor in her bovine form and purged all of the offerings left for the Egyptian goddess. Source: A land whose stones are iron and from whose hills you can mine copper, metallurgy, pottery and the Midianite-Qenite hypothesis, Jacob E Dunn.


## Poyltheism
In Exodus 18, Jethro pronounced a blessing hailing YHWH as “greater than all the gods”. This suggests Midianite Yahwism did not deny the existence of other gods, but simply considered YHWH as the greatest of all gods. 

> Exodus 15:11  Who is like you, O YHWH, among the gods? who is like you, glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders?

This verse rhetorically asks “Who is like you, O YHWH” implying that other gods exist but they are incomparable and inferior to YHWH.

Early Yahwism was likely monolatrous. Monolatry is the exclusive worship of one God, whilst allowing for the existence of other deities.

### Monolatry and montheism
Scholars call exclusive worship of one god “monolatry.” While monotheism claims that no other gods exist, monolatry assumes loyalty and exclusive connection to one god, while allowing for the existence of other deities. Many biblical passages that we read nowadays as monotheistic  are really monolatrous. This monolatry goes back to YHWH's appearance as a god amongst proto Arabian tribes. From: YHWH: The original Arabic meaning of the name, Prof Israel Knohl

Monotheism was not widely observed until post exilic times.  Mondriaan’s theory proposes that marginal groups such as the Kenites and Rechabites worshipped YHWH alone and that they influenced the Israelites to worship YHWH alone. This would fit in with the theory that the earliest Yahwism practised in Midian was monolatrous, meaning that they only worshipped YHWH but did not deny the existence of other gods.

Marlene E Mondriaan suggested that the Kenites and Rechabites preserved a pre exilic YHWH alone movement from the southern tribes (Midianites, Kenites and Rechabites) who worshipped YHWH before the Israelites did. The scholarly consensus is that the Israelites practised a syncretic religion including YHWH and other gods. A strict monotheism amongst most of the Israelites was not observed until post exilic times though some groups among them may have been monolatrist such as the followers of Elijah.

Elements of Israelite religion that may have been adopted from the Midianites include: Belief in YHWH, aniconism, circumcision and the taboo against eating pork.

### Pot offerings
Midianite ware was found in Qurrayah and Timnah. Most of the pottery was miniature so they were likely votive offerings to God. A copper snake and other metal votives were also found.

### Festivals
#### Massot
Massot was a Canaanite festival where the last of the old grain was eaten in the form of Massot. Nomads also ate unleavened bread, but all the time, not just for one festival. Leavened bread was associated with the Egyptians, the nomadic shepherds ate unleavened bread.  
Sources: Julian Morgenstern, Origin of Massot and the Massot festival. Clinton Bailey, Bedouin culture in the Bible.

A feast similar to Passover was celebrated by the Kenites and other Semitic pastoralists before the time of Moses. A sacrifice of firstlings was offered to the deity to ensure good luck and safety for the coming year. Passover was later joined with the agricultural feast of unleavened bread which is believed to be Canaanite in origin. 

On Massot the Canaanites were not allowed to eat the new grain until they had offered the first sheaf of barley to the gods. Eating massot was to use up the old grain which wasn’t usually much before the new crop was harvested.


#### Pesah
The original nomadic festival of Pesah seems to have been celebrated at night and was only one nights duration, morning brought the end of the festival. In contrast, the agricultural feast of unleavened bread lasted seven days.

Pesah was a shepherds festival celebrated by the Israelites in common with all Semitic peoples in the nomad stage of civilisation.

The original purpose of the festival of Pesach was to protect flocks, homes, tents and families for the coming year. A sheep or goat was slaughtered just before nightfall and was eaten in the middle of the night. The tent posts or door posts were daubed with the blood of the slain animal. Pesach was later merged with the agricultural festival of unleavened bread and connected to the Exodus from Egypt. Sources: Hayyim Schauss, the Jewish festivals, Worship in Ancient Israel, its forms and meaning, H H Rowley.

According to some scholars, the Kenites celebrated a festival similar to the Jewish Passover in their Yahwism. The origin of Passover seems to be from the spring festival of nomadic peoples when they sacrificed the firstlings of the flock in gratitude for the deity’s blessings and in petition for a good year. Interestingly, some modern Bedouin still celebrate a similar festival.

### Pilgrimage
The practice of pilgrimage was central to religion in pre Islamic Arabia. The importance of pilgrimage in Israelite religion is likely part of the southern heritage of Yahwism. The earliest Yahwistic pilgrimage sites were probably located in the south in the areas of Seir and Edom, where YHWH was thought to dwell. The prophet Elijah made this pilgrimage to the south from Israel. Sites in the south were periodically visited and cultic rituals such as sacrifices and feasts were performed.

There is a connection between Sukkot and the Ugaritic new year festival. An autumn new year which was also a harvest festival was celebrated by the Canaanites as can be seen in the Gezer calendar.

### sabbath
The sabbath started as a cessation of daily work in Ancient Israel, it may have a connection to the earlier Babylonian Shabattum, but this is uncertain. The sabbath was a time when people would pause from work in the fields and visit the local man of God or the sanctuary. Later, the  observance of the sabbath became stricter and the Jews who left Babylon enforced their stricter sabbath on the Jews in Palestine, accusing them of profaning the sabbath by allowing markets in Jerusalem on the day.
