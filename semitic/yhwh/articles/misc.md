## Origin
### Israel arrival
The YHWH worshipping tradition of Midianites and Kenites was adopted and reshaped by the Israelites in an early period. The first Israelites, however, worshipped El as can be seen by the name Israel.

“By the 14th century BCE, before the cult of Yahweh had reached Israel, groups of Edomite and Midianite nomads worshipped Yahweh as their god.”

YHWH did not belong to the traditional pantheons of deities in the region of Syria and Canaan, His name is not found in the ancient texts of Ebla, Mari or Ugarit. YHWH was likely originally an autonomous multi functional deity in the southern region who covered the most important areas of life. Later, YHWH seemed to take on the attributes of the Levantine kingly weather god, which was His main profile during the early Judahite monarchy.

### Southern origin
The book of Job, which attempts to refute false opinions about YHWH and his mode of action is not set in Israel and does not involve Israelites. The savants debating YHWH’s true nature live in or near the land of Edom. Job’s friend Eliphaz is described as a Temanite. Elijah on his quest to discover YHWH’s true nature makes the long journey to Horeb instead of going to Jerusalem. These examples shows there was an earlier Yahwism that predates Israelite Yahwism and coexisted with it.

Ancient biblical poetry speaks of YHWH coming from the south. Midian and Edom are located to the south of Judah. 

> God comes from Teman, and the Holy One from Mount Paran. Selah. His glory covered the heavens, and the earth was full of his praise. God comes from Teman, and the Holy One from Mount Paran. Selah. His glory covered the heavens, and the earth was full of his praise. (Habakkuk 3:3)

> YHWH, when you went out of Seir, when you marched out of the field of Edom, the earth trembled, and the heavens dropped, the clouds also dropped water.
The mountains melted from before YHWH, He of Sinai before YHWH God of Israel. (Judges 5:3-4)


## Representations
### Aniconism
YHWH was likely worshipped as sky/mountain deity in Midian. The paucity of figurines found in Midianite territory suggests that their religion was aniconic.

Early YHWH worship was aniconic. The Midianite worship area at Timna contained no carved images. In addition, excavations show that in the Iron Age II, Kina (now Horvat ‘Uza) which was inhabited by Kenites had no carved images whereas neighbouring Israelite towns had small carvings of people. This is because the Kenites were especially connected to their an iconic tradition.

Yahwistic aniconism seems to go back to its origins, to the Midianite cult practiced in the southern Negev. The Yahwistic sanctuary at Horeb described in Exodus 24:4 seems to consist of only an altar and several standing stones. Cult sites with aniconic standing stones have been found to go back to the 11th millennium BCE in the Negev and Sinai. The later Nabateans continued this aniconism until the turn of the era.

Archaeological findings in Timna, north of Eilat show that it was common amongst the Midianites to prohibit the representation of a deity in statue form. When the Egyptians left a mining temple in Timna, the Midianites cleared out all traces of idolatry and refurnished the temple into a Semitic desert shrine. Instead of images, they erected imageless masseboth inside the shrine. 

The Midianites turned the Egyptian temple of Hathor in Timnah into a tented desert shrine. They filled it with Midianite pottery and jewellery. A bronze serpent was found which was also identified with the Midianites.

### Pillars
There was a tradition of setting up unshaped masseboth (sacred pillars) amongst the Israelites and Midianites. Massebot were found in the Midianite tent shrine at Timnah and Moses is said to have erected 12 massebot at the foot of Mt Sinai (Exodus 24). Jacob also put up a massebah and called it house of God (Genesis 28). What did they mean? There were two main types, they could be aniconic representations deities or serve as an abode for them, they may have been seen as containing the god’s power or spirit. The Nabateans were also originally aniconic but later made anthropomorphic images of their gods. Source: Uzi Avner, Sacred Stones in the Desert


## Poyltheism
In Exodus 18, Jethro pronounced a blessing hailing YHWH as “greater than all the gods”. This suggests Midianite Yahwism did not deny the existence of other gods, but simply considered YHWH as the greatest of all gods. 

> Exodus 15:11  Who is like you, O YHWH, among the gods? who is like you, glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders?

This verse rhetorically asks “Who is like you, O YHWH” implying that other gods exist but they are incomparable and inferior to YHWH.

Early Yahwism was likely monolatrous. Monolatry is the exclusive worship of one God, whilst allowing for the existence of other deities. According to Goiten, the exclusivity demanded by YHWH goes back to his appearance as a god among nomadic Arabian tribes. YHWH’s bond with His worshipers is one of passionate love, YHWH loves His worshippers but is upset if the worshipers “cheat” by worshipping other gods.

## Practitioners
### Rechabite
The Rechabites were a small religious sect that lived during the time of Jeremiah (Jeremiah 35). They were descended from the Kenites according to the book of Chronicles (1 Chronicles 2:55). They were Yahwists who lived in tents, did not practice agriculture and abstained from alcohol. They rejected the culture of Canaan especially the worship of Baal. Their strictness may have been a reaction to the policies of Ahab (his support of Baal worship). 

### Kenite
The Kenites were described as semi nomadic, living in tents but not exclusively like the Rechabites.   
The Kenites were a non Israelite Yahwistic tribe mentioned in the Bible. The Torah describes Moses’ father in law Jethro as a Kenite and also the priest of Midian (Exodus 3:1, Judges 1:16). “Kenites” was likely another name for the semi nomadic Midianites who were primarily metallurgists as “Kenites” means smiths. Smiths were often ritual specialists in the ancient world, they would perform circumcisions and sacrifices for other tribes. As travelling smiths, the Midianite Kenites were in an ideal position to influence others and to introduce Yahwism to the Israelites.

The semi nomadic Kenites had close ties with early Israel. The negativity towards Midian in some biblical texts suggests a real connection that some authors tried to soften.  Some parts of the biblical text suggest that the Kenites had close ties with early Israel, others describe them as enemies of Israel. The book of Judges describes Yael, a Kenite woman who helped the Israelites by defeating Canaanite Sisera as “most blessed of women”. The Kenites also helped guide the Israelites who escaped from Egypt through the desert.  Source: Hovav the Midianite, Why Was the End of the Story Cut? Prof Israel Knohl.

Moses’ in-laws are called both Kenite and Midianite. Though there are some contradictions in the Bible, this isn’t one of them. One could be both a Kenite and Midianite, a smith and a Midianite at the same time. The eponym Qayin comes from the Semitic root q-y-n which means to forge or to be a smith. It is also related to the root q-n-h which means to create.

### Midianite
The Midianites were a semi nomadic Proto-Arabian tribe who were shepherds and produced distinct decorated pottery known as Qurayyah painted ware. They were also experts in metallurgy, specifically the smelting of copper and production of bronze.

### Moses's wife
The story of Moses marrying a Midianite  woman and a Midianite priest leading a sacrifice to YHWH are unlikely to have been invented and are likely to have a historical basis. The Israelite people have memories of Midianite Kenites mixing with early Israel, especially Hobab the Kenite. These stories have the mark of authenticity, why would a marriage to a non Israelite woman be invented? Later texts describe Midianites as enemies so inventing these traditions would make little sense.

## Rites
Worship in early Yahwism consisted of prayers, blessings and sacrifices (Exodus 3:18, 18:10) in particular, sacrifices involving a communal meal shared by worshippers.

### Festivals
According to some scholars, the Kenites celebrated a festival similar to the Jewish Passover in their Yahwism. The origin of Passover seems to be from the spring festival of nomadic peoples when they sacrificed the firstlings of the flock in gratitude for the deity’s blessings and in petition for a good year. Interestingly, some modern Bedouin still celebrate a similar festival.

### Pilgrimage
The practice of pilgrimage was central to religion in pre Islamic Arabia. The importance of pilgrimage in Israelite religion is likely part of the southern heritage of Yahwism. The earliest Yahwistic pilgrimage sites were probably located in the south in the areas of Seir and Edom, where YHWH was thought to dwell. The prophet Elijah made this pilgrimage to the south from Israel. Sites in the south were periodically visited and cultic rituals such as sacrifices and feasts were performed.
