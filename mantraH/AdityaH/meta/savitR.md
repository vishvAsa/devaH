## MT's summary

### Clestial lights
Most believe that he is none other than the Sun of our solar system. Yet, the RV is quite clear about him not being the same as the sun. The sun is merely one manifestation of his activity. In particular, he is specifically linked to the celestial lights, like the rays of the sun (e.g. RV 1.35.7; 4.14.2; 5.81.4; 10.139.1) +++(It is in this context that the famed Vijayanagaran scholiast Sāyaṇa gives a large value that may be interpreted as the speed of these rays. It notably is comparable to the modern value of $c$.)+++ This relates to his golden color, which is often emphasized. The sage Hiraṇyastūpa Āṅgirasa uses the play on that word hiraṇya (golden) to encode his name in his upamaṇdala.  In RV 1.35.9 he is described as impelling the sun. Thus, he is not just the sun itself but also the force behind the diurnal motion of the sun.

### Apportioner and Probability
He is repeatedly described as the apportioner (vibhaktṛ)  and in this context is frequently coupled with the Āditya Bhaga. If Savitṛ apportions the shares, those shares are then distributed by Bhaga. Now the primary apportionment Savitṛ carries out is that of the time into days and nights. With each day Bhaga then distributes what has been ordained to the different beings. This apportionment carried out by Savitṛ is also allegorically described as the shares handed out in the game of dice described in the sūkta of the gambler (RV 10.34). This might also be a description of the probabilistic nature of the laws that Savitṛ represents.

### Impeller
The other key function of Savitṛ, which is repeatedly mentioned, is that of the impeller. The celestial movements and transformations that are his manifestation are seen as impelling various entities from humans to the sun and the heavens themselves. In the process Savitṛ is seen as transforming into other gods like Mitra and Puṣaṇ (RV 5.81.4-5).

### Gravity
Like the associated deity Vāyu in the later Vedic tradition, Savitṛ too has a gravitational role, i.e. manifesting as the force holding the cosmic realms, in the early Vedic tradition. This is stated by Arcan Hairaṇyastūpa.

### Encircling arms at night

While the solar manifestations of Savitṛ during daytime are clear, the śruti also repeatedly stresses that he is active at night. For example in RV 1.35.2 he is described as encircling the dark nightly realm bringing to rest all beings. In this context, another signal feature of his is often referred to: his great arms are mentioned as being stretched forth, signaling the beings to rest for night (e.g. RV 4.53.3). RV 7.45.1-2 mentions that these great arms of Savitṛ, which are extended when the sun cedes the world to him at night, are to be marveled and stretch up from the ends of the heaven. In RV 1.95, a parokṣa-sūkta relating to the ancient form of the pre-dawn rite of the kindling of the three fires, Kutsa Āṅgirasa compares the celestial manifestation of the god Agni to these arms of Savitṛ. While the ṛk in consideration is mostly difficult to understand, this aspect is quite clear.\\[8pt]
