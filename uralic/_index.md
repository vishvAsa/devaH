> The figure of Vainaemoinen, the patron deity of Finland is like bR^ihaspati. Both are sage deities, well known for their wisdom, they recover the sun through their spell and chanting, and both are finders of the fire. Both accompany the heroes who rescue the sun from the cave. Finally we must note that while bR^ihaspati is like Vainaemoinen, Ilmarinen is like the R^ibhus. - MT
