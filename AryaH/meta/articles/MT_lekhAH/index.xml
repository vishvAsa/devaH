      <description>&lt;p&gt;Was Dumezilian tripartation really a PIE thing or overdone? It had a place in vedic &amp;amp; shows cognates in other IE traditions. Hence, my take is that it was an old idea present in IE tradition.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the vedic tradition it is notably emphasized as the 3 basic vyAhR^iti-s. However, given that the tradition also records several other vyAhR^iti-s of different counts adding on the basic 3, it is clear that there were other concepts in parallel to tripartation. E.g. see:  exposition of the vyAhR^iti-s.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
