Seated on a shining, white lotus:  
The Great Mother, Satrig Ersang!  
The colour of her body is like the essence of gold,  
Her ornaments, attire and palace  
Are adorned by pure, golden light.  
In her right hand she grasps the Five Heroic Syllables,  
In her left, she holds a shining mirror.  
She sits on a seat supported by mighty lions adorned.  
To the Mother, from whom the Enlightened Ones  
Of the past, present, and future come forth,  
Majestic in her power to bless,  
I offer with donors of generous gifts,  
Built prostrations, praise and offerings  
In order to remove the impurity of countless beings.
