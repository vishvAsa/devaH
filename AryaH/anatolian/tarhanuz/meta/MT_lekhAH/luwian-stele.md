title = "Luwian stele"
+++

The Arsuz stele with a Luwian hieroglypic inscription showing the horned god associated with thunder holding a trident. He's possibly followed by the god associated with grain. His name remains unknown as only the hieroglyph is known. Given that Luwian is IE he was probably a deity of the indra-class whose name is believed to be Tarhunz. The Luwians, like the Iranians, adopted the winged disc symbol (above the deity). In another stele, he is shown riding a bull, like the cognate Hittite god & like indra he fights a anti-god like ahi.

Note the parallels to the iconography of Jupiter Dolichenus of the Greco-Roman tradition.
