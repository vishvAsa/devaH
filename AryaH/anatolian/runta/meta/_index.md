## प्रजापतिः
- prajApati himself could have originated as a protogonic manifestation of indra : MT
  - we have hints of that in the jaiminIya brAhmaNa.
  - In the KYV tradition this section has the verse sadasaspatim adbhutaM to indra signaling the linkage to indra within a prAjApatya sUkta via another protogonic deity of the indra class, i.e. bR^ihaspati.
  - the kaTha-s have 1 further verse not found in other extant KYV traditions: 
    yasmAd anyo na puro .asti jAto  
    ya Avivesha bhuvanAni vishvA |  
    prajApatiH prajayA saMvidAnaH   
    trINi jyotIgMShi sachate sa ShoDashI ||  
    This again links prajApati to the aindra tradition via the characteristic epithet on indra ShoDashin.
