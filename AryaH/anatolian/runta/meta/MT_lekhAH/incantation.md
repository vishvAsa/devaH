This is a proposed translation by BJ Collins of an incantation found in the Hittite text attributed to a female ritualist from around 1500 BCE. The discerning will note some interesting points. The "huntsman" is the deity runta, shown below with an a~Nkusha. 

The Hittite "pratya~NgirA" ritual in the text of the same female ritualist: She puts karsh-grain, pashsha-breads, a bow, and three arrows in a basket and places them under the bed. It remains under the bed (overnight). She ties a strip of wool to the head and foot of the bed. On the second day, when it becomes light, she takes the basket out from under the bed, waves it back and forth over the person and speaks: “O Huntsman, you return the sorcery to the sorcerer! Let it be your cure!” She cuts the wool from the bed and places it in the basket.
