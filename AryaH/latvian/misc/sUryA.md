## Orion hunting
Source: [TW](https://x.com/blog_supplement/status/2025448687485308952)

A Latvian daina showing the ancient Orion-Canis-Deer motif going back to proto-Indo-Hittite times:

Rītâ agri es redzeju  
Ka Saulite medìt gāja:  
Div' sudraba kuceniņi  
Apzeltitu briedi dzina.

Early in the morning, I saw  
How the Little Sun went hunting:  
Two silver puppies  
Chased a gilded stag.

Saulite, the diminutive Sun, the hunter, evidently represents the sun in the Orion region. The two silver puppies are Canis Major and Canis Minor with Sirius and Procyon, the golden Stag is Orion: mR^igashiras.

kucēns ~ kukkura = puppy

A Latvian version of the ashvin-s bearing sUryA in their chariot. In this daina, they bear her in a boat instead:

Ābelkoka laivu daru,   
Abi gali pazeltiti.  
Dieva dēli jīrejiņi,  
Saules meitu vizina.

I build a boat of apple-wood, 
Both ends gilded with gold. 
The God's sons are the rowers, 
Giving the Sun's daughter a ride.

meitu is cognate of English maid, German Magd instead of following duhitR^i
