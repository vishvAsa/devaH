A daina on the Latvian tvaShT^i cognate:

Kalejs kala debesîs,  
Ko tas kala, ko nekala?  
Dieva dēla jostu kala,  
Saules meitas vaiņadziņu

The Smith forged in the heavens,  
What did he forge, what did he not?  
He forged a belt for the Son of the God,  
A crown for the Sun’s daughter.

jostu ~yoktra = belt; The yoktra is the belt worn by the yajamAna-patnI in the sacrifice. It is her equivalent of the yaj~nopavIta.
