A peculiar deity found in an apparently mithrAistic context at Modena. The deity has been interpreted as: 

1. a Roman rendering of the para-Zoroastrian deity zurvan akArana. 
2. Orphic protogonic deity Phanes/ Protogonos; 
4. Chronos. 
3. Zeus who swallowed the latter. 
   
The chronic association of the deity -- thus identifying him with zurvan is seen in the form of the zodiac around him & the snake winding around him which represents the periodicity of time -- an element associated the Indo-Aryan chronic deity viShNu. However, the links to the protogonic deity on the Indo-Aryan side are seen in the form of the two halves of the egg shells on which he is standing -- the hiraNyagarbha: e.g:

> tad aNDam akarod dvaidhaM divaM bhuvam athApi cha |  
> tayoH shakalayor madhya AkAsham akarot prabhuH ||

We wonder if this iconography was directly influenced by H contact. The H contact is also suggested for Platonic Chronos, the equvivalent of the Iranic Zurvan: one of the last Platonist before their destruction by the error of Nazareth, Damascius, states that Chronos is tricephalic with the heads of a lion, a bull & a god. We believe that this iconography was influenced by viShNu trayAtman, with the boar head being replaced by a bull head. This might have had some intersection with the depictions of a leonto-cephalic deity in syncretic Roman-Iranic mithrAistic contexts where the deity is depicted in mithraeums with a single leonine head. The head of this deity might be compared with the central lion head on the torso of the Modena deity, where its flanked by a deer & ram heads. They also share the wings & the snake winding around them. 

Comparable leontocephalic deities have been found at several mithraistic shrines though his identity remains unclear -- Zurvan, Chronos, Protogonos? In this context, we may also note that an Orphic fragment states that Phanes bulls as side heads & a mighty serpent appearing in the shapes of all kinds of animals upon his head. We suspect this element of his iconography was again a transmission from a H source; probably vaiShNava. 

Some snippets on the saMkarShana:

> phaNA-maNi-sahasreNa  
> yaH sa vidyotayan dishaH ||

> saMkarShaNAtmako rudro  
> niShkramyAtti jagat-trayam  
> sa bibhrach ChikharI-bhUtam

We posit, that the "Heliodoran" vaiShNava tradition was not a local aberration but was transmitted further into the Greco-Iranian world & influenced the Orphic & the Platonic tradition dependent on it.
