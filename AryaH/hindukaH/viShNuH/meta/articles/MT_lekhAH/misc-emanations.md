The nine sAttvata-s of the sAttvata-manDala of the pa~ncharAtra are: vAsudeva, balabhadra, pradyumna, sAtyakI, akrUra, aniruddha, gada, sAmba and nishaTha. An andhra mantravAdin replaced akrUra with kR^itavarman in his performance of the yAga.

However, a distinct "vaiShNava" as opposed to "sAttvata" tradition present a concept of navavyUha, navanAyaka-s or navamUrti. There are are 1. vAsudeva; 2. saMkarShaNa; 3.pradyumna; 4. aniruddha; 5. nArAyaNa; 6. brahman; 7. viShNu; 8. varAha; 9. nR^isiMha. Some mantravAdin-s substitute hayagrIva for brahman. This 9 fold form appears to be a parallel of the shaiva navAtman-bhairava. The first 5 of these in one lineage is termed the pa~nchamUrti: saiddhAntika shaiva-s adopt this for their worship of viShNu within the maNDala of sadAshiva. In another lineage, the last 5 might be seen as the deities of the vaiShNava-pa~nchabrahma-mantra-s.

> In some enumerations, I have seen viShNu replaced by hayagrIva.
