Erotic eulogy of viShNu attributed to bhava-deva lost polymath pA~ncharAtrika tAntrika of the east who was minister 


> ॐ नमो भगवते वासुदेवाय ॥  
>
> गाढोपगूढ-कमला-कुच-कुंभ-पत्र-  
मुद्राङ्कितेन वपुषा **परिरिप्समानः** ।  
**मा लुप्यताम्** अभिनवा वन-मालिकेति  
**वाग्-देवतोपहसितो ऽस्तु** हरिः श्रिये वः ॥

> With his body marked by the impressions of the unguent on the firm pot-like breasts of Kamalā (Laksmī) whom he had just hugged, he wished to embrace [the speech-deity].
May that Hari [then] taunted by the speech-deity thus, "Do not mess up your new forest-flower garland", bring you wealth.

the equivalence of sarasvatI & puShTI is established right in the mahAbharata +++(क्व??)+++ & is placed in a vaiShNava context in the matsya purANa +++(क्व??)+++. 

So the identification of the 2nd wife as vAgdevatA is a direct acknowledgement of this connection; this also applies to the early pA~ncharAtra mantra where puShTi is identified as aniruddha's shakti as is also sarasvatI.
