title = "hayagrIva bhairava"
+++

A most remarkable Kashmirian 10 headed viShNu vishvarUpa from late kArkota age. The first triad of heads are the usual nR^isiMha-viShNu-varAha triad; the next triad is bhairava-maheshvara-umA; then the 3 vyUha deities; the worn-out one on the top is likely hayagrIva.

One can find some parallels to vishvarUpa vibhava of viShNu from some pA~ncharAtrika texts. The above (haribhaktivilAsa quote) indeed seems to be a citation of hayashIrsha. It might also be seen as an expression of the general prescription given in the jayAkhya. However, the hayashrISha at the top makes think it might be related to the hayashIrsha-centric vishvarUpa. 

While I have not found a precise description of such in any tantra to date we may note that in the Kashmirian locus there is an identification of hayagrIva with sadAshiva or the bhairava which is brought out in his mUrti. For e.g, in his tantrAloka, while discussing amR^iteshvara & related vidyA-s abhinavagupta states:

> haMsa hayagrIva vibho sadAshivas tvaM paro.asi jIvAkhyaH |  
> ravi-soma-vahni-sa~NghaTTa-bindu-deho ha-ha-ha samutkrAma |

Then the parA tantra referring to mantra texts mentions

> kAlachakraM samvaraM cha hayagrIvAkhya bhairavam |

This hayagrIva of the bhairava form & conforms with the idea that bhUta-srotas taught the shaiva hayagrIva vidyA. 

Finally, in the eastern locus, such a form is hinted in the kAlikA-purANa which assumes a vaiShNava hayagrIva center in kAmAkhya before the shAkta dominance. The worship of this hayagrIva is still recommended in the kAlikA & suggests a worship of hayagrIva conjoint with the bhairava, vAsudeva, viShNu and varAha.
