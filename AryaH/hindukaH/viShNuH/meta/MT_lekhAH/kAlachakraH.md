> āvartamānam ajaram vivartanam  
> șan-nemikam dvādaśāram suparva |  
> yasyedam āsye pariyāti viśvam  
> tat kālacakram nihitam guhāyām ||  
> 
> Eternally turning forth and turning back,  
> with a six-sectored felly, twelve spokes, and a good linchpin into whose mouth all existence rushes forth, that wheel of time is stationed in the [secret] cave of existence.

It goes back to the RV where viShNu is seen as setting the wheel of time of time in motion. There are several allusions to this in the bhArata.
