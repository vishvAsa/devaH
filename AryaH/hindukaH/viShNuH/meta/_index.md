- विष्णुः सर्वव्यापकः।
- त्रिविक्रमवान् उरुगायः, खे श्रोणापतिः, खे ध्रुवस्थापकः।
  - युगकृद् देवः! यस्यावतारैर् अयनचलनं ज्ञायते।
- स उपेन्द्रः, देव सहायकः।
- यज्ञरूपः। आध्वर्यवपरम्परया सम्बद्धः (शुक्लयजुर्वेदो यत् पाञ्चरात्रिकप्रियः, कृष्णश्च वैखानसः)।
  - विष्णुर् वै यज्ञस्य दुरिष्टम् पाति वरुणः स्विष्टम्। तयोर् उभयोर् एव शान्त्यै॥
- नक्षत्रपुरुषो महानारायण इति केचित्।
- "The Vāsudeva in his human manifestation (Kṛṣṇa Devakīputra) consorts with a large number of women. Viṣṇu consorting with a bevy of goddesses is already mentioned in RV 3.54.14. This also relates to his early fertility role as the protector of the sperm of males."

- "Already in the RV Viṣṇu is repeatedly mentioned as being the cowherd or the cow-protector (RV 1.22.18; RV 3.55.10). Thus, this aspect of the Devakīputra of the Sātvata religion are likely merely a humanization of an old trait of the deity."

## प्राचीनता
- "Viṣṇu is a prominent deity of early Indo-European vintage. Mentioned 113 times in Ṛgveda itself (Table 1), one can already sense his prominence in the pantheon. ... His cognate in the Germanic world Víðarr provides evidence of his importance in the early undivided IE days.

### यजुर्वेदे प्राचुर्यम्
- "extraordinary prominence of Viṣṇu in the Vedic tradition represented by the Yajurveda. This is clearly in contrast with the other Vedic tradition, namely that of the Samaveda. Tellingly, the one Samavedic text that is enriched in Viṣṇu is the Mantra-brāhmaṇa, which is primarily a collection of yajuṣ-es within the Samavedic tradition. This short collection of yajuṣ-es has the same order of magnitude of mentions of Viṣṇu as the SV Kauthuma-saṃhitā and Pañcaviṃśa-brāhmaṇa, both of which are several times the size of the Mantra-brāhmaṇa."

## कृष्णः
- रोहिणी-नक्षत्रे चन्द्र-वंशे जातो ऽसौ मध्यरात्रौ - चन्द्रस्य प्रियतमा हि रोहिणी। अष्टम्यां च तिथौ स जातो, येन चन्द्रोदयो ऽपि मध्यरात्रौ स्यात्। 

## जनान्तरे
### Víðarr
- "In the Gylfaginning of the Icelandic prose Edda, Snorri Sturluson, who still had links to the old Germanic heathenism, described Víðarr thus: “Víðarr is the name of the silent asa. He has a very thick shoe, and he is the strongest next after Thor. From him the gods have much help in all hard tasks. ” ..."
- "Finally, his thick shoe is related to the stride Víðarr takes in the final battle of the gods, Ragnarok, where he tramples the nether jaw of the demonic Fenris-wolf and opens its mouth wide apart to slay it. ... This is related to again related to the etymology of Víðarr = “wider” and the very cognate of Víðarr, vitara, appears in the śruti in the context of Viṣṇu: athābravīd vṛtram indro haniṣyan sakhe viṣṇo vitaraṃ vi kramasva ||" 
- "Both Viṣṇu and Víðarr are mentioned as possessing a special world/realm. In the case of Viṣṇu, who is called the “cowherd” or the cattle-protector, it is wide pasture in a mountainous realm. Víðarr’s is a case it is mentioned a thick with grass."
- "Finally, we may note that Víðarr is one of the deities to survive the Ragnarok and usher in the new Germanic “satyayuga”. Among the ārya-s, as the “time-god”, he is seen as again surviving the yuga-s in the later Viṣṇu-centric traditions."

### Taranis
"In the Celtic world, the chief Gaulish deity of the Indra-class, Taranis, appears to have absorbed elements of his partner, the deity of the Viṣṇu-class. We go somewhat out on a limb to suggest that the late iconography of Taranis, before the end of the Gaulish religion, was actually influenced by that of Viṣṇu carried either directly by Indian or Indianized Iranic travelers to the West or from them via intermediaries to the Gauls (Figure 1). Examples of this influence are seen in the wheel-wielding images of Taranis and his depiction on the famous Gundestrup cauldron. In the case of the latter, the Indian influence is clinched by the elephants associated with the goddess (probably Rhiannon) who is depicted similar to Lakṣmī the wife of Viṣṇu.

### Rashnu Razishta
- "Rashnu Razishta, the heavenly judge, who superficially plays a Citragupta-like role. His name and sudden appearance without parallels elsewhere in the IE world suggests that he is none other than a cognate of the Indo-Aryan Viṣṇu. His name probably underwent a folk-linguistic mutation from ‘vi’ to ‘ra’ for the Iranians probably (wrongly) interpreted the ‘vi’ as a prefix with a negative connotation and “corrected” it to ‘ra’ the proper one (A suggestion also made by Puhvel/Dumezil though, in my opinion wrongly, opposed by some Indo-Europeanists). His popular worship among the Iranians is hinted by the occurrence of his name as part of personal names found in the Persepolis Fortification Tablets from the time of the Achaemenid emperor Darius-I: Rashnudāta and Rashnuka and the Parthian name Rashnumithra."
- "Rashnu’s link to Viṣṇu is indicated by his accompanying Mithra to his right on his chariot when he rides forth for battle. In the Zoroastrian strain of the Iranic religion, Mithra with his vazra has taken the place of Indra and Rashnu retains the role of Viṣṇu now as Mithra’s assistant instead (Note that even RV Viṣṇu is linked to Mitra in RV 1.156.1). Notably, Yasht 12 to Rashnu (which has been clearly redacted to interpolate Ahura Mazdā’s name for Rashnu in the initial manthra-s) shows that he held an important role in the ritual and he is described as tall, forceful deity praised in superlative terms indicating the importance he once held in Iranian realm: rashnvô ashâum rashnvô razishta rashnvô spênishta rashnvô vaêdhishta rashnvô vidhcôishta rashnvô parakavistema rashnvô dûraêdareshtema rashnvô arethamat bairishta rashnvô tâyûm nijakhnishta…"  
- "This peculiar feature of the yasht, seen with no other Iranic deity, points to two parallels with Viṣṇu: (1) The listing of the realms is suggestive of Viṣṇu pervading them or striding over them. (2) Among the places Rashnu is invoked there are 3 stations mentioned in succession the quarters of the earth, boundary of the earth and all over the earth. Apart from reminding one of the three strides, it also reminds one of the ṛk where Viṣṇu is described as fixing the boundary of the earth by the pegs at the quarters (RV 7.100.3)."
