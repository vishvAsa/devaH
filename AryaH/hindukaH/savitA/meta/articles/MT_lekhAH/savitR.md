While the Sāvitrī remains a popular mantra among modern Hindus, most of them do not know its deity. Even of those who know Savitṛ to be the deity, few have a clear idea of the nature of this god. Most believe that he is none other than the Sun of our solar system. Yet, the RV is quite clear about him not being the same as the sun. The sun is merely one manifestation of his activity. 

## Light linkage
In particular, he is specifically linked to the celestial lights, like the rays of the sun (e.g. RV 1.35.7; 4.14.2; 5.81.4; 10.139.1) [4](#fn4). 

This relates to his golden color, which is often emphasized. The sage Hiraṇyastūpa Āṅgirasa uses the play on that word hiraṇya (golden) to encode his name in his upamaṇdala. In RV 1.35.9 he is described as impelling the sun. Thus, he is not just the sun itself but also the force behind the diurnal motion of the sun.  

## Apportionment
He is repeatedly described as the apportioner (vibhaktṛ) and in this context is frequently coupled with the Āditya Bhaga. If Savitṛ apportions the shares, those shares are then distributed by Bhaga. Now the primary apportionment Savitṛ carries out is that of the time into days and nights. With each day Bhaga then distributes what has been ordained to the different beings. 

This apportionment carried out by Savitṛ is also allegorically described as the shares handed out in the game of dice described in the sūkta of the gambler (RV 10.34). This might also be a description of the probabilistic nature of the laws that Savitṛ represents. 

## Impeller
The other key function of Savitṛ, which is repeatedly mentioned, is that of the impeller. The celestial movements and transformations that are his manifestation are seen as impelling various entities from humans to the sun and the heavens themselves. In the process Savitṛ is seen as transforming into other gods like Mitra and Puṣaṇ (RV 5.81.4-5).  

Like the associated deity Vāyu in the later Vedic tradition, Savitṛ too has a “gravitational” role, i.e. manifesting as the force holding the cosmic realms, in the early Vedic tradition. This is stated by Arcan Hairaṇyastūpa.  

स॒वि॒ता य॒न्त्रैः पृ॑थि॒वीम् अ॑रम्णाद् अस्कम्भ॒ने स॑वि॒ता द्याम् अ॑दृंहत् ।  
अश्व॑म् इवाधुक्ष॒द् धुनि॑म् अ॒न्तरि॑क्षम् अ॒तूर्ते॑ ब॒द्धं स॑वि॒ता स॑मु॒द्रम् ॥ RV 10.149.1  

While the solar manifestations of Savitṛ during daytime are clear, the śruti also repeatedly stresses that he is active at night. For example in RV 1.35.2 he is described as encircling the dark nightly realm bringing to rest all beings. In this context, another signal feature of his is often referred to: his great arms are mentioned as being stretched forth, signaling the beings to rest for night (e.g. RV 4.53.3). RV 7.45.1-2 mentions that these great arms of Savitṛ, which are extended when the sun cedes the world to him at night, are to be marveled and stretch up from the ends of the heaven. In RV 1.95, a parokṣa-sūkta relating to the ancient form of the pre-dawn rite of the kindling of the three fires, Kutsa Āṅgirasa compares the celestial manifestation of the god Agni to these arms of Savitṛ. While the ṛk in consideration is mostly difficult to understand, this aspect is quite clear.  
उद् यं॑यमीति सवि॒तेव॑ बा॒हू उ॒भे सिचौ॑ यतते भी॒म ऋ॒ञ्जन् ।  
उच् छु॒क्रम् अत्क॑म् अजते सि॒मस्मा॒न् नवा॑ मा॒तृभ्यो॒ वस॑ना जहाति ॥ RV 1.95.7;  
He (Agni) repeatedly raises up, like Savitṛ, his two arms, he stretches himself to the two horizons \[of the sky\], the fierce straight-goer.  
He impels his shining armor from his own self; he leaves new clothes for the mothers.  
The first hemistich compares the rising Agni with the arms of Savitṛ and specifically their stretching from horizon to horizon. So what is the foundation of this shining manifestation of Savitṛ in the night sky that stretches from horizon to horizon? It is the Milky Way. Thus, this signal feature of Savitṛ, which repeatedly finds mention in ritual incantations relates this great stellar band of light of the night sky. Hence, both in his diurnal and nocturnal apparitions, Savitṛ is a deity of stellar manifestation par excellence.
