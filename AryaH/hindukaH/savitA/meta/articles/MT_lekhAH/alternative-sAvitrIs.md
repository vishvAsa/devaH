Today the Sāvitrī is universally used by all dvija-s for their saṃdhyopāsanā/ Savitrupāsanā. However, we know that the saṃdhyā rite goes back to at least the Indo-Iranian period. This raises the question as to whether there was a Savitrupāsanā before the extant Sāvitrī was composed by Viśvāmitra. It is notable that Viśvāmitra himself specifically mentions that the god is worshiped 3 times in a day.

Then again he states:

> त्रिर् आ दि॒वः स॑वि॒ता सो॑षवीति॒  
> राजा॑ना मि॒त्रावरु॑णा सुपा॒णी । RV 3.56.7
>
> Thrice a day Savitṛ repeatedly impels \[with\] the two kings, Mitra and Varuṇa, of good hands.

We take the above references to the rite ordained thrice a day to be none other than an ancient version of the extant Savitrupāsanā, especially given that he mentions Mitra and Varuṇa, who also receive worship at the twilights along with Savitṛ. Now Viśvāmitra is not the only sage who mentions the rite of Savitṛ performed 3 times a day. Vāmadeva Gautama alludes to it too:

> ये ते॒ त्रिर् अह॑न् सवितः स॒वासो॑  
> दि॒वे-दि॑वे॒ सौभ॑गम् आसु॒वन्ति॑ । RV 4.54.6
>
> O Savitaḥ, thrice a day your impulsions are those which impel good fortune day after day

Hence, we suspect that the three-fold daily Savitrupāsanā was already a prevalent form of worship even in the days of the RV and not started by Viśvāmitra for the first time. This mantra-practice was also likely associated with the repeated allusion to the śloka or the call of Savitṛ, which marked these transition points of the day. From a study of the RV it appears that several families might have originally had mantra-s comparable to the Vaiśvāmitra Sāvitrī, which later became universal. The mantra-s presented below are examples of themes parallel to the Sāvitrī in the compositions of other clans:

> तद् राधो॑ अ॒द्य स॑वि॒तुर् वरे॑ण्यं व॒यं दे॒वस्य॑ प्रस॒वे म॑नामहे । RV 1.159.5    
> Today we shall meditate on that excellent favor/power of the Deva Savitṛ at \[his\] impulse.

> दे॒वस्य॒ श्लोकं॑ सवि॒तुर् म॑नामहे ॥ RV 7.82.10    
> We meditate upon the call of deva Savitṛ.  

> श्रेष्ठे॑ स्याम सवि॒तुः सवी॑मनि॒  
> तद् दे॒वाना॒म् अवो॑ अ॒द्या वृ॑णीमहे ॥ RV 10.36.12
>
> May we be in the best impulsion of Savitṛ: that aid of the gods we choose today.

Some of these mantra-s use the word अद्य, i.e. today, perhaps suggesting that the rite was done daily. They are conceptually similar to the Sāvitrī in choosing meditating or focusing on the impulsion or the power of the god.
