In modern tantrika parlance the&#xA;suShumna mentioned in this R^ik is taken to mean the suShumna nerve&#xA;path, but it is clear that in the vaidika context in simply meant&#xA;well-disposed. This word (i.e. sumna) is often used in the context of&#xA;rudra. For those who are insiders of the mantra-shAstra and those who&#xA;are endowed with the j~nAna, certain words reveal the deep underlying&#xA;inspiration in the mantra. They who recognize the import these words are&#xA;able to instantly or gradually “connect” to the mantra and cognize or&#xA;see the devatA, unlike a lay practitioner, or an indologist, or one&#xA;merely filled with ignorant bhakti. In the case of vaidika mantra-s this&#xA;knowledge has declined among most practitioners. In the case of this&#xA;mantra the key words are “bhuvanasya pitaraM” and “bR^ihantaM&#xA;R^iShvam”]&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>paschimAmnAyeshvarI and shiva of the shikhA</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2006/12/05/paschimamnayeshvari-and-shiva-of-the-shikha/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We first salute the master of the school, matsyendra and ku~nkumAMbA&#xA;who was his kulA~NganA without whom none of these mysteries would be&#xA;known to us mortals.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;“siddhamAtA vibhuH shabdarAshIti yonyArNavI vAgvishuddhAsi vAgeshvarI”&lt;br&gt;&#xA;That provides the inspiration of the rudra-shaktI – mahAsenasambhoginI.&#xA;The one with pretty curves, who is the queen under the chinchini tree,&#xA;manifests simultaneously in all her glory in the great oDDiyAna,&#xA;jAlandhara, pUrNagiri and kAmarUpa. The very name kubjIshAna causes the&#xA;ullAsa that cannot be described in words, the leading steps on the kula&#xA;path. Even a moment of revelation of kubjIshAna is just like the&#xA;drinking of the tIvra soma, sweeted for the sacrificial rite. He is the&#xA;glorious navAtman like a thunder cloud, the wielder of the pinAka bow.&#xA;On his lap, like streak of brilliant lightning illuminating that roaring&#xA;thunder cloud is our goddess, paschimAmnAyeshvarI, the queen of the&#xA;samayavidyA. The one who can recite the daNDakaM recalls the words “tvaM&#xA;navAtmAnadevasya chotsa~NgayAnAshritA“.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;From the 32 syllabled samayavidyA’s shikhA mantra emanates svachChanda,&#xA;who is the manifestation of the tantric aghora mantra. One who has&#xA;stilled his mind for the expansion of the mighty samayavidyA sees a&#xA;preta ma~ncha. On that is seated lokeshvara, the mighty yogin bearing&#xA;the universe in him. On him emerges a bright blue lotus. In the pericarp&#xA;of that lotus is seen the terrific serpentine ananta, blazing forth with&#xA;all-conquering power of heat and other radiations. He is the deadly&#xA;kAlasaMkarShaNa, armed with a musala and halAyudha. On his shikhA is&#xA;seen an eight-petalled lotus. In that is the powerful shiva of the&#xA;shikhA or svachChanda. From him emerge 32 brilliant mayUkhas, which are&#xA;the energies of the samaya-vidyA. He is adorned by ornaments of various&#xA;colors. He has 4 heads and 10 hands and inspires extreme terror. At the&#xA;same time he is imbrued with the shR^ingAra rasa and tightly hugs a devI&#xA;of dark color, the great dUtI, with ornaments of all colors. In her&#xA;manifests the power of the vaShaT.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2006/11/17/killing-of-andhaka/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Having bowed to the one whose odd eye roasts the universe at the end of&#xA;the kalpa we narrate his awful exploits.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When rudra and umA were sporting on the eastern ridges of the mandhara,&#xA;umA closed the eyes of one who simply known as the god because even his&#xA;name can terrify the uninitiated. When his eyes were closed by umA’s&#xA;hand which had the complexion of coral and a golden lotus the universe&#xA;turned exceedingly dark, for after all he is soma-sUryAgni-lochana.&#xA;umA’s hands heated by his eye on the forehead began to sweat copiously&#xA;and resulted in divine conception due to contact with the god. A&#xA;terrifying being manifested itself. It was blind, deformed, and black in&#xA;complexion, with matted locks of hair on the head and fine down all over&#xA;the body. It sang and laughed horribly, danced and put out its tongue&#xA;like a serpent and roared fiercely. haimavatI aghast at the sight asked&#xA;what it was. rudra said, you made it yourself by closing my eyes. She&#xA;took her hands of his eyes and as the light came back the being looked&#xA;even more hideous. rudra said: this awful being is andhaka, the blind&#xA;one, who was born when you closed my eyes. Take care of him well as he&#xA;is an object of our creation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Now we shall&#xA;describe that meditation of and the mantra emanation from it.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;-As one starts the meditation of the pa~nchAkSharI one sees the maNDala&#xA;of eight kalA goddesses appearing in the eight directions:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;vAmA- brilliant white complexion, (E); jyeShThA -blood red, (SE);&#xA;raudri- white again, (S); kAlI- bright yellow, (SW) ; kalavikariNI-&#xA;purple, (W); balavikariNI- shining gold, (NW); balapramathanI-black, (N)&#xA;sarvabhUtadamanI-light red, (NE). manonmanI appear in the middle of the&#xA;maNDala with complexion of a bright blowing light. One then realizes&#xA;manonmanI within one self and the entire maNDala of the kalA goddesses&#xA;surround you.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The terrible vinAyaka is&#xA;dancing performing a loud aTTahAsa, holding a sharp axe in one of his&#xA;stout arms. He is surrounded by the fearful goblins armed with all kinds&#xA;of weapons. Each of the eight mothers is surrounded by her daughters.&#xA;Together they form the complete circle of mothers. They are-&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It is different from the amR^iteshvara vidya,&#xA;like that described in the netra tantra tradition. The latter is&#xA;shAntaM, while the saMkShipta bhairava formulae are ghoraM. It can also&#xA;be used for mAraNa strikes when conjoined with mahAmArI, the mate of the&#xA;fierce bhairava, and the mantra of yama. The bhArgava mArkaNDeya is the&#xA;R^iShi of the mantra of the terrifying saMkShipta bhairava. He is&#xA;meditated upon holding mahAmArI in his grasp. He is dancing on preta-s&#xA;lying on the shmashAna. His face is terrifying with 3 eyes and a crown&#xA;of upward-standing hair. He has sharp fangs in his mouth. He has 8 arms,&#xA;and holds a trident, the pinAka bow and pAshupata missile, a&#xA;skull-topped khaTvA~Nga, a lasso, sword, a chakra and a fire pot. His&#xA;wife mahAmArI is of deep blue complexion, with long flowing locks of&#xA;black hair and is embracing the fiery bhairava. The frightful yama is&#xA;standing revertially worshiping them. Beyond him is standing the most&#xA;bewitching pradhAna yakShiNI, pramodA with her yakShiNI hordes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2006/05/20/the-arimaspas-dinosaurs-griffins-and-sharabha/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A persistant Indo-Iranian motif is that of the griffin, occuring in&#xA;India as the sharabha. The sharabha may be described as an imaginary&#xA;animal or as an incarnation of rudra in that form. The famous&#xA;sharbhAstra weapon and the sharabhAstra mantra invoke this form of&#xA;rudra. The form of viShNu known as the gaNDabherunda nR^isiMha is also&#xA;inspired by the same beast. The greek chroniclers recorded the griffins&#xA;as being associated with an Iranian tribe on the steppe known as the&#xA;Arimaspas. They were described as great horsemen, as their name suggests&#xA;and are supposed to have fought the griffins. The griffins are also&#xA;described as fighting the Amazons. The griffins are supposed to have&#xA;guarded gold in central Asia from the Arimaspas. The Pazyryk graves&#xA;which have been studied over the past century in detail have gold&#xA;articles, griffin depictions and contain the bodies of female steppe&#xA;warriors. This suggests that the tales of the Arimaspa and the Amazons&#xA;are confused Greek accounts for Indo-Iranian tribes of the far east,&#xA;from whose midst the reports of the griffins first started emerging.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Fourier of maNgalagrAma, was initiated into&#xA;bagalAmukhI vidyAs by the powerful chera magician. bagalAmukhi&#xA;deployments can be terrifying for the victim and there are many of them&#xA;that are generally kept secret. Some bagalAmukhi deployment that I have&#xA;come across include: 1) the dhattUra haritAla lepana prayogaM- the&#xA;yellow orpinient made from a mixture of dhattUra bIja and turmeric which&#xA;can used for stambhana and vashikaraNa. 2) The mR^ittika vR^iShbha&#xA;prayogaM -its effects can resemble the effects of certain dhUmAvatI&#xA;prayoga-s and can be mistaken for them. It is pretty debilitating. 3)&#xA;The vAma kapAla prayogaM- can cause a severe stambhana of the victim. 4)&#xA;The shava vastra maNdUka prayogaM- can paralyze the tongue or throat of&#xA;the shatru. 5) The ATarUShaka prayogaM- can destroy attacking law&#xA;enforcement agents. 6) indrAvAruNika prayogaM- can protect from being&#xA;tortured by law enforcement agents. And there are several others.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

These idols were originally from temples of&#xA;trishiro bhairava near parihAsapura. They show the left side ugramukha&#xA;which is (rudra murti) and may have a kapAla, kamaNDalu and akShamAla in&#xA;the hands. The same iconography is retained for dattAtreya but, the&#xA;kApAla of the trishirobhairava form is not seen. The temples were&#xA;destroyed and the idols damaged by the Moslems and their current status&#xA;is unclear. The representation of the deity as trishiro-bhairava and&#xA;dattAtreya were both supposed to have dogs beside them, but their&#xA;presence in these idols is unknown.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It is filled with the fury&#xA;of rudra mahAdeva. The agni in the midst becomes rudra and the&#xA;sacrificer readies to pacify him. He recites thus:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;rudró vA eShá yád agnís tásya tisráH sharavyAH pratIcI tiráshcy anUcI&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This fire is rudra, three are his missiles, one that strikes straight,&#xA;one transversely, and one that strikes from below (These are the 3 stars&#xA;of Orion, the invakas, which are the 3 arrows fired by rudra slaying&#xA;prajapati).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The shatru senA is as though rushing&#xA;forward when it is suddenly attacked from the flanks by flaming missile&#xA;shot by the agents of rudra. Each bhairava mantra is like a shower of&#xA;fatal arrows raining on them with unstoppable fury.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Meditate upon the Adi-guru, the kShatriya woman, lakShmI~nkarA, who is&#xA;the founder of the lineage of teachers of the lore of the bhairava in&#xA;the kali yuga, the great princess, the sister of the noble rAjan&#xA;indrabhUtI. She is of lotus complexion, of splendid beauty, seated in in&#xA;padmAsana, graced by a crimson tilaka, with her long eyes painted with&#xA;black collyrium, showing the gyAna mudra surrounded by students&#xA;receiving the bhairava vidyA from her. She has condensed the secret&#xA;vidyAs of bhairava of gAlava, vishvAmitra, bhArgava, yamoghaNTa, shUka,&#xA;shikhin and others.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2005/05/30/ashvina-stuti/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The adi parvan of the mahAbhArata provides a remarkable “fossilized”&#xA;sUktaM to the ashvins. It comes in the 3rd chapter of the adi parvan&#xA;known as the pauShya section (1.3.60 in the critical Poona edition of&#xA;the mahAbhArata). This section is a particularly interesting in terms of&#xA;retaining some of the archaic structures of the epic, probably coming&#xA;unadulterated from the original form of the jaya epic. Its frame&#xA;narrates the tale of how janamejaya, the kuru emperor, and conqueror of&#xA;takShashIla came to perform his infamous sarpa yaGYa to avenge the&#xA;killing of his father parIkShit by the nAga chief. From this frame bud&#xA;off many archaic tales, one of which is the tale of trial of the sage&#xA;upamanyu of the clan of the vasiShThas. In this tale, upamanyu as a&#xA;young student in the ashrama of his teacher Ayodo dhaumya was&#xA;particularly well-fed in his appearance. dhaumya cuts off his means of&#xA;food, namely from the alms received in the city or from the cows he took&#xA;to graze, by instructing him not to eat or drink any of those things. In&#xA;this state dhaumya asked upamanyu to go and graze his cows. upamanyu&#xA;without any food eats the leaves of the arka plant and as a consequence&#xA;goes blind and falls into a pit while crawling about. Upon seeing his&#xA;absence at sunset that day, dhaumya and his students set out in search&#xA;of upamanyu and call out to him in the pastures. They hear him crying&#xA;out from a pit and mention his blindness. dhaumya asks him to invoke the&#xA;ashvins. He immediately composes a series of R^ichas with which he&#xA;praises the ashvins. As a result they are pleased and give him an apUpa&#xA;cake. upamanyu states that he will eat the cake only after offering it&#xA;to his teacher. They urge upamanyu to do so without offering him, but he&#xA;refuses. Pleased with his devotion they relieve him of his blindness and&#xA;the twin gods also give him a denture of gold, unlike the steel denture&#xA;they had given his teacher dhaumya. As a result dhaumya states that&#xA;upamanyu has passed his trial and blesses him to be a great scholar of&#xA;the vedas and the dharmashAstras.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It&#xA;is full-fledged development was in India and not in Mesopotamia or&#xA;Egypt.

However, it is not entirely clear what mantra is meant by this name.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One likely candidate is the tryambaka R^ik. However, there is another archaic connection that should be mentions in this regard (especially given that the kAlottara mentioned the amR^itarudra in the context of atharvan mantra-s). Chapter 3 of the atharvashiras, after describing the universal form of rudra, provides a verse corresponding to the famous R^ik RV 8.48.3, thereby connecting amR^ita and rudra:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;WRT the boar; In Iranic tradition:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;verethraghnO ahuradhAtO hu kehrpa varAzahe&lt;br&gt;&#xA;paiti-erenO tizhi-dãstrahe arshnO tizhi-asUrahe&lt;br&gt;&#xA;hakeret-janO varAzahe anu-pOithwahe grañtahe ||&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;verethraghna is invoked as a mighty boar.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In yasna 6.14:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;ukhrem taxmem dAmOish upamanem yazatem yazAmaide |&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This dAmOish upamana is mighty boar that accompanies mithra on his march. The Germanic occurrence of a boar is hence interesting.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;ve convergently suspect that the north- Germanic Hild swine as Odr was an ectype of Odin giving a direct link to the rudrian divo varAha of the Arya-s. That is indeed an important connection &amp;ndash; good job! I&amp;rsquo;d add that the rudrian connection is augmented by the inheritance of the boar nature by the sons of rudra in gotama&amp;rsquo;s incantation upon his direct vision of the marut-s:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/GhorAngirasa/status/1579789400736550912&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;interesting to note that the Vayu Purana account of the episode also has this feature of Devi not being there as Sati, but instead with Shiva the whole time and similar sentiments to the above&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;ghorangirasa-analysis&#34;&gt;GhorAngirasa analysis&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Mbh version is indeed similar to Vāyupurāṇa version. The fact that the story occurs with both Sati &amp;amp; Pārvati kind of lends support to the notion that the story is not about FIL-SIL dynamics but really goes back to the archaic Vedic meme of the Devas ostracising Rudra. Also, Dakṣa’s pointed reference to the sufficiency of the august presence of the 11 Rudras &amp;amp; express move to not recognize &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; Rudra is interesting. He also refers to the 11 Rudras’ tridents &amp;amp; Jaṭa (matted locks). Given that, it was not that Dakṣa had a problem with the “Raudra” class per se but only the great Rudra. One wonders if Dakṣa is representative of certain misled ritualists’ reluctance to give importance to &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; Rudra in favour of the 11-set.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What does the term tryambaka mean? We hold that it means mother -&amp;gt; goddess. This is supported by the fact the ritual devoted to this form of rudra also invokes the goddess ambA. The ritual sUtra-s mention the 3 rudrian goddess rudrANI, bhavAnI &amp;amp; sharvANI &amp;ndash; pAraskara of SYV tradition. Thus, the form tryambaka is one with the 3 goddesses. The association of rudra with a group of goddesses is also alluded to in the shatarudrIya and the AV texts. Thus, tryambakA means the one with the 3 goddesses. This triadic structure of the rudrian goddesses continued into the tantras with three bhairavI-s of the trika-kaula stream.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/blog_supplement/status/1714176194709475482&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Take Rudra. There is every good reason to believe that there were at least a few Ṛṣis or their peers &amp;amp; contemporaries who may have genuinely seen him as little more than a wrathful deity who punished wrongdoers by going after their cattle or families. There is no need to be delusional about this. There were also Ṛṣis who started getting “hints” as to Rudra’s transcendental nature even in the Ṛgveda. And a few generations after these great pioneers came that supremely inspired Yajurvedīya hymn, the Śatarudriya, which gives us so many insights into the “Higher” Rudra who pervades all beings &amp;amp; yet pleads to Him to avoid our horses, cows &amp;amp; parents. Then you have the Śvetaśvatara. Rudra is practically identified as the supreme cause of causes &amp;amp; you can AirTags see the seeds of later, highly complex Śaiva metaphysical thought and still we have a prayer to Rudra to not harm our loved ones! Then came the Itihāsas &amp;amp; earlier layers of Purāṇas, where you can see instances of cattle-hurting Rudra/Mahādeva but more often a Rudra who destroys demons while humbling the deities when he needs to. Then we also see him being the one beyond Puruṣa &amp;amp; Prakṛti. Then you get the Siddhānta Āgamas &amp;amp; that last book of the Śivapurāṇa, the Vāyavīya-Sam̐hitā—These reveal the supreme Śiva, who is so astonishingly flawless &amp;amp; perfect &amp;amp; ever beyond the reach of anger &amp;amp; the repository of grace. He feels happy at the happiness of all creatures like a father does. This reminds you of Rudra of Ṛgveda, who is addressed as Bhuvanasya Pitā. The fear-filled prayers come to an end in the Āgamas. - GA&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the correct answer with two further Kashmirian exemplars of the same deity. The one I posted is to my knowledge the 3rd surviving exemplar. The deity is amR^iteshvara-bhairava whose vidyA is taught in the netra-tantra which has a masterly commentary by the Kashmirian mantravAdin kShemarAja, a cousin and student of abhinavagupta.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The consort of the deity is amR^italakShmI or amR^iteshvarI. At one point in time the deity was widely worshipped throughout the Indosphere. It is not commonly known that the so-called mahAlakShmI at Kolhapur in Mh was actually amR^italakShmI worshipped along with the amR^iteshvara-bhairava who was installed in the nearby mahAshmashAna. This is confirmed in the inscription of bhoja-shilahara.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
