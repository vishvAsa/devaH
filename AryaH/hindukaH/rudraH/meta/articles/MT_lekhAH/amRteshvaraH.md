This is the correct answer with two further Kashmirian exemplars of the same deity. The one I posted is to my knowledge the 3rd surviving exemplar. The deity is amR^iteshvara-bhairava whose vidyA is taught in the netra-tantra which has a masterly commentary by the Kashmirian mantravAdin kShemarAja, a cousin and student of abhinavagupta. 

The consort of the deity is amR^italakShmI or amR^iteshvarI. At one point in time the deity was widely worshipped throughout the Indosphere. It is not commonly known that the so-called mahAlakShmI at Kolhapur in Mh was actually amR^italakShmI worshipped along with the amR^iteshvara-bhairava who was installed in the nearby mahAshmashAna. This is confirmed in the inscription of bhoja-shilahara. 

But Kashmirians used to make these icons like the one posted and those of @RangaTheDude for household worship with eyes specifically inlayed with silver to indicate the link to the netratantra. They commonly receited the amR^iteshvara-mahimna-stotra routinely which illustrates deep penetration of this shaiva tradition into daily worship in K. 

Odishans OTH seem to have retained the cremation ground rituals pertaining to this bhairava.
