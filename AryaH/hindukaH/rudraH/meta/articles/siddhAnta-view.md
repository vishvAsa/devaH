Śrīkaṇṭharudra is the Rudra in Rudraloka at top of the Brahmāṇḍa & descends to Kailāśa to bless us. He is the Rudra you see in Purāṇa stories & is distinct from Paramaśiva, who operates through Śrīkaṇṭharudra in this world for the sake of bonded souls like us.

Those who have read my tweets regarding the distinction between Paramaśiva & Śrīkaṇṭha will know that I always attribute the literal acts to Śrīkaṇṭha & never Paramaśiva. This is not spelt out as a principle in Siddhānta texts but I had surmised from my reading of the same. I was pleasantly surprised to come across some Ślokas in the Śivapurāṇa which corroborate the same idea. Best part is that I wasn’t remotely looking for such verses. The Ślokas are given in the next tweet.

I’m still very surprised that my particular formulation of the relationship between Paramaśiva and Śrīkaṇṭha (where former acts through latter) was already given in the Śivapurāṇa. It’s a good proof of how well you are able to derive simple conclusions from “first principles”. At the same time, it shows how Śāstra is a great medium through which Bhagavān manifests His presence.

One could say there is a strand of this permeating a lot of shaiva thought probably ultimately rooted in the atimArga. The archaic skandapurANa also presents the view that shiva does not directly act only via agents. The shakti-para streams of the bhairava-srotas/kaula present shiva as the substratum from which the universe arises by the waves of shakti-s  -- like in the vIrUpAkSha-pa~nchAshika. Also saundaryalahari  verse jagat sUte dhAtA... (shakti-para perspective though).
