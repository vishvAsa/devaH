## raudra prAyashchitta
> Mānava-Śrautasūtra 11.7.3.6 (Rudrajapa; cf. nn. 46; 68 above) snānatarpaṇajapahomarcanarato yaḥ samvatsare japet/ sa daśāphalam āpnoti brahmaghno 'tiviśudhyati / surāpaḥ suvarṇahartā goghno vā vṛṣalipatiḥ/
mucyate sarvapāpebhyo rudralokam sa gacchati //

> If one, being devoted to the bathing, the satiating, the murmuring, the offerings, and the praising, murmurs [the prayers to Rudra] for a year, he obtains the gain of his condition of life. [Even] the murderer of a Brāhmaṇa is purified; or the drinker of the Sura, the thief of gold, the murderer of cows, or the husband of a Śūdra woman [is purified]. He is freed from all sins. He goes to the world of Rudra.
