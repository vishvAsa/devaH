A humorous shArdulavikrIDita of tu~Nga indicating the presence of charchikA in rudra's retinue -

> चर्चायाः कथम् एष रक्षति सदा सद्यो नृ-मुण्ड-स्रजं  
> चण्डी-केशरिणो वृषं च भुजगान् सूनोर् मयूराद् अपि ।  
> इत्य् अन्तः परिभावयन् भगवतो दीर्घं धियः कौशलं ।  
> कूष्माण्डो धृति-संभृताम् अनुदिनं पुष्णाति तुन्द-श्रियम् ॥ 
> 
> How does he ever protect his garland of fresh human heads from Carcā? Also his bull from Candi's lion and his snakes from his son's peacock? Thus, wondering to himself about the lord's deep mental skill KūşmāņDa daily nourishes the growing satisfaction of his belly's corpulence.

## kUShmANDa
kUShmANDa is what in english could be called a hobgoblin in rudra's retinue. One could say it is the same since the name is in the singular rather than like say kUShmANDa-gaNa of the shiva-kavacham.

I just recalled above mention by abhinavagupta. kuShmaNDa rudra is associated with hATakeshvara ( rudra of the netherworld) are active at the time of the pralaya. There is a siddhAnta text that the kashmirian kaula-s mention elsewhere as connecting hATakesha and kuShmANDa -- will have to dig it up unless you recall it.
