Let us be clear here. I hate discussing this subject (since it tends to attract gutter scums) but the abuse isn’t pointing out phallic symbolism of Śivaliṅga. Not at all. The abuse is to demean liṅga due to said phallic significance. And how we respond is absolutely important. Hindus should recall how when Xtians & others used to taunt us about our divine multiplicity, we were embarrassed & defensive & wanted to be known as monotheists. Today, the situation has improved with more Hindus being more confident of the word, “polytheism”. Likewise here.

What is embarrassing about the phallic significance of the Śivaliṅga? People keep repeating verses praising the head & feet of the deva but get disgusted at a symbol that connotes what? The eternal fatherhood & motherhood of Śiva & his inseparable Śakti. I don’t care if getting defensive about the phallic significance is the politically “right” stance to take as per the prude-tva consensus. I am & will be a Śaiva till my last breath & will never be apologetic for the phallic significance of the Śivaliṅga. Those who dislike me for this can go ahead & unfollow. I don’t care for such immature folks. 

I care for the opinion of Śrī-Upamanyu-Ṛṣi who states in Mahābhārata that Śiva-Devī are the only deities whose signs/insignia are found on the very persons of all humans & even beasts. (The relevant श्लोक-s from महाभारत; uttered by भगवान्-उपमन्यु to शिव in te guise of देवेन्द्र. It is a very very straightforward passage.) Those who are squeamish about Śivaliṅga & Yoni; take a hike & don’t ever pollute my TL with anti-Śaiva filth disguised as “defence” of Hindudharma. If you are ashamed of the obvious significance of the Liṅga stated in so many śāstra-s & keep privileging your own biases even after being educated wth better-informed opinions, you are a Śivadveṣī.

The eternal unity of Śiva & Śakti symbolized through Sadāśiva’s form as liṅga & yoni in our Temples is not a joke or an object of ridicule to be ashamed of. Those in the know will appreciate that the imagery of a man & woman in intimate embrace is used for ParaBrahma even in the Upaniṣad. The Śaiva śāstras have encapsulated the most profound meanings in the image of liṅga & yoni. The Śivaliṅga has been an object of hate for some “Hindus”. For a Long time, some “Hindu” individuals have shown that they can treat Christians with far more respect than fellow Āstikas.

An example: See the lovely garland of adjectives (Low, unworthy, debased) for Phallic liṅga & the relatively far far more respectful comparison (“Even more immaculate”, meaning this Hindu author still accepts Jeebus as immaculate) with Shittianity. The dasyusamāj condescension for the Liṅga is pretty much along similar lines. There is no doubt we will continue to have imbeciles like this in our ranks for the years to come. I only hope better Hindus don’t get ashamed or defensive about the Śivaliṅga & Yonī.
