## Incorporeality
What kind of face has 3 eyes? What kind of body has more than 2 arms? Li·πÖga is no ordinary human body part. While ≈öiva in ≈öaivam does not have any body or form, he assumes forms for our sake & Li·πÖga has a phallic significance & scriptures have explained its deep meaning too.

## Upamanyu's passage
I care for the opinion of ≈örƒ´-Upamanyu-·πö·π£i who states in MahƒÅbhƒÅrata that ≈öiva-Devƒ´ are the only deities whose signs/insignia are found on the very persons of all humans & even beasts. (The relevant ‡§∂‡•ç‡§≤‡•ã‡§ï-s from ‡§Æ‡§π‡§æ‡§≠‡§æ‡§∞‡§§; uttered by ‡§≠‡§ó‡§µ‡§æ‡§®‡•ç-‡§â‡§™‡§Æ‡§®‡•ç‡§Ø‡•Å to ‡§∂‡§ø‡§µ in te guise of ‡§¶‡•á‡§µ‡•á‡§®‡•ç‡§¶‡•ç‡§∞. It is a very very straightforward passage.) 

We have ‡§∂‡•ç‡§≤‡•ã‡§ï-s from the blessed mouth of ‡§â‡§™‡§Æ‡§®‡•ç‡§Ø‡•Å-‡§ã‡§∑‡§ø, the best among the ‡§≠‡§ï‡•ç‡§§-s of ‡§∂‡§ø‡§µ. When ‡§â‡§™‡§Æ‡§®‡•ç‡§Ø‡•Å-‡§ã‡§∑‡§ø sees ‡§∂‡§ø‡§µ in the guise of ‡§á‡§®‡•ç‡§¶‡•ç‡§∞, he explains the greatness of ‡§∂‡§ø‡§µ & from that long & wonderful speech, the following are some ‡§∂‡•ç‡§≤‡•ã‡§ï-s relevant to this thread:

Briefly put:

> Neither lotus-marked (‡§¨‡•ç‡§∞‡§π‡•ç‡§Æ‡§æ‚Äôs sign) nor cakra-marked (‡§µ‡§ø‡§∑‡•ç‡§£‡•Å‚Äôs sign) nor ‡§µ‡§ú‡•ç‡§∞-marked (‡§á‡§®‡•ç‡§¶‡•ç‡§∞‚Äôs sign) there are from these devas. But the mark of a ‡§≤‡§ø‡§ô‡•ç‡§ó & mark of ‡§≠‡§ó‡§æ are there; thus all creatures are the offspring of ‡§∂‡§ø‡§µ & ‡§¶‡•á‡§µ‡•Ä.

So, who here thinks that they are higher than ‡§â‡§™‡§Æ‡§®‡•ç‡§Ø‡•Å-‡§ã‡§∑‡§ø in authority? This is from the ‡§Æ‡§π‡§æ‡§≠‡§æ‡§∞‡§§ for those who didn‚Äôt infer it from the verse numbering. ‡§Ö‡§®‡•Å‡§∂‡§æ‡§∏‡§®-‡§™‡§∞‡•ç‡§µ has a wonderful portion where ‡§â‡§™‡§Æ‡§®‡•ç‡§Ø‡•Å goes deep into the profound mystery of ‡§∂‡§ø‡§µ.


## Revered imagery
On what linga should remind us, see [note on siddhAnta-view](/AgamaH_shaivaH/siddhAntaH/articles/GA/on_jIvas/).

The eternal unity of ≈öiva & ≈öakti symbolized through SadƒÅ≈õiva‚Äôs form as li·πÖga & yoni in our Temples is not a joke or an object of ridicule to be ashamed of. 

Those in the know will appreciate that the imagery of a man & woman in intimate embrace is used for ParaBrahma even in the Upani·π£ad. The ≈öaiva ≈õƒÅstras have encapsulated the most profound meanings in the image of li·πÖga & yoni. 


## Fatherhood
Source: [TW](https://en.rattibha.com/thread/1309097660197023744)

I really struggle to get what is so shameful about the phallus. Feet of a deva represents his being the refuge of all. His face is his eternal beauty. His arms represents his various powers. Like that, the phallus represents his eternal fatherhood in respect of all beings. Grow up already. It‚Äôs getting beyond annoying.

## Phallic connection
There are several types of ‡§≤‡§ø‡§ô‡•ç‡§ó-s with variations in shape. 

The root imagery is phallic. ‡§â‡§™‡§Æ‡§®‡•ç‡§Ø‡•Å-‡§ã‡§∑‡§ø explicitly recognizes it. ‡§™‡•Å‡§∞‡§æ‡§£-s have stories on phallic aspect. ‡§ï‡§æ‡§Æ‡§ø‡§ï‡§æ‡§ó‡§Æ explicitly hails ‡§∂‡§ô‡•ç‡§ï‡§∞ as being in the form of a ‡§≤‡§ø‡§ô‡•ç‡§ó & ‡§â‡§Æ‡§æ being in the form of a ‡§≠‡§ó‡§æ. With so many obvious pointers, your being disturbed by the all-too-obvious significance of the ‡§≤‡§ø‡§ô‡•ç‡§ó is not my burden to bear. 

Also, I never said that the phallus is the only meaning of the word, "‡§≤‡§ø‡§ô‡•ç‡§ó". I am saying that the phallic imagery is obvious & is deeply related to the inner meanings explained above. Learn to read before responding. 

Ok, a final clarification since some people are persistently dense.

1. I am not saying that shiva has an actual body and that the li~Nga is an actual organ of a god.
2. I am not saying that the word, "li~Nga" means only the phallus.++
3. I am not saying that the li~Nga-yoni has only one meaning.
4. What I am saying is that the "imagery" of the li~Nga-yoni does have a phallic significance.
5. And further, that the li~Nga-yoni also has deeper levels of significance.
6. And that the phallic & philosophical meanings are not unrelated but organically related to one another.
7. And finally that the li~Nga-yoni having a phallic imagery as its basic significance (upon which the deeper meanings are built) is found directly in scripture.


I‚Äôm glad that you liked it üôÇüôèüèæ All credits go to these great teachers who left behind only their wisdom on earth.

There are further profound meanings of the ‡§≤‡§ø‡§ô‡•ç‡§ó, which we will attempt to cover later.

## Apologetics
Let us be clear here. I hate discussing this subject (since it tends to attract gutter scums) but the abuse isn‚Äôt pointing out phallic symbolism of ≈öivali·πÖga. Not at all. The abuse is to demean li·πÖga due to said phallic significance. And how we respond is absolutely important. Hindus should recall how when Xtians & others used to taunt us about our divine multiplicity, we were embarrassed & defensive & wanted to be known as monotheists. Today, the situation has improved with more Hindus being more confident of the word, ‚Äúpolytheism‚Äù. Likewise here.

### Nothing embarassing
What is embarrassing about the phallic significance of the ≈öivali·πÖga? People keep repeating verses praising the head & feet of the deva but get disgusted at a symbol that connotes what? The eternal fatherhood & motherhood of ≈öiva & his inseparable ≈öakti. I don‚Äôt care if getting defensive about the phallic significance is the politically ‚Äúright‚Äù stance to take as per the prude-tva consensus. I am & will be a ≈öaiva till my last breath & will never be apologetic for the phallic significance of the ≈öivali·πÖga. 


### Immature hatred
The ≈öivali·πÖga has been an object of hate for some ‚ÄúHindus‚Äù. For a Long time, some ‚ÄúHindu‚Äù individuals have shown that they can treat Christians with far more respect than fellow ƒÄstikas.

An example: See the lovely garland of adjectives (Low, unworthy, debased) for Phallic li·πÖga & the relatively far far more respectful comparison (‚ÄúEven more immaculate‚Äù, meaning this Hindu author still accepts Jeebus as immaculate) with Shittianity. The dasyusamƒÅj condescension for the Li·πÖga is pretty much along similar lines. There is no doubt we will continue to have imbeciles like this in our ranks for the years to come. I only hope better Hindus don‚Äôt get ashamed or defensive about the ≈öivali·πÖga & Yonƒ´.

### Rejection
Those who dislike me for this can go ahead & unfollow. I don‚Äôt care for such immature folks.

Those who are squeamish about ≈öivali·πÖga & Yoni; take a hike & don‚Äôt ever pollute my TL with anti-≈öaiva filth disguised as ‚Äúdefence‚Äù of Hindudharma. If you are ashamed of the obvious significance of the Li·πÖga stated in so many ≈õƒÅstra-s & keep privileging your own biases even after being educated wth better-informed opinions, you are a ≈öivadve·π£ƒ´.
