- "Further, this sūkta mentions our ancient ancestor Cyavāna as the one who had measured out the vedi for the for the Aśvin-s. Cyavāna is mentioned in tradition as the one who instituted the rite where soma is offered to the Aśvin-s. Indeed, in the above ṛk it appears that Kakṣīvān seeks Indra permission for the same as there are indications from later narratives that Indra was not entirely on board with that."

### रुद्रसम्बन्धः
> "The ancient name of the Aśvin-s is Divo Napatā. The twin sons of Dyaus. This is an equivalent of the name of their Greek cognates the Dioskouroi (the national deities of the Spartans), meaning the youths of Zeus (the cognate of Dyaus; Skt Divaḥ Kumārau) or their Lithuanian cognates Dievo Suneliai (Sons of Dieva = Dyaus).

दिवः पतिस् तु रुद्रो भाति बहुत्र (" indrota tubhyaṃ tad dive tad rudrāya svayaśase | (RV 1.129.3)")। तेनेतौ रुद्राव् इत्यप्युक्तम् - "uta tyā me raudrāv"। 

> Their “Raudra nature” is clearly brought out in the ṛk RV 10.93.7: uta no rudrā cin mṛḻatām aśvinā : Also, though being Rudra-s, may the Aśvin-s be merciful. ... Consistent with this, they share their medical prowess with Rudra (as physicians of the gods) and even more tellingly also their knowledge of poisons with Rudra. - MT

- भवशर्वाभ्यां सह सम्बन्धस्योह उपर्युक्तो रुद्रविभागे।

> " it is plausible that the term Rudravartanī and the association of the Aśvin-s with Rudra have an astronomical significance. In the classic nakṣatra system that developed by the time of the AV and the YV the Aśvin-s are associated with the constellation of Aśvayujau which corresponds to part of Aries. However, the obvious constellation that resembles the divine twins is Gemini, which was recognized as the Dioscuri in the Greek tradition. ... a potential connection is seen in RV 10.39.11 where the Aśvin-s are called Rudravartanī and explicitly linked Aditi ... O Aśvins, you who are easy to invoke, follow the track of Rudra. "
