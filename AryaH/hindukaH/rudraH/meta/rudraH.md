## यमलत्वं क्वचित्
> One of the notable aspects differentiating the early Atharvaṇ tradition from the RV tradition with regard to Rudra is the use of the twin appellation Bhavā-Śarvā for the deity in the former. These names of Rudra also persist in the ādhvaryava tradition preserved in the Yajurveda-s but the twinning is less prominent relative the AV tradition. Notably, in the celebrated Mṛgāreṣṭi ritual the AV tradition features a sūkta to the twin Bhavā-Śarvā whereas in its place the KYV tradition has ṛk-s to the Aśvin-s. This points to two parallel streams within the early Vedic tradition which featured Rudra in singular form (apart from the plurality of the Rudra-class) as seen in the RV or in twin form of Bhavā-Śarvā as seen in the AV. This suggests that the Rudra-class had an ancient intrinsic twin nature shared with the Aśvin-s which lingers in the Bhavā-Śarvā dyad. Notably, even in Greek tradition the deity of the Rudra-class, Apollo is born with twin (albeit female), Artemis. While the RV Aśvin-s are identical twins in character, sometimes, in the IE world one sees some differentiation of the the twins with one of them associated with healing and animal-husbandry and the other with warfare. For example, among the Yavana-s, one of the pair, Castor is a horse-trainer while the other one Polydeuces is a boxer. A similar differentiation is perhaps reflected in the twin Rudra-s, with the name Bhava indicating welfare and health, and the and Śarva meaning and archer and indicating the warrior nature of the second twin. Thus, it is likely that Bhava and Śarva were part of the parallel Vedic tradition where they played the role of the Aśvin-s as twin Rudra-s.

> A later reflex of this twinning in the Rudra-class appears to have emerged via developments in the form of the Kaumāra tradition emerging in the Indo-Iranian borderlands. There we see the dual form of the god Kumāra as Skanda-Viśākha. This dyad is earliest attested in the Atharvavedīya-Skanda-yāga from the AV-pariśiṣṭha-s and has a prolonged presence in the Hindu tradition. The grammarian Patañjali mentions metal images of Rudra along with the Skanda-Viśākha dyad in the Mauryan age (~322-185 BCE).

## लिङ्गम्
- linga can mean both a symbol and a phallus.
- Though to modern devotees, the linga tends to be a symbol of shiva (with no sexual connotations), it had associations with the erect human phallus, representing the yogic Urdhvaretas power and paradoxical fertility of shiva.
    - Eg. the ancient linga at [guDimallam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gudimallam). There are also several images of shiva with an erect phallus.
    - किरातपतेर् ऊर्ध्वरेतस्त्वं यो न जानाति स खलु प्रायेण नावगच्छति लिङ्गस्य स्वारस्यमित्य् अनुमामि। 

> What is embarrassing about the phallic significance of the Śivaliṅga? People keep repeating verses praising the head & feet of the deva but get disgusted at a symbol that connotes what? The eternal fatherhood & motherhood of Śiva & his inseparable Śakti. I don’t care if getting defensive about the phallic significance is the politically “right” stance to take as per the prude-tva consensus. I am & will be a Śaiva till my last breath & will never be apologetic for the phallic significance of the Śivaliṅga. ... I don’t care for such immature folks. I care for the opinion of Śrī-Upamanyu-Ṛṣi who states in Mahābhārata that Śiva-Devī are the only deities whose signs/insignia are found on the very persons of all humans & even beasts.
