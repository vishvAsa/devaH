The preferred order is vasu-s, rudra-s, Aditya-s. 

There is general belief that the vasu-s have a proximal position as the ritual/funerary fire agni -- hence, the nearest ancestor is with them;  
rudra-s are atmospheric in their general stationing. Hence the next closest ancestor is stationed with them.  
The Aditya-s are in the high heavens and thus the farthest ancestor is with them.
