The universal sarasvatI: mAtR^ikA-sarasvatI who is the central deity in one of the peculiar pUrvAmnAya lineages (later incorporated as an a~NgadevatA of kubjikA in the pashchimAmnAya). pUrvAmnAya affiliated KashmIrian v1s do a saMpuTikaraNa of her mantra with the sAvitrI as part of their daily practice.
