The great trans-functional goddess of proto-Indo-European provenance, Sarasvatī.

Several male gods associated with different functions are spanned by a single transfunctional goddess — Sarasvatī. (This pattern is reproduced in the national epic on the earthly plane in the unusual polyandry of the five Pāṇḍava-s to Draupadī.)
