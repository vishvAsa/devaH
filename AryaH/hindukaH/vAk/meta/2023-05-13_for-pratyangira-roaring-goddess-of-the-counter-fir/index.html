For Pratyangira – Roaring Goddess of the Counter-Fire
A murti of the fearsome Goddess[-form], Pratyangira – a theonymic we would be tempted to translate as “Return Fire!”
She is regarded as Goddess of the Atharva Veda via Atharvana Bhadrakali – and also linked to Kali through the Narasimhika (‘Heroic Lioness’ / ‘Lion-(Wo)Man’) encountered in the Sri Kalika Sahasranama stotram of MahaKalaBhairava : and we would also suggest another familiar figure as providing a further direct foundation within the Vedic Samhitas. That being Vak Devi as a Wrathful Lioness, as we hear of in the Taittiriya Samhita and the Shatapatha Brahmana of the Yajurveda.">

</figure>
<p>A murti of the fearsome Goddess[-form], Pratyangira – a theonymic we would be tempted to translate as “Return Fire!”</p>
<p>She is regarded as Goddess of the Atharva Veda via Atharvana Bhadrakali – and also linked to Kali through the Narasimhika (‘Heroic Lioness’ / ‘Lion-(Wo)Man’) encountered in the Sri Kalika Sahasranama stotram of MahaKalaBhairava : and we would also suggest another familiar figure as providing a further direct foundation within the Vedic Samhitas. That being Vak Devi as a Wrathful Lioness, as we hear of in the Taittiriya Samhita and the Shatapatha Brahmana of the Yajurveda.</p>
<p>And more upon Her in due course.</p>
<h2 id="angiras">Angiras</h2>
<p>‘Prati’ (प्रति) as in ‘return’, ‘opposing’, and ‘Angira’ … well, we are translating somewhat figuratively – in-context it is an Atharvanic metaphysical operation (or the practitioner of same); its etymology should seem to ultimately be from PIE *h₁engʷ- (‘fire’, ‘burning’; not coincidentally, as *h₁n̥gʷnís , ‘living fire’ the root for ‘Agni’, ‘Ignition’, etc.) – developed to *h₁óngʷl̥ (’embers’, ‘charcoal’), whence Sanskrit Angara (अङ्गार – also used, for obvious reasons, for the planet Mars) [and c.f. Sayana’s commentary upon RV IV 2 15 wherein अङ्गारा , as in ‘Cinders’, is presented as the origination for *The* Angirasas, the priestly clade].+++(5)+++</p>
<p>It is intriguing, as well, to note the ‘duality’ between the two ‘sides’ to the Atharvangirasa (another name for the AtharvaVeda) – the ‘Atharva’ side in that context being associated with the more ‘beneficent’ styles of operation and intended outcome, the ‘Angirasa’ with .. well .. not that. ‘Ghoram’ – ‘Dread [Magics]’ being the operative labelling.</p>
<p>Which does not mean ‘Unholy’ via implication – we are reminded of the situation encountered in RV X 108 8, wherein Sarama (the Divine Hound), sent off on a mission to recover a lost wealth of cows stolen by the demonic Panis …<br>
threatens the adversaries by saying that<br>
(inferentially) should anything happen to Her (the Panis having just er .. pointedly noted the sharpness of their weapons and the strength of their defences),<br>
then in amidst other clades of ‘combat theologian’ Holy Man (Rsis and Navagvas)<br>
there shall come the unyielding (ayaasya) Angirases.<br>
Which, whilst it <em>could</em> be taken in the conventional sense –<br>
would certainly fit the context for more overt coterminity with ‘Angirasa’ as it pertains to the AV.<br>
Anti-Demon Warding, and all.</p>
<p>As Griffith’s translation to Her Words to the Panis puts it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Then will the Panis wish these [threatening] words unspoken.”</p></blockquote>
<p>But I have digressed somewhat.</p>
<h3 id="atharva">Atharva</h3>
<p>Both ‘Angirasa’ and ‘Atharva’ are, fundamentally, ‘Fire’ terms.<br>
Many are aware of the cognate in the Zoroastrian sphere for the latter – Athravan (‘Priest’ ; Āθravan / Āθrauuan),<br>
however there has been a persistent effort to insist that this ‘must’ be a BMAC origin term rather than something Indo-European<br>
(and frankly, given Pinault’s work in this area also seeking to apportion ‘Sharva’ (Śarva / Ćarwa) to BMAC origination despite eminently viable IE etymology,<br>
seemingly whilst claiming its meaning to be “living in the forest” (assumedly by overreading ‘Hunter’) rather than ‘Injurer / Archer’ (because then we’d have a pretty straightforward IE rooting … “k̂er-4 und k̂erə- : k̂rē-“, as Pokorny puts it for Srnati / शृणाति ) …<br>
well, you can see why I’d be a bit suspicious, even if his suggestion viz. a Tocharian *Athr or ‘Superior Force’ is quite nice) .</p>
<p>To this we would proffer Pokorny’s observation of the relevant terminology as instead deriving from PIE *āt(e)r- … meaning “Fire” – and whence also Serbian ‘Vȁtra’ (Fire), Albanian ‘Vatër’ <em>(</em>[<em>Central</em>] Fire), Latin ‘Āter’ (‘Black(ened)’, as in ‘Burnt’, Black-Wreathed), Proto-Celtic *ātis (‘Oven’, ‘Furnace’) and Irish ‘áith’ (Kiln).</p>
<p>Who also makes an interesting suggestion for the Tocharian A and B ‘Atär’ and ‘Etär’, ostensibly ‘Hero’, as perhaps deriving from same archaic ‘fire’ term via a PIE *ētro, he takes to mean ‘Swift’ (and inferentially, we surmise, ‘Impetuous’, ‘Passionate’ – ‘Hot-Tempered’/’Hot-Headed’/’Hot-Blooded’?) – ref. Latvian ‘ātrs’ and some of its related Baltic ‘tempestuous’ variations , as well as Old High German Ātar (‘Sharp’, ‘Keen’, ‘Quick’, etc.). Perhaps we may also inferentially speculate upon the notion of Agni as Priest (by which I mean the human Priest stepping into the role of Agni – as we shall soon examine an instance of from the Vedic ritual canon), Priest as ‘Fire’, with figurative connexion to this likewise.<br>
Certainly, ‘Vipra’ (cognate with ‘Vibrate’), the empowered quality of a powerful Brahmin,springs to mind.+++(5)+++</p>
<h3 id="atharvangirasa">AtharvAngirasa</h3>
<p>And speaking of speculation linguistic – taking ‘Atharva’ as ‘Fire’ and ‘Angira(sa)’ as ‘Cinders’ (or Embers) ,<br>
we are presented with the interesting contemplation as to ‘Atharvangirasa’ as in both the ‘Beneficent’ and ‘Baleful’ invocations being, perhaps, ‘Fire and Cinders’ itself.<br>
Fire, as in the central and focal, ornate and orthodox, drawing one in to its warmth and life-illumining properties …<br>
Cinders, as the sparks and sooty sprays emittent and emergent from the sacral fire<br>
which billow out to seek their targets and which have that darkened,<br>
miasmatic appearance interspersed with burning.<br>
But that is purely speculative hypothetical upon my part at this odd hour of the morning.</p>
<h2 id="wrathful-lioness">Wrathful lioness</h2>
<p>But let us return to our major (my)theme. We had spoken earlier of Vak Devi – and made mention of the fact of Pratyangira as protective against the cursing forces of those arrayed against the supplicant.</p>
<p>In both the Taittiriya samhita of the Yajurveda and the Shukla-attached Shatapatha Brahmana<br>
we hear of Her in the form of a Wrathful Lioness,<br>
linked quite pointedly with the Altar-Flame elsewhere therein<br>
(hence why the offering is able to reach Her even afore Agni, per
one of the relevant propitiating verses [SBr III 5 1 23 / TS VI 2 7 1; +++(5)+++<br>
repeated quite pointedly in the next SBr occurrence for Her, as well, at III 5 2 9 … because it is through Her that all is (to be made) possible in the first instance] –<br>
a situation that at once reminds one of Hestia of the Hellenics …<br>
or, perhaps, the pre-eminent share of Hekate (of the Three Worlds) granted by Zeus Himself, per Hesiod).</p>
<p>She is invoked twice in each text in this style –
on one occasion [SBr III 5 1 / TS VI 2 7], it is in the context of a Ritual Combat<br>
occurrent between Agni as Priest of the Gods and a Sahasrakshas as Priest of the Demons (Asura-Rakshas here , per the SBr III 5 1 21 account).<br>
She is propitiated and won over via such to the Side of the Gods<br>
(and, assumedly, the human priest acting in Divine Resonancy and Mythic Emulation – Eternal Return, some would term it) –<br>
and by that mechanism are the Gods’ Enemies within this metaphysical combat to be vanquished<br>
(we would surmise both via the ‘Power of Speech’<br>
and Vedic Rites being favourable to the Divine Side …<br>
and not making Herself available to the Adversary).</p>
<p>As SBr III 5 1 33 puts it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Thereupon he shifts (the Earth) asunder, with the text (Vâg. S. V, 10),<br>
‘Thou art a Lioness, overcoming the enemies;<br>
be Thou meet for the Gods!’</p>
<p>Inasmuch as, on that occasion,<br>
She [Vak] became a Lioness and roamed about unappeased,<br>
therefore he says to Her,<br>
‘Thou art a Lioness;’</p>
<p>and by ‘overcoming the enemies’ he means to say,<br>
‘Through Thee may we worst our enemies.’</p>
<p>‘Be Thou meet for the Gods’ he says,<br>
because the High Altar is a Woman:<br>
Her he thus renders meet for the Gods.”<br>
[Eggeling translation]</p></blockquote>
<p>It is not difficult to see how this understanding would align with the later-prominent suite of perceptions<br>
viz. the pointedly leonine-featured Pratyangira.+++(5)+++<br>
Through Her, indeed, one is able to overcome one’s enemies.</p>
<h2 id="enemy-ritual">Enemy ritual</h2>
<p>Just as through Vak,<br>
the Gods (and a supplicant-Priest whether Divine or of more human origination) are able to exercise the requisite metaphysical force to drive back Their foes.<br>
A situation not displaced even via the Taittiriya Samhita’s notation at VI 2 7 4<br>
that the Asuras seeking to assail the Gods<br>
and the sphere of the Rite (c.f. the role of the Angiras to protect the Rite from disruption)<br>
have managed to equip themselves with Vajras –<br>
suggesting, perhaps, that these demons are themselves<br>
quite esoterically capable and therefore doubly underscoring the vital necessity of dealing to them accordingly.+++(5)+++</p>
<h2 id="disposal">Disposal</h2>
<p>Her next arrival within the Yajurvedic ritual conceptry,<br>
at SBr III 5 2 (the Taittiriya Samhita correlate just continues directly on from the previous appearance in the earlier part of TS VI 2 7, unbroken and then immediately on into TS VI 2 8)<br>
is perhaps even more overtly resonant with our prime perception of Pratyangira.</p>
<p>Insofar as it concerns itself directly with the mechanism<br>
via which an enemy of the ritualist <em>himself</em> – say, a Yatudhana – can be hurled screaming into the jaws of the Underworld via Her Grim Grace<br>
[‘Grim’, here, most appropriately, in the archaic Germanic sense entailed via Old Norse ‘Grimmr’ (‘Terrific’, ‘Fierce’, ‘Savage’ – ‘Kruram’ we would say in Sanskrit) – and also the PIE*gʰrem- (‘Roar’, ‘Thunder’) from whence that descends … ].</p>
<p>To quote, first in English and then certain relevant portions of the Sanskrit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The sprinkling-water which is left he pours outside the altar<br>
close to where is the southern of those two front corners (of the high altar) with,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‘This burning water I dismiss from the sacrifice.’</p></blockquote>
<p>Because She (Vâk–the Altar) on that occasion<br>
became a Lioness and roamed about unappeased,<br>
he thus dismisses from the sacrifice that Sorrow of Hers,<br>
–if he do not wish to exorcise.</p>
<p>But should he wish to exorcise,<br>
let him indicate it by saying,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‘This burning water I dismiss from the sacrifice<br>
against so and so!’</p></blockquote>
<p>He then smites him with that sorrow,<br>
and sorrowing he goes to yonder world.”<br>
[III 5 2 8, Eggeling translation]</p></blockquote>
<p>And, to pick up upon some key points of interest from therein …<br>
the Southern / Rightwards (‘Dakshina’) direction of the ritual space is, of course,<br>
oriented toward Yama’s Realm –<br>
hence, in no small part, why the earlier phase of the relevant liturgy has the Pitrs (the Forefathers, the Ancestor-Spirits)<br>
appearing at this Direction in order to protect the Ritualist and his proceedings [III 5 2 5 / TS VI 2 7 5].</p>
<p>The disposition for the Wrathful Vak Lioness as declared here [SBr III 5 2 8] is not adequately conveyed via the English (to the surprise, I surmise, of precisely no-one).<br>
The actual terms are ‘aśānte’ (‘Opposite-to-Shanti’ – opposite to ‘peaceful / tranquil’, that is to say, ‘wild’, ‘restless’, ‘violent’, ‘furor-‘)<br>
and elements of ‘śuc’; the latter of which having, as I phrased it elsewhere, an effective sense that is eminently … funerary.</p>
<p>To quote myself:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“शुच् (‘Shuc’), its root, refers at once to ‘grieving’, ‘mourning’, ‘being in a state of clear (and loud) emotional distress’ …<br>
and yet also to ‘burning’, ‘consuming’, and to the gleaming, shining, radiance of fire.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Or, in other words, She being rather ‘upset’ (to put it … mildly)<br>
means somebody is about to end up <em>On Fire</em>,<br>
and/or otherwise in tearful pain. Seriously.<br>
That’s expressly what the term is used to mean (inter alia) in various of these Vedic contexts.</p>
<p>Oh, and in later texts (and, for that matter, the steadily repeated refrain within RV I 97 – ‘apa naḥ śośucad agham’), ‘to purify’. Flame, after all, is the great cleanser !</p>
<p>Handy that we have the ‘Flame (Atharva) Veda’ on hand, then, isn’t it.</p>
<p>As for the term which Eggeling has (understandably – if a little unconventionally,<br>
perhaps, relative to how we usually might think of the term)<br>
chosen to render as ‘exorcise’ –<br>
well, we do not intend to go through particle-by-particle<br>
that delicious phrase ‘abhicared ādiśed idam ahaṃ’ herein for … several reasons.</p>
<p>To return to the Taittiriya Samhita rendition for the rite,<br>
it differs in one key respect from the Shatapatha Brahmana iteration –<br>
and which just so happens to be quite pertinent for our cause of Pratyangira evocation herein.</p>
<p>As the Keith translation puts it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“In that he sprinkles the high altar,<br>
verily thus does the sacrificer repel his foes from the quarters.<br>
Indra gave the Yatis to the Salavrkas;<br>
them they ate on the right of the high altar.<br>
Whatever is left of the sprinkling waters<br>
he should pour on the right of the high altar;<br>
whatever cruel is there that he appeases thereby.<br>
He should think of whomever he hates;<br>
verily he brings affliction upon him.”<br>
[TS VI 2 7 5]</p></blockquote>
<p>Now, as we can see,<br>
the <em>broad</em> outlines to the ritual operation in question<br>
are clearly coterminous with that<br>
we have already beheld at SBr III 5 2 8<br>
(and I have chosen not to revisit the invocations for the Guardians of the Directions in both versions<br>
which immediately precede this occurrence.<br>
Suffice to say they are, again,<br>
substantively the same in each iteration –<br>
and with the ‘Swift-of-Mind’ (‘Swift-as-a-Thought’?), Manojavah,<br>
taken by Sayana as Lord Yama Himself,<br>
accompanied by the Pitrsat the Right / South for both).</p>
<h2 id="bad-yati-s">Bad yati-s</h2>
<p>Yet within this framework<br>
we also have Indra dispatching a group called the Yatins<br>
by quite literally ‘throwing them to the Wolves’<br>
[I choose to render ‘Salavrka’ in the obvious fashion<br>
in light of broader IE evidence for such a clade:<br>
as ‘Temple Wolves’ (strictly speaking, ‘Shalavrkas’ –<br>
in singular and with proper textual accenting, Śālāvṛka / शालावृक ) or ‘Wolves of the [Ritual] Enclosure’ (Sālāvṛka /सालावृक );+++(5)+++<br>
later era texts and academic analysis have made rather curious shifts to ‘Hyenas’ or ‘Jackals’, however].</p>
<p>Who are these Yatins ?<br>
Well, that <em>is</em> a bit of a question.</p>
<p>Ordinarily, the term would refer to<br>
somebody of spiritual / metaphysical accomplishment –<br>
perhaps an ascetic, a renunciate, as in later usage.<br>
This has been seized upon by some modern commentators<br>
to try and make out that Indra’s hurling of the Yatis to the Wolves<br>
was some sort of woefully egregious misdeed.<br>
Certainly, that is the temptation<br>
when one encounters the incident cited in Aitareya Brahmana VII 28<br>
as part of the ‘rap sheet’ (“a formal indictment, as it were […] drawn up against Indra”, per Oertel)<br>
of divinely noted misdeeds of Indra<br>
that have lead to His being excluded from the Soma sacrifice.+++(4)+++</p>
<p>Yet such an interpretation makes little sense.<br>
At least for this specific context.<br>
Pious and morally blameless ascetics being killed</p>
<p>do not merit a rather broad array of citations in amidst a God’s victory-lists in the Shruti –<br>
wherein they are pointedly situated+++(5)+++<br>
alongside other rather more+++(4)+++<br>
well-remarked upon threats<br>
such as that demon-dragons of the waters, Vritra and Vala (c.f. AV-S II 5 3; Samaveda II 3 1 12 3), and with Bhrigu carrying out a ‘resonant’+++(5)+++ deed,<br>
likewise (A Priest, a Rsi co-enacting the mythic fight of the God against Demon –  ) rather on-point, you would have to say for the circumstance of TS VI  2 7 / SBr III 5 1 &amp; 2 all up) .<br>
We would also be rather surprised<br>
if something which was so <em>wrong</em><br>
was therefore to be directly invoked <em>in</em> the relevant Taittiriya Samhita ritual operation<br>
<em>as</em> just exactly what the properly pious Brahminical operator himself ought to thusly engage in.+++(4)+++</p>
<p>That said, the Aitareya Brahmana’spresentation<br>
does make logical sense in another fashion.<br>
By situating the Yatins alongside Vishvarupa (Trisiras) and Vritra –<br>
we are obviously invited to remember the unifying characteristic of these other two,<br>
that had indeed sent Indra into sin-stained exile for a time.+++(4)+++<br>
They were <em>Brahmins</em> –<br>
and hence Indra’s (necessary, at least quite unambiguously as applies Vritra) slaying of these<br>
had incurred the sin-sanction of the Brahmahatya :<br>
the dread sin of Brahmanicide.<br>
This would certainly seem the sort of thing<br>
which, due to the ritual impurity<br>
thusly accrued from <em>all</em> of these deeds together<br>
<em>plus</em> another exterminating another clade (the Arurmaghas) –<br>
occasionally seemingly identified with or coterminous to the Yatis<br>
(as in Indra’s bold declaration at Kaushitaki Upanishad III, occasionally not),<br>
<em>and</em> perhaps most importantly, actively disrespecting His Own Guru, Brihaspati … well, we see how it goes.<br>
And it is important to note that ‘ritual impurity’<br>
is not <em>quite</em> the same thing as moral turpitude.+++(5)+++<br>
Hence our lack of surprise when the sins are expiated [c.f. Jaminiya Brahmana II 134]<br>
and Indra is able to return once more to the Divine Fold proper in earnest.</p>
<p>My suspicions appear confirmed in the Tandya Mahabrahmana (XIV 11 28),<br>
where Indra’s slaying of the Yatis is indeed said to have accrued Him<br>
an (expiatable) ritual impurity –<br>
with, more interestingly, the commentator directly having the sin in question declared to be Brahmanicide.<br>
Although curiously, the same source then goes on to emphatically declare the Yatis<br>
as having “practised observances contrary to the Veda”[Tandya Br. viii 1 4, Muir translation],<br>
to be “hostile to sacrifices”[ibid., xiii 4 27] and also against “rites”[ibid., xiv 11 28],<br>
yet also being “Brahmans who did not celebrate the jyotishtoma and other sacrifices, but lived in another way.” [ibid., xviii 1 9]+++(5)+++</p>
<p>Sayana, meanwhile, declares the Yatis to be “Asuras in the disguise of [Yatis]”+++(5)+++<br>
and the aforementioned Arurmaghas (elsewhere – ‘Arunmukhas’, apparently) to be “Asuras in the form [‘disguise’, per Haug] of Brahmans”,<br>
per his commentary upon Ait. Br. VII 28;<br>
Haug also notes Sankara Acharya’s Kaushitaki Upanishad commentary<br>
as parsing “Arunmukhas” as “in whose mouth is not the study of the Vedas”,<br>
with Haug’s inference being that these Arurmaghas “were no doubt a kind of degraded Aryas,<br>
very likely a tribe of the ancient Iranians, in whose language (the Zend)<br>
the words aurvo and magha are frequently to be met with”. +++(4)+++</p>
<p>Perhaps surprisingly to some corners of our audience given my recurrent sentiments in relation to Zoroastrianism …<br>
I do not share his view.<br>
At least, not axiomatically.<br>
It would be tempting to speculate that the ‘Ashemaoghas’ mentioned in the Avestan texts (ref. Vendidad Fargard 18 I 11), for example,<br>
may bear some coterminity in this direction –<br>
but that is not our purpose to get into herein.</p>
<p>The semi-conflation of the Arurmaghas / Arunmukhas with the Yatis instead suggests that<br>
these are, at least in ritual invocation of the sort and style that we have above discussed,<br>
intended as an ‘enemy’ clade.<br>
And the characteristics that we are able to piece together for these<br>
should seem to have them as something along the lines of an ‘enemy caster’, or a ‘dark (even ‘inverse’) equivalent’ to the Brahmins doing the proper-and-pious invoking.+++(4)+++<br>
In just the same manner as Agni fights via prayerful operation, a Priest of the Demons, at various points in the SBr ritual manuals (ref. SBr III 5 1 21 , etc.).<br>
Hence, as Sayana had it – ‘Asuras in Brahmin form’.</p>
<p>Or, perhaps more interestingly, perhaps,<br>
something more akin to our understanding for Yatudhana – ‘Sorcerer’,<br>
albeit with potency gained via making offerings to enlisted Demons.<br>
As that is the reasonably direct meaning for ‘Yatudhana’ –<br>
One who feeds / gives offering (‘dhaana’ / dhāna /धान) to the Yatus (Yātu /यातु – in this context ‘Those Who Go [through the air?]’,<br>
and intended to refer to the Demons bound by the spells of the miscreant<br>
metaphysically empowered villain encountered herein).</p>
<p>As it happens, Yati / Yatin appears to actually share an etymological root with ‘Yatu’;<br>
although it is a little unclear as to just how ‘close’ the relationship might truly have been intended to be.<br>
Given later texts upon the subject,<br>
I do not think that the Yatis/ Yatins were intended in this context<br>
to be the demons <em>themselves</em> (insofar as it matters) –<br>
but rather, humans making active use of them in the course of their own ritual ensorcellments.</p>
<p>To quote myself upon the subject as to their essential nature:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Later scripture should seem to present these ‘Yatins’ in a rather interesting manner –<br>
effectively suggesting these to be almost ‘priestly’ sorts …<br>
certainly capable of carrying out rites,<br>
however hopelessly in league with Demons<br>
and in arrogant opposition to the Gods.<br>
Indeed, in at least one telling they (or the forces they are aligned with)<br>
even have had the temerity to attempt to steal the Wife of the Sacrificer (Man – or, more directly, Manu)<br>
via a mentally afflicting “influence”.<br>
Thus necessitating the enlisted aid of Indra in order to smash both the scurrilous mind-ensnaring enchantment and its would-be beneficiaries. By feeding them to the Wolves!”</p></blockquote>
<h2 id="pratyangira">Pratyangira</h2>
<p>This is, then, quite pertinent for our contemplation of the Vedic resonation of Pratyangira –<br>
as She is called upon in order to deflect the dark enchantments<br>
and malefic efforts to be unleashed by such sorts against the pious devotee, the <em>proper</em> priestly invoker.+++(5)+++</p>
<p>And also through Her that<br>
various great boons may be bestowed,<br>
particularly those which the demons and demon-worshippers might have sought to interfere with.</p>
<p>To quote from the Taittiriya Samhita in relation to Vak as Lioness (i.e. not Praytangira<em>directly</em> – but quite resonantly therewith, all the same):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The High Altar [Vak] said,<br>
‘Through Me Ye shall obtain all Your desires.’<br>
The Gods desired, ‘Let Us overcome the Asuras Our foes.’<br>
They sacrificed (with the words),’Thou Art a Lioness, overcoming rivals; Hail!’<br>
They over came the Asuras, Their foes.<br>
Having overcome the Asuras, Their foes,<br>
They felt desire, ‘May We obtain Offspring.’<br>
They Sacrificed (with the words), ‘Thou Art a Lioness, bestowing fair offspring, Hail!’<br>
They obtained offspring.<br>
They having obtained offspring felt desire, ‘May We obtain cattle.’<br>
They Sacrificed (with the words), ‘Thou Art a Lioness, bestowing increase of wealth; Hail!’<br>
They obtained cattle. Having obtained cattle, They felt desire, ‘May We obtain support.’<br>
They Sacrificed (with the words), ‘Thou Art a Lioness, winning (the favour of) the Adityas; Hail!’<br>
They found support here. Having found support here, They felt desire, ‘May We approach the Deities for Blessings.’<br>
They Sacrificed (with the words), ‘Thou Art a Lioness; bring the Gods to the Pious sacrificer; Hail!&rsquo;”<br>
[TS VI 2 8, Keith translation]</p></blockquote>
<p>The equivalent verses of the SBr are to be found at III 5 2 9-13.</p>
<h2 id="burning">Burning</h2>
<p>Oh, and as for what shall happen to those thrice-accursed demon-worshippers?</p>
<p>Their flame shall burn but … briefly.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The sprinkling-water which is left he pours outside the altar close to where is the southern of those two front corners (of the high altar) with,<br>
‘This burning water I dismiss from the sacrifice.’<br>
Because She (Vâk–the Altar) on that occasion became a Lioness and roamed about unappeased,<br>
he thus dismisses from the sacrifice that Sorrow of Hers,–if he do not wish to exorcise.<br>
But should he wish to exorcise, let him indicate it by saying,<br>
‘This burning water I dismiss from the sacrifice against so and so!’<br>
He then smites him with that sorrow, and sorrowing he goes to yonder world.”<br>
[III 5 2 8, Eggeling translation]</p></blockquote>
<p>Or, from the Taittiriya Samhita:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“In that he sprinkles the high altar,<br>
verily thus does the sacrificer repel his foes from the quarters.<br>
Indra gave the Yatis to the Salavrkas; them they ate on the right of the high altar.<br>
Whatever is left of the sprinkling waters he should pour on the right of the High Altar;<br>
whatever Cruel is there that he appeases thereby.<br>
He should think of whomever he hates; verily he brings affliction upon him.”<br>
[TS VI 2 7, Keith translation]</p></blockquote>
<p>To quote from an earlier piece of mine, aptly enough (given the Pratyangira – BhadraKali co-identification often encountered) on Kali :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Yet where we took things next was to observe the situation identified in those Yajurvedic Rites,<br>
wherein the Baleful, Burning, Furious and Roaring Form of the Goddess was invoked<br>
in order to devour an invidious opponent.<br>
With, entirely uncoincidentally, Her being Called Forth from the Southern vector that also constitutes the Pathway into the Realms of the Dead –<br>
the fire-shrouded Gates of the Underworld Themselves.</p></blockquote>
<h2 id="salavrkas-and-pitrs">Salavrkas and Pitrs</h2>
<p>This is also where we had earlier met the Salavrkas [‘Temple Wolves’, ‘Wolves of the Enclosure’], and alongside Them, the Pitrs [‘Forefathers’ – Shades of the Ancestors].<br>
The former mentioned explicitly there alongside “That Which Is Cruel (‘Krura’)” in the Taittiriya Samhita<br>
and engaged in the victorious devouring of the Yatis (‘Sorcerers’, ‘Demon-Worshippers’)<br>
that are the enemy of both Gods and Priest (and His Wife, whether She knows it at that point or otherwise) –<br>
whilst it is Vak in the form of an enraged Lioness<br>
Who comes surging forth to annihilate the adversary in the Shatapatha Brahmana’s perspective upon the same ritual conceptry.”</p>
<h2 id="kruram">Kruram</h2>
<p>And, to speak to ‘Kruram’ itself (the term utilized in the afore-quoted TS verse):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“PIE *kruh₂rós (‘Bloody’), [informs] both Sanskrit ‘Krura’ ( क्रूर ), as well as modern English ‘Cruel’.</p></blockquote>
<p>Indeed, the Sanskrit is (as we have come to anticipate), rather more expansive in its field of definition –<br>
encompassing not only ‘Cruel’ and ‘Bloody, but also ‘Wrathful’, ‘Pitiless’, ‘Savage’, ‘Formidable’, ‘Frightful’, ‘Violent’, ‘Aggressive’, ‘Harsh’, and rather ‘Barbaric’.</p>
<p>Fitting, one would have to say,<br>
for the quite literally ‘Terrific’ (for They beget Terror) facings to Deifics such as Rudra – and, of course, His Wife.<br>
Who is quite directly hailed as ‘Krura’ (or ‘Krurayai’) in various scripture oriented toward Her (see, for instance, Agni Purana 146; Devi Bhagavata Purana VIII 24; and, of course, the famed Sri Durga Ashtottara Shatanama Stotram [‘Great Durga 108 Name Hymnal’] and in similar fashion in the Kalika Sahasranama Stotram – in both the latter instances, occurring in sequence to read ‘Ameya Vikrama Krura’ … Limitless (Ameya) Power / Valour / Heroism (Vikrama) – and, we may infer, also ‘Krura’-quality : judiciously meted out towards the justly-reviled foe).</p>
<p>Given the context, we are also reminded of the invocation of ‘Krura’ in Krishna Yajurveda VI 2 7 in relation to the (howling) demesne that is as the Gates of the Underworld and the Dominion of the Pitrs [‘Ancestors’ – ‘Pitr’ is a cognate for [Fore]Father] under the command of the ‘Manojavah’ (‘Swift-As-Thought’) that is Death.</p>
<h2 id="krura-s">krUra-s</h2>
<p>There, the Salavrkas [‘Temple-Wolves’, or ‘Wolves of the Boundary’] and the Ancestors (with which the Wolves may be co-expressive/co-identifiable)<br>
are called upon to devour the malign Yatis (‘Sorcerers’, ‘Demon-Worshippers’ – adversaries to the Gods and troublers of the religion)<br>
that might seek to intrude upon and disrupt the rites of the pious … in particular, in later scripture, via stealing the Wife of the Priest via subjecting His Beloved to a pernicious mental “influence”.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the Shatapatha Brahmana version of the same rite [SBr III 5 2] has,<br>
in the place of this invocation to the Salavrkas, the saliency for Vak Devi in Wrathful, Devouring (indeed, Lioness) form.<br>
We would suggest that the Goddess becoming Furious, Terrifying, and with the razor-inescapable Maw (and Roar) of a (female) Lion …<br>
has clear ‘resonancy’ for our perspective upon Kali Devi.”</p>
<p>And also, viz. a Lioness – well, as you can see, Pratyangira, Herself !</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Whether in Protection of that Demesne that is (of) Her when threatened directly;<br>
in forceful, intimidatory warding against the would-be violator or stealer of same;<br>
to <em>Remind</em>, where She has (seemingly) been Forgotten, just who and what We are;<br>
and, of course, in Far-Working (ἑκάεργος – or, perhaps, more (three) pointedly, ἑκατηβόλος) retribution and ultimate restoration should the former scenario of co-option have come to horrendous pass.</p></blockquote>
<p>So, to speak towards that ‘Kruram’ quality on grievous (as well as ‘Grave’) display when She is roused to Wrath – and with it, Wrack and Ruin :</p>
<p>We can hardly do better than to quote the last few lines (in Griffith translation) of the Atharva Veda (Śaunakīya)’s Hymn XII 5:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“With hundred-knotted thunderbolt, sharpened and edged with razor-blades,<br>
Strike off the shoulders and the head.<br>
Snatch Thou the hair from off his head, and from his body strip the skin:<br>
Tear out his sinews, cause his flesh to fall in pieces from his frame.<br>
Crush Thou his bones together, strike and beat the marrow out of him.<br>
Dislocate all his limbs and joints.<br>
From Earth let the Carnivorous Agni drive him, let Vayu burn him from Mid-Air’s broad Region.<br>
From Heaven let Sūrya drive him and consume him.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The Goddess-Figure invoked in those verses is referred to as ‘The Brahman’s Cow’ – I have taken this to mean ‘Vak’, for reasons I have enunciated at far greater length and breadth elsewhere.</p>
<h2 id="angirasi">Angirasi</h2>
<p>She is invoked pointedly as an Angirasi – a Daughter of Angiras … and it ought prove not difficult to see how that fits into our earlier-aforementioned scale of rubric; given the role of the Angiras-priest as set out above.</p>
<p>The reason <em>why</em> She is thusly invoked in such forcefully Avenging tones therein,<br>
is because such force (‘Shakti’, indeed) is to be unleashed, roaring,
upon some calumnious covetous converter who has <em>dared</em> to try and make off with what we might, perhaps, in light (yajna-given) of various afore-referenced Brahmanas etc.<br>
refer to as “The Brahman’s Wife”<br>
and otherwise disrupt the Rite and proper religious proceeding attendant accordingly.</p>
<p>The points of resonancy with our lately-prominent figure of Pratyangira ought prove readily apparent.</p>
<p>There is more – much more – with relation to Pratyangira which could be written or said.</p>
<p>But for now, I think that it is (likely more than) enough.</p>
<p>May our foeman’s curses break and seizings lose their grip,<br>
the forces he feels at his command recoil upon him with aptly judicious and hilarious results;<br>
And that which he has stolen from us return swiftly forthwith!</p>
<p>Through the Shakti Which Knows No End: that Thunderous Lioness’ Roar (In Answer)</p>
