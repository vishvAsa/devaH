With the rise of the new god vinAyaka, the old vedic deity brAhmaNaspati==bR^ihaspati was identified with him. The expansion of this identity was a medieval phenomenon that developed in the region encompassing the modern Mh-TN states. Several bR^ihaspati mantra-s were now systematically recast and reinterpreted as vinAyaka-mantra-s within this burgeoning gANapatya tradition. This additionally had a symbiotic entwining with the growing shrIkula influence on certain sections of smArta-s and beyond.
