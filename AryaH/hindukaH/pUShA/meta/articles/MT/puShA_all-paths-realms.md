title = "puShA - all-paths-realms"

In the ashvamedha ritual a goat is led before the sacrificial horse. The goat is for puShan & the horse is for indra.
In offering of the goat to puShan in the ashvamedha a similar reference is made to the all-ness of puShan.

facing to the good east, bleating repeatedly, the goat, is "all forms" -> vishvarUpa. Thus, Socrates was channeling an ancient IE memory

 The triple-fold yajurvedic incantation to puShan as in the shruti of the kaTha-s as the protector on the road; of the herds of cattle and as the overlord:

> pUShA mA prapathe pAtu |  
> pUShA mA pashupAH pAtu |  
> pUShA mAdhipatiH pAtu ||

The maitrAyaNIya-s have:

> pUShA mA pathipAH pAtu |  
> pUShA mA pashupAH pAtu |  
> pUShA mAdhipAH pAtu ||

This is explained by the kaTha-s in their brAhmaNa statement:

> iyaM vai pUShA prapathe,  
> .antarikShaM pashupA,  
> dyaur adhipatir,  
> ima evainaM lokAH pAnti ||

> In this realm puShan on the roads;  
> in the atmosphere the herd-protector;  
> the heavens the lord.  
> Thus, these verily protect these worlds.


The brAhmaNa on the incantation of the maitrAyaNIya-s has:

> pUShA mA pathipAH pAtv iti |  
> iyam eva |  
> 
> pUShA mA pashupAH pAtv iti |  
> antarikShameva | 
> pUShA mAdhipAH pAtv iti |  
> asau eva |  
> imAn eva lokAn upAsarat |  
> ebhyo lokebhya AtmAnaM paridhatte |  
> ahiMsAyai ||

the statement is similar to that of the kaTha, critically adding that he verily covers these (all 3) realms with the incantation. Finally the taittirIya-shruti has the following incantation:

> pUShAdhvanaH pAtu ||

It can be mundanely rendered as: "May puShan protect the paths"; but it can also be validly rendered as: "May puShan protect the realms". +++(5)+++

The taittirIyaka-s specify a brAhmaNa relating to this which is uttered when a cow is exchanged for soma: 

> pUShAdhvanaH pAtv ity Aha |  
> iyaM vai pUShA |  
> imAm evAsyA adhipAm akar |  
> samaShTyai |

He utters this incantation; puShan is this world; he thus equates the cow with the lady ruling this [world] for its aquisition. Thus, the incantation associates puShan with the covering/ protection through the 3 realms. He is the watcher or protector covering the three realms. 

The adhvan could also symbolize the celestial zodiacal path.
