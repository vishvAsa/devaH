## grahāḥ
- Tilak: "The word graha which in the sacrificial literature denotes vessel has been used in later astronomical works to denote the planets, the number of which, including the sun and the moon, is fixed at nine, the same as the number of the vessels used for sacrificial purposes."

### वेनः
- वेनः सुक्रो सूर्यबुध्न्यो यज्ञप्रेरकः। सम्पद्दाता (तै.सं ७.२)। तन्नाम्नैव श्रौतयागे सोमग्रहो वर्तते।
- Tilak: "In the tenth Mandala we have a hymn (123) dedicated to Vena which according to Yaska denotes a deity of the middle region. Yaska (Nirukta 10. 38) derives the word from ven 'to love,' to desire,' and explains it as denoting, as his commentator Durgacharya says, “loved by all;"\* while the hymn itself contains such expressions as the "son of the sun," "on the top of r̥ta," "comes out of the ocean like a wave," † &c., which have been variously interpreted by the commentators. But from all these facts I think we have herein the original Aryan name of Venus. ... I may again point out that the hymn of Vena in the Rigveda, is used in sacrifices at the time, when the priest takes up the vessel Shukra in the sacrificial ceremonies."
    - "In the Latin mythology Venus is the goddess of love... Aphrodite who, in Greek mythology, is said to be sprung from the foam of the sea."
- The hymn of Vena in the Rigveda, is used in sacrifices at the time, when the priest takes up the vessel Shukra in the sacrificial ceremonies.\* +++(• See Durgacharya on Nirukta 10.39, शुक्रो ग्रहो ऽनया गृह्यते.)+++
    - Cognate of Greek word Kupris (Latin Cypris). Wrong derivation: Kupris from Kupros the Greek name of the island of Cyprus, which had lots of cypress trees; but then no derivation for tree name.
