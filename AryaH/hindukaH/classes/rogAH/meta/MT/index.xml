      <description>&lt;p&gt;Evidently the association has many strands and how all of them came together remains unclear. There is the tale of reNukA&amp;rsquo;s adultery (covered here:  &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2006/03/06/the-death-of-renuka/&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;). 1 persistent narrative is that she obtained the cures of for various poxes and herpes after being banished by j for the adultery from the ashvin-s. She then returned to j with her blemishes cleared with these cures. Now yellamma appears to have been a folk goddess of the poxes. That seems to have been fused with reNukA and mixed with the adultery and beheading tales.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
