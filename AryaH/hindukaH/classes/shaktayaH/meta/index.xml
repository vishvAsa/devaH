      <description>&lt;p&gt;हिङ्गलजमातू रूपम् इति प्रतीतिः।&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;इतहस&#34;&gt;इतिहासः&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;१९६५&#34;&gt;१९६५&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Despite heavy bombardment (approximately 3,000 shells are supposed to have been fired, with several hundred directly hitting the Temple and Mandir’s grounds itself), multi-directional assault from three sides, and a significant numerical disadvantage, the Indians held fast and repulsed the invaders. For as it turned out, not a single shell fired nor bomb dropped at the Temple had exploded. Literally hundreds of munitions had all somehow either failed to detonate, or had mysteriously flown off-course; with some Pakistani air force personnel reportedly claiming that during their attack-runs, instead of being able to see the Temple … they could only see a small girl sitting beside a lake. … Following the conclusion of the 1965 War with Pakistan, the Indian Border Security Force took over the Temple – they now run it, administer it, and have established a small dedicated base on the grounds.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
