## इतिहासः
### १९६५
> Despite heavy bombardment (approximately 3,000 shells are supposed to have been fired, with several hundred directly hitting the Temple and Mandir’s grounds itself), multi-directional assault from three sides, and a significant numerical disadvantage, the Indians held fast and repulsed the invaders. For as it turned out, not a single shell fired nor bomb dropped at the Temple had exploded. Literally hundreds of munitions had all somehow either failed to detonate, or had mysteriously flown off-course; with some Pakistani air force personnel reportedly claiming that during their attack-runs, instead of being able to see the Temple … they could only see a small girl sitting beside a lake. … Following the conclusion of the 1965 War with Pakistan, the Indian Border Security Force took over the Temple – they now run it, administer it, and have established a small dedicated base on the grounds.

### १९७१
> The main Indian anti-tank weapon at Longewala was a jeep-mounted recoilless rifle. It had been supposed to be withdrawn and re-assigned the day before the engagement; yet due to mysterious happenstance had been significantly delayed and unable to leave afore the reports came in of the impending Pakistani armoured thrust. It was to prove vital in the ensuing defence. As were the Indian artillery-pieces nearby that had only just managed to be deployed scant hours before the commencement of the assault.

> ... Tanot was attacked again in 1971. Pakistani tanks began a barrage on the village but by Tanot Mata's grace enemy tanks got stuck in the sand for several hours, giving time to the Indian Air Force to pick them off one by one.
