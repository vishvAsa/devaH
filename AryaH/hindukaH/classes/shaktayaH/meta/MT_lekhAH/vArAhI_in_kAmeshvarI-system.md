The tirumantiram represents a syncretic tradition combining the siddhAnta & the traipura systems. The drAviDa-stotra to vArAhI you cited from it is indeed clear on this matter. It inheres specifically from the kameshvarI lineage of the traipura system that was particularly strong in the drAviDa country as presented in the lalitopAkhyAna. In that vArAhI & her 1000 pArShadI-s are incorporated independently of the other mAtR^i-s as daNDanAthA or the commander of the armies of kAmeshvarI. 

tripurA herself is praised by an epithet invokingthe acts of vArAhI as: 

> vishukra-prANaharaNa-vArAhI-vIrya-nanditA | 

We also have evidence from the adoption by the nAstika-s of the widespread existence of an independent cult of vArAhI; some H temples to the deity throughout the country support that contention.
