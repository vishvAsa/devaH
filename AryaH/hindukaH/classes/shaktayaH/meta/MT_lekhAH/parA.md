The trika-kula's parA devI seated on her supine consort bhairava-sadbhAva. The deity was to eventually have a deep influence on 2 of the other kula lineages, the dakShiNAMnAya (shrIkula) & pashchimAMnAya (kubjikA), the saiddhAntika-s (as the sarasvatI of the system), pA~ncharAtra vaiShNava (in ahirbudhnya saMhitA) and sAmAnya-smArta where her 5-headed form became the iconography &deity of the sAvitrI displacing the original deity of the veda savitR^i. Posting an alternative tricephalic version of her as ekavIrA encompassing the bhairavI's aparA & parAparA
