Vedic sense of a~nji has some mystery to it. It has a clear connection to the marut-s. 

For e.g. we have in the RV: ye pR^iShatIbhir R^iShTibhiH sAkaM vAshIbhir a~njibhiH | ajAyanta svabhAnavaH || It is normally translated as unguent. In fact has an IE pedigree with that word. However, it is mentioned here with the weapons of the marut-s R^iShTi (spear) and vAshI (battle pickaxe).

Here again it is mentioned with the battle axe, armor and gauntlets: ye a~njiShu ye vAshIShu svabhAnavaH srakShu rukmeShu khAdiShu | ... The a~nji of the marut-s is also notably said to be brilliant white in color. Some times the word a~nji is also taken to mean brilliant. So it could mean the lighting weapon of the marut-s.
