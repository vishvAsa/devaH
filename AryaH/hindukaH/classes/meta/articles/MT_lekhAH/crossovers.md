I think this has to be seen in light of a theological interpretation of IE polytheism that I wish to lay out at some point if the gods are favorable --the overlap of domains. 

I wished to say in response to your earlier twt-disquisition where you presented the parallels between the divine twins in the Hellene world -- the rudrian dyad emerging from Leto & the Dioscuri from Leda whose names might in turn be related. I was just not upto a long theological discursion. In the H world, in the RV the ashvin-s -- the Dioscurian cognates are primarily rudrian. In the later tradition they become Adityan via the sharaNyu myth as you noted. Thus, the ashvin-s as sons of vivasvAn might be seen as a crossover from their original rudrian realm into the Adityan realm.

In the kaTha brAhmaNa section above you see rudra crossing over into the Adityan realm. In the later Hellene tradition you see Apollo crossing over into the Adityan realm. 

varuNa from Adityan realm, sometimes crosses into rudrian realm.
