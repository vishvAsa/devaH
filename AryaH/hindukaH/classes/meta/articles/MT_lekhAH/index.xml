      <description>&lt;p&gt;I think this has to be seen in light of a theological interpretation of IE polytheism that I wish to lay out at some point if the gods are favorable &amp;ndash;the overlap of domains.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I wished to say in response to your earlier twt-disquisition where you presented the parallels between the divine twins in the Hellene world &amp;ndash; the rudrian dyad emerging from Leto &amp;amp; the Dioscuri from Leda whose names might in turn be related. I was just not upto a long theological discursion. In the H world, in the RV the ashvin-s &amp;ndash; the Dioscurian cognates are primarily rudrian. In the later tradition they become Adityan via the sharaNyu myth as you noted. Thus, the ashvin-s as sons of vivasvAn might be seen as a crossover from their original rudrian realm into the Adityan realm.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
