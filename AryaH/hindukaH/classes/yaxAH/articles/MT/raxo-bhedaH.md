The taittirIya shruti hints that the rakShas are a brother race of the yakSha-s. The rAmAyaNa confirms that. 

The yakSha-s are generally beneficent especially when properly invoked.  
The king of the yakSha-s receives shrauta rituals like the gods. 

The rakSha-s are malignant in contrast and generally cause obstructions to shrauta rituals.  
The  rAmAyaNa has a second type of rakShas: a yakSha or a gandharva who due to a curse have become a rakShas.
