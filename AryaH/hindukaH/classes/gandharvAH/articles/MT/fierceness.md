A Japanese drawing of chaNDa gandharva.  
This fierce gandharva, who spikes heads of humans & other animals on his trident, retains some of the dark aspect of this class of beings in the Indo-Iranian tradition. 

This is seen in the veda, where the ambivalent gandharva can possess v1 women but speak profound thoughts via them -- like shamanic possession.  
In the Mbh aggressive gandharva-s like chitrA~ngada killed the eponymous kuru king, while also fighting the pANDu-s.  
In both the shruti and the Mbh a gandharva sent via abhichAra kills the errant v1 yavakrIDa.  
In the rAmAyaNa they assume forms of rakShas and spear heads of victims like the Japanese exemplar (virAdha).
