      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://x.com/blog_supplement/status/1835917072280273357&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The gods bhaga and savitR^i have overlapping functions. However, the action of their functions is in different domains.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;As an analogy, one may point to the tripartition of indra, parjanya and dyaus.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;The true apprehender of the shruti, after careful meditation on these gods, starts to see why, despite their overlapping functions, they are distinct in their domains.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then there is some overlap of function with tvaShTR^i (and his ectype dhAtR^i).&lt;br&gt;&#xA;That relates to the Hindu equivalent of the Platonic realm.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;(Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://threader.app/thread/1447434449222881285&#34;&gt;https://threader.app/thread/1447434449222881285&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Who is the deity dhAtR? The later itihAsa-purANa place him in the Aditya class. In the RV it may be an epithet for multiple deities, but explicitly it mentioned as an epithet for visvakarman, who in turn is an epithet of the ancient tvaShTR. tvaShTR accompanies the the wives of the gods &amp;amp; other goddesses at the ritual. He appears in a similar role accompanying the sarasvatI and sinIvAlI in the sArasvata rite. There sarasvatI is also paired with the divine eagle deity (elsewhere tArkShyo ariShTanemiH or garutmant) manifesting in an androgynous aspect as sarasvant.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The non-Zoroastrian Iranic goddess Tabiti likely cognate of Indian tapatI.+++(5)+++ She is the solar goddess daughter of the sun. It is possible that the shaka rulers traced descent from her, such as the shaka ruler shown with the drinking horn in front of her. This legend was likely transmitted to Japan as she was syncretized with Amaterasu &amp;amp; the same legend adopted as the found myth of the Japanese emperors.+++(5)+++&lt;/p&gt;</description>
