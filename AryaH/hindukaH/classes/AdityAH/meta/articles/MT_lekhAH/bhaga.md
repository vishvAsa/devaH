The gods bhaga and savitR^i have overlapping functions. However, the action of their functions is in different domains.  
As an analogy, one may point to the tripartition of indra, parjanya and dyaus.  
The true apprehender of the shruti, after careful meditation on these gods, starts to see why, despite their overlapping functions, they are distinct in their domains. 

Then there is some overlap of function with tvaShTR^i (and his ectype dhAtR^i).  
That relates to the Hindu equivalent of the Platonic realm.  

After having realized their connections and distinctness, one sees the completeness of the religion of the shruti.  

A strand of the Iranian religion had the part related to bhaga in an expanded form but not the totality.  
However, the actual rahasya-s that are realized are not to be presented in public, for they only to be apprehended by the practitioner and expounded to compatible students.
