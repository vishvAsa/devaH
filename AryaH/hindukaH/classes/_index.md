## असुरः
- हिन्दुकेरानकविभागात् पूर्वम् परस्परम् बह्व् अमन्यन्त देवान् असुरांश् च। असुरा इति पूज्यन्ते केचन देवास् स्पष्टम् - यथा वरुणः, रुद्रः।
- Etruscan: Aisar. Norse - Aesir. Sire इति। Zoroastrian Ahura. 

## Foreign Gods
Vedas enumerate several *classes* of Gods - vasus, rudras, Adityas, Rbhus, sAdhyas, apsarases ... without enumerating their members exhaustively. That may naturally encompass foreign Gods. If the sages had regard for the *category* of Gods, thought that Gods are natural, and that there are wise members of other tribes (which is rational), they would not consider foreign Gods as worthy of contempt.

As testament to this, some Gods entered our pantheon from outside the IA core, ranging from Altaic Uma to chAmuNDa and gaNapati.
