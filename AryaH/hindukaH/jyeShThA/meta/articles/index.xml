      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: The Delightful Story of the Cussword, “Moo Devi” by SandIp on dharma dispatch site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Puranic roots and cultural metamorphosis of the expletive, &amp;ldquo;Moo Devi&amp;rdquo; prevalent in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Until recently, and even today in the rural crevices of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, the slur Moo-Devi (or Moodevi)was a fact of nature. Like breathing. In the delightful world of such rustic slurs, Moodevi is a unique absorbent in the sense that you can pretty much assign it any derogatory connotation and it will be understood as such by both the giver and the recipient. As its suffix implies, it is the exclusive property of the female, and can mean anything from “dumb-wit,” “stupid,” “fool,” “incompetent,” “loose-tongued,” “contemptuous,” and “immoral.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>
