Swami Shanmuga from Tiruchendur. Why is the Vigraha like this ? There is a history behind it. During the time of Thirumalai Nayakar (1649) who was ruling Madurai, the European powers of Dutch & Portuguese were fighting for a foothold here. Portuguese had a base in Tuticorin, Dutch landed in nearby Tiruchendur & a battle took place between them. After it was won by Dutch, they occupied Tiruchendur temple & made it as their base. Now this has completely put the temple in disarray.

The devotees complained to Thirumalai Nayak who had asked the Dutch forces to leave, but they refused. Nayakar sent a small army to remove them from the temple. In that conflict, few Dutch soldiers lost their lives. With no compensation provided by Nayakar for their losses, the Dutch looted the temple and ran with the Shanmuga & Nataraja vigrahas thinking that they were made up of Gold.

While on the way to Srikanka, they had to face rough weather. Thinking that it was due to the gods they had carried, Dutch threw the Vigrahas in the sea & escaped.

After sometime, Lord Muruga appeared in the dream of Vadamalayappa Pillai, the representative of Thirumalai Nayak and told him that HE is in the deep sea. The place will be marked by a lemon floating on the top of the sea & a Garuda going around the place.

Immediately Vadamalayappa Pillai set out to the sea with a team of divers. He saw the place as specified with a lemon floating & Garuda circling. The divers went in & retrieved the Vigrahas

Due to the salt water impact & fish bites, the Vigraha of the Swami got changed. Vadamalayappa Pillai brought them back to Tiruchendur & did the Prathishta in the temple. The entire incident is recorded in an inscription in the temple with even the names of the divers mentioned

Such is the grace of Subramanya !

During this monthâ€™s festival, Shanmuga comes out in Brahma (white), Vishnu (green)& Siva (red) swaroppams.
