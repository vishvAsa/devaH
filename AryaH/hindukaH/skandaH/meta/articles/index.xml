      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1760243390879498662.html&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Swami Shanmuga from Tiruchendur. Why is the Vigraha like this ? There is a history behind it. During the time of Thirumalai Nayakar (1649) who was ruling Madurai, the European powers of Dutch &amp;amp; Portuguese were fighting for a foothold here. Portuguese had a base in Tuticorin, Dutch landed in nearby Tiruchendur &amp;amp; a battle took place between them. After it was won by Dutch, they occupied Tiruchendur temple &amp;amp; made it as their base. Now this has completely put the temple in disarray.&#xA;Image&#xA;The devotees complained to Thirumalai Nayak who had asked the Dutch forces to leave, but they refused. Nayakar sent a small army to remove them from the temple. In that conflict, few Dutch soldiers lost their lives. With no compensation provided by Nayakar for their losses, the Dutch looted the temple and ran with the Shanmuga &amp;amp; Nataraja vigrahas thinking that they were made up of Gold.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
