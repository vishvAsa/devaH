When he successfully performs the mantra-s taught by skanda himself, meditating on the lotus of his forehead, he sees the ferocious therocephalous yoginI-s like siMhamukhI, mArjArI, R^ikShAkShI, vArAhI, vR^iShAnanA, ajAnanA, R^ikShakarNI and the like, as ordained in the yAmala tantra. He then pleases them with the rahastarpaNa and the rahoyAga. If his rite is successful, he has taken a step on the highest mantramarga\*. He who attempts the secret mantra-s without the sign and permission of skanda attains dismal failure.

\* we are generally aligned with some practitioners that this is one of several highest tAntrika practices of ultimately equal potency.
