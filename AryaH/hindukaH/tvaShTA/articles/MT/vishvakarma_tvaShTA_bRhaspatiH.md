By the late vedic period, as indicated by the uttaranArAyaNa, vishvakarman was seen as a name of tvaShTR^i. This name superseded tvaShTR^i in the itihAsa-purANa where we encounter vishvakarman more commonly as the maker of the vajra. 

## bRhaspati or tvaShTR
However, from RV 10.81 and AV we get a hint that vishvakarman was originally applied to a similarly demiurgic manifestation of bR^ihaspati, especially in his manifestation as vAchas pati. 

In early vedic tradition it appears that there were parallel traditions of demiurgic function featuring either bR^ihaspati and tvaShTR^i. 

## prajApati
In the later vedic tradition prajApati overran both their demiurgic roles. The paurANika brahman was an ectype of prajApati but inherited iconographic elements of bR^ihaspati-viShvakarman. 

## tvaShTR smithy
In the itihAsa-purANa vishvakarman-tvaShTR^i was left with just his smithing (= engineering) roles.
