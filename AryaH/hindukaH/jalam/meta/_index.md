- आपः - सर्वा देवताः। पावक्यः।

>  yā divyā āpaḥ payasā saṃbabhūvuḥ | yā antarikṣa uta pārthivīryāḥ | - "The earthly realm is easily understood: the oceans and rivers and the like. The atmospheric realm too is obvious. the heavenly realm - Milky way. Even the moon is said to be contained in them. "
> The idea of divyā āpaḥ is also philosophically satisfying in a current sense. After all where did water on the earth come from? Most likely from the asteroids, the comets, and the objects of the dwarf planet belt. Thus, we may say all the earthly waters are indeed from the divyā āpaḥ.
