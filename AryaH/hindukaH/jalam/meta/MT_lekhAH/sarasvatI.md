## अप्सम्बन्धः, प्राचीनता च
> The river is textually identified with
  the aquatic deity of the Indo-Aryans, sarasvatI who is widely worshiped
  in the R^igveda and persists to this date in the modern Hindu religions
  as a consort of brahmA. ...

> One of the important themes that emerges from the aponaptrIya ritual is
  the intimate connection between sarasvati and Agni as worshipped as the
  son of the waters or apAM napAta. This fiery entity hidden with the
  water is of ancient IE provenance as is evidenced by the word naptha
  meaning a fiery substance and the same time bearing a relationship to
  the word naptar or relative, suggesting that it was essentially derived
  from the ancestral state ApAM napAt. The connection between the water
  deity and apAM napAt (who is described as being surrounded) by water
  nymphs (another ancient IE concept) can be demonstrated in a number of
  IE myths.

> The point to note here is that ardvi
  sura anAhitA is a perfect cognate of sarasvati and not a physical river
  as has been often claimed for the sarasvatI. She is generically as well
  as specifically associated with several rivers: Vitanghuhaiti on whose
  bank the Naotaras worshipped her, river Rangha homologous to R^igvedic
  Rasa (also mentioned in the Jaiminiya brAhmaNa) or the great river
  flowing down from Hukriya down to the Vouru kasha. Thus Anahita and
  sarasvatI are archetypal water goddesses, who were worshiped with much
  intensity by the IEans and who may get associated with physical rivers
  as well as apAM napat.
