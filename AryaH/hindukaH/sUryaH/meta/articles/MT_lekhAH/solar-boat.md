In the atharvan ritual, the Aditya-maNDaka cake is offered to indra and viShNu, who are invoked in the rising sun with the viShAsahi incantations. In the conclusion of that rite, the day boat and the night boat of the sun are invoked with a dyad of mantra-s:

> Aditya nAvam ArukShaH  
shatAritrAM svastaye |  
ahar mAty apIparo  
rAtriM satrAti pAraya ||

> O Aditya, you have mounted your boat with a hundred oars for our well-being.  
You have transported me to day: so also bear me to night.

> sUrya nAvam ArukShaH shatAritrAM svastye |
rAtriM mAty apIparo .ahaH satrAti pAraya ||

> O sUrya, you have mounted your boat with a hundred oars for our well-being.
You have transported me to night: so also bear me to night.

As an aside ritualist with ancestry from the andhra country deployed the atharvanic incantations with a mistake precisely in these mantra-s. As a result he has been having some negative effects. He's hoping to redo the rite to fix things but has become nervous of making errors.

Similarly, the Egyptians have the concept of the day and the night boat of their solar deity, Re, which is highly significant for them. Below are two depictions of the day and the night boat in the Books of the Dead of two Egyptians, Qenena and Iufankh from very different period.  Below is an incantation to Re mentioning the two boats comparable to the atharvan one:

> Jubilation for you, maker of the gods,  
raising the sky to the embrace of his eyes,  
maker of the earth to the breadth of his Light,  
to allow each man to sight his second,  
the night boat is in rejoicing,  
the day boat is in jubliation,  
they have crossed the primeval waters for you,  
in peace, with your crew peaceful.  
the cobra-goddess of light has overthrown your enemies,  
you have seized the step of Aapep,  
perfect as Ra every day
