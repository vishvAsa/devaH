Almost 20 years ago on a defunct internet forum I'd written about the H cognate of Brigid. I agree with you that bhR^ihatI per se is not a theonym specific to the uShas-es. It is also applied to a distinct goddess sarasvatI. However, the cognate of Brigid does exist in our midst as the great goddess, mother bR^ihaddivA also known as the celestial urvashI -- we make an oblation to her in the patnIsaMyAja of the new/full-moons. It is possible an element of her theonym is laterally applied to both the uShas-es & sarasvatI in their celestial aspect. Her connection to the national goddess aspect is illustrated by the manifestation as urvaShI the mother of the bhArata dynasty. I've been intending to revisit this issue and write if the gods are favorable.
