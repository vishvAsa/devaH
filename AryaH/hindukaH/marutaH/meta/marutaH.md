## अन्यजनेषु
### इरानिकेषु
> This might also explain
  the “loss of the maruts” in the Iranian line – with the whole-scale
  demonization of the raudra class, their leader saurva-daeva was retained
  as a demon, but the symbolism of the multiplicity of the marut-s was now
  without value to the Iranian. However, the mention of the seven powers
  of aeshma-daeva in the bundahishn is probably not a coincidence and a
  reminiscence derived from the seven-fold marudgaNa-s \[Footnote 3\].
  Thus, only the essence of the marut-s was abstracted in the form of
  their unique epithet aeshma and retained as yet another daeva. This
  parallels the positive “essentialization” with contraction of the
  marut-s to give rise to the deity skanda.

### Berserks
> Now the presence of marut-like deities in the raudra class is a fairly
  ancient trait of the Indo-European system. Some have recognized that the
  original berserks \[not the human warriors who emulated them\] who
  accompanied Odinn, the cognate of rudra among the Germanic peoples, were
  a potentially cognates of the maruts. Even as Germanic paganism was
  being extinguished by the evil of the pretamata, Snorri Sturluson
  recorded in the Ynglinga saga that the berserks, strong as bears or wild
  bulls, slaughtered men, but neither fire nor steel harmed them
  \[Footnote 4\]. This simultaneous comparison to bears and wild bulls
  (hence Germanic bär= bear; serk=shirt) is interesting because it is also
  used specifically for the marut-s in RV \[Footnote 5\].

>Footnote 5: In a mantra of the atri-s deployed in the great offerings to
 the marut-s in the soma ritual they are thus invoked:

> Strong as a bear, O marut-s, is your violent charge, terrible as a wild
 gaur.

## रोमकेषु
> Further, marut-like deities were apparently also present in the Roman
world as suggested by deities, the Lares and Semones, in the ritual
incantation, the [Carmen
