Now, Vrishchika tell me what you think of this narrative?”

> V: “I believe it had its roots in the ancient Indo-Iranian system of the supreme Vāyu, with a Prājāpatya overlay atop that. Indeed Kubera and Vāyu simultaneously figure as mighty deities in the backdrop of the Rāmāyaṇa and to some extent also in the Mahābhārata. Hence, their connection does not seem unexpected.
>
> Moreover, along with the other deity of the same class, Rudra, the three of them adorn the northern face of the dik-maṇḍala — NE-N-NW. The primordial body referred to in this narrative is verily the puruṣa of the śruti. There indeed it has been said ‘prāṇād vāyur ajāyata \|‘ and Vāyu was seen as the breath within the puruṣa. In this myth we see an allusion the the role of Vāyu in the creative process. It is amply clear from the śruti that in the old system focused on Vāyu he was conceived as playing a central role in this process. Indeed, in the mantra to Vāyu-Vāta we hear:
>
>> ‘ātmā devānām bhuvanasya garbho  
yathā-vaśaṃ carati deva eṣaḥ \|  
ghoṣā id asya śṛṇvire na rūpaṃ  
tasmai vātāya haviṣā vidhema \|\|’  
>> The breath of the gods, the germ of the universe,  
this god wanders as he wishes.  
Only his sounds are heard, not \[seen is\] his form.  
For him, for Vāta, we would do honor with our oblation.
>
> We see here that the deity is presented as the germ of the universe (reflective of the creative process) and his formlessness which is alluded to in the myth you narrated is also a central element of this mantra. Tellingly, the very first mantra of the sūkta captures aspects of his storminess mentioned in this myth as he emerged from the face of Brahmā with a shower of grit.:  
>> ‘vātasya nu mahimānaṃ rathasya  
rujann eti stanayann asya ghoṣaḥ \|  
divispṛg yāty aruṇāni kṛṇvann  
uto eti pṛthivyā reṇum asyan \|\|’  
>> Now for the greatness of Vāta and his chariot:  
smashing he proceeds; thundering is his noise.  
Touching heaven as he drives, making things red,  
also blowing up dust from the earth he goes.
>
> Thus, I would conclude that at the foundation of the Varāha-purāṇa narrative are clear motifs coming from the old Vāyu-centric system such as those expressed in the sūkta I just mentioned.”

> I.s: “That is good, Vrishichika. It touches on something which will come up again as I expound the ritual itself. One may also note the this idea of the Vāyu within the primordial body might have been behind another somewhat mysterious name of the god — Mātariśvan — he who grows within the mother or womb. Thus, it is likely that what was meant in this name was Vāyu filling up the interior of the ‘primordial womb’. His emergence from the mouth of the protogonic deity is something that evidently had a deep history: 
> 
> While in the Puruṣa-sūkta it is Indra and Agni who emerge from the Puruṣa’s mouth, we have a bauddha text the Avalokiteśvara-guṇa-karaṇḍavyūha where the nāstika-s have appropriated the mythologem of the puruṣa for their invention, the Avalokiteśvara. In that text we hear of the various gods emerging from the different organs of the macranthropic Avalokiteśvara and Vāyu is specifically mentioned as emerging from his mouth. This suggests the existence of an old āstika source with such an imagery from which this concept was borrowed by the bauddhas.
>
> Now further, while in the Varāha-purāṇa myth the motifs acquired from the Vāyu-focused system may have been placed in a Prājāpatya context typical of the earlier paurāṇika narratives, we must not miss the fact that right from the beginning Vāyu had an intimate connection with the protogonic deity with roots likely going back to the para-Vedic systems of the Indo-Iranian period with evolutes lasting until much latter on both the Indian and Iranian sides. This is already apparent in the prājāpatya portions of the late śruti. In the Śatapatha-brāhmaṇa we hear: ‘sa eṣa vāyuḥ prajapatiḥ \|‘ (This Vāyu is Prajāpati). It is further expounded in the Kauśītaki-brāhmaṇa that the manifest form of Prajāpati is Vāyu: ‘prajāpateḥ pratyaksaṃ rupaṃ yad vāyur iti\|‘. The Śatapatha-brāhmaṇa goes on to even present Prajāpati as a composite of himself and Vāyu: ‘ardhaṃ ha prajāpater vayuḥ \| ardham prajapatiḥ \| Regarding this intimate connection between the two deities, I could point to a rather late survival of this idea in the Garuḍa-purāṇa (mokṣa-kāṇḍa) in a rather pristine form albeit lodged within a larger, quite unwholesome Vaiṣṇava section, which tries to establish the superiority of Viṣṇu over the other gods:
>   
>> अन्नाभिमानं ब्रह्म चाहुर् मुरारिं  
जीवाभिमानं वायुम् आहुर् महान्तः ।  
न शक्तो ऽसौ ब्रह्म-देवो विवस्तुं  
वायुं विना संसृताव् एव नित्यम् ॥  
न तं विना मातरिश्वा च वस्तुम्  
अन्योन्यम् आप्तिः कालतो न्यूनता च ।  
यदा महत्-तत्त्वनि यामको भूद्  
ब्रह्माण्डान्त-स्थूल-सृष्टौ महात्मा ॥  
तदा वायुर् नाशकद्वै महात्मा  
बाह्ये सृष्टौ कालभेदेन चास्ति ।  
>
>> The great sages have declared that Brahmā and Murāri (Viṣṇu) are the nutritive principle, \[whereas\] Vāyu is the metabolic principle. Verily, this god Brahma does not have ever the ability to emit the universe without Vāyu. Without him (Brahmā) Mātariśvan (Vāyu) does not have place to dwell. (O great soul), their relative strengths and wants depends on the course of time. When \[Brahmā\] restrained of the principles \[evolving from\] mahat in the \[primordial\] world-egg from manifesting as material creation Vāyu could not set it motion. The evolution of the manifest universe \[by Vāyu\] happens only with passage of time.
>
> Thus, Alini, in this system Vāyu and Brahmā are close and almost equal partners in the manifestation of the material universe. Indeed, it appears that these ideas were preserved by a group of late-surviving Vāyu-focused thinkers who later converted to the Vaiṣṇava-mata in southern India. This becomes apparent from a discussion occurring earlier in this section of the Garuḍa-purāṇa wherein the votaries are asked to set up an image of Vāyu and worship it. However, it is then clarified that Vāyu is merely a symbol of Viṣṇu and that Vāyu should only be offered the ucchiṣṭa of Viṣṇu. Notably, it warns votaries who offer fresh flowers, sandalwood and incense to Vāyu and says that they would eternally suffer unless they meditate on Viṣṇu as an expiation. The last statement clinches their Vāyu-focality prior to their conversion. 
> 
> Their unconverted versions still exist, albeit in a degenerate form, in the Lāṭa country — a point we will revisit in the context of the paramparā of our ritual.”

> V: “Ah! Having sat in on a discussion Lootika and Somakhya once had, I do see the parallels to the comparable Iranic systems. 
> 
> In the Zoroastrian stream of the Iranic tradition, despite all the demonization of the ancestral deva-s, Vāyu still retains his primacy. In the yasht of Rama Hvastra even Ahura Mazdāh worships Vāyu to aid him in creation by countering Angra Mainyu. 
> 
> In the para-Zoroastrian system of Zurvān (Avestan: Zrva, cognate of Sanskrit sarva) he comes as an integral partner of the great time deity Zurvān who has a fundamentally protogonic character. Thus, Zurvān, associated with time and Vāyu associated with space are the heart of the genesis of this Iranic system. The integral association of Zurvān and Vāyu is already seen in the Zoroastrian Avesta where they are invoked together and are supplied with the epithet ‘deregho khvadhāta (dīrgha-svadhātṛ in our tongue)’. i.e. those who have long-standing law of their own. 
> 
> That Zurvān was an old deity with his own system is seen from the occurrence of his name close to the Avestan form in the Nuzi documents from Iraq dating to around 3200-3400 years ago where we find some of the earliest attestations of the Iranians in archaeology. This association is also recorded by Eudemus of Rhodes, the student of Aristotle, who notes that the Iranians regard Time (Zurvān) and Space (Vāyu) as the foundational principles of the universe. That he was referring to the para-Zoroastrian Zurvān worshipers becomes apparent from a comparable system presented in Zurvānistic Iranic traditions preserved by the Zoroastrians in their Denkart, where Zurvan as time is the generative principle and Vāyu provides the space for the entities that come into being due to Zurvan. There, Vāyu is also the one who conveys the good things bestowed by Zurvān to men — this perhaps captures a bit of his nature as the messenger, which we see in his Mātariśvan form in our tradition. Thus, his association with the Iranic protogonic deities, be he Ahura Mazdāh or Zrva, in the generative process is indeed a parallel to his association with Brahmā in our tradition.”

> I.s: “As we move from Vāyu, who was specifically hymned by your ancestor Vāmadeva, to Kubera, we again find these parallels between Indo-Aryan and Iranian tradition as illuminating their association. Clearly in our tradition Vāyu-Vāta has both a benign and malignant nature. In the mantra you mentioned he is described as \`’rujan’ i.e. smashing. This nature is clearly brought out in his earthly epic manifestations, the ape Hanūmat and the Pāṇḍava Bhīma. On the other hand, as you correctly mentioned, in the Iranic tradition Vāyu conveys the good things of Zurvan to men. This is his benign aspect which comes up in the second such Vāta-sūkta in the RV:  
>
>> vāta ā vātu bheṣajaṃ śambhu mayobhu no hṛde \|  
pra ṇa āyūṃṣi tāriṣat \|\|  
uta vāta pitāsi na uta bhrātota naḥ sakhā \|  
sa no jīvātave kṛdhi \|\|  
yad ado vāta te gṛhe ‘mṛtasya nidhir hitaḥ \|  
tato no dehi jīvase \|\|
>   
>> May Vāta blow towards us a medicine, which is auspicious and conferring weal to our heart. May he lengthen our lives.  
O Vāta, you are father to us, and brother, and also a friend to us. Make us live long.  
O Vāta, what wealth of ambrosia has been placed yonder in your house, give us of that for us to live.  
>
> Here, we see that the benign aspect of Vāyu is emphasized with him being a bearer of medicines (note a similar role played by Hanūmat in the Rāmāyaṇa), fellowship and the ambrosia. Importantly, note the amṛtasya nidhiḥ, which becomes important for the connection with the Mahārāja. On the Iranian side Vāyu again is invoked for benign gifts such as protection from yātudhāna-s, a long life, offspring, and by women for a good husband. On the other-hand, he is also the fierce ‘pitiless Vāyu’, the bone-breaker (Astovidhātu) who slays the man (the bone-crushing facet is well represented in the earthly emanations of our Vāyu, Hanūmat and Bhīma, who more generally also have a certain malignant side to them, which, O Gautami, your ancestors are said to have faced in the case of the former). Thus, in later Iranic tradition we hear of two Vāyu-s, the Vāy i veh the good Vāyu and the Vāy i vattar, the evil Vāyu, who in the Iranic text known as the greater Bundahishn is explicitly termed Astovidhātu who causes death.
>
> Thus, even in our origin myth of Kubera, the two facets of Vāyu are clearly laid out. He originally emerges in what is evidently his malefic form showering gravel/grit and then assumes a benefic form which becomes Kubera. Notably, Kubera, like Vāyu in the RV mantra, also holds the nidhi of amṛta, which is described as the honey of Jambhala, known to the V1s who have mastered the Kaubera lore, in the Mahābhārata.”
