A high IQ u1 intellectual told me that he was inspired by the thought that a good mathematics is one whose axiomatic foundation yields a great richness & diversity of results. That's why he said he started taking H'ism & studying it deeply. 

He said you guys were able to come with a rich diversity of pantheons not once, which would be the IE foundation, but multiple times in the purANa-s &tantra-s. 

He added that most H he told this seemed uncomfortable & tried to say they were mono like his root tradition. I was apparently the 1st who was plainly poly in his encounters. We were quite in agreement with his framework. 

I was impressed by how he had studied H traditions using translations with attention to details of the pantheon -- he has been to the desh only once on a professional visit.  It shows that a high IQ individual can use his vichAra  & self-study to penetrate things that he might have no exposure in pratyakSha.
