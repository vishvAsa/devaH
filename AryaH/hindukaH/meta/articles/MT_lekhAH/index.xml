      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2008/02/13/retrospections-on-the-curtain-raiser-to-the-long-past-great-war-1/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;We began to enter the minds of our ancestors the mantra dR^iShTa-s of yore for the first time. The deva-s started unveiling themselves: the upward blaze of agni in the three stations, the power of vAyu, the all-encompassing indra, the natural conservations of mitra, the natural laws whose violations are punished by varuNa, the exhilaration of knowing the natural law in aryaman, the swift transmission of the maruts, the dissolution of natural bonds through their father, the archer rudra, the light of savitA, the warmth of puShA, distribution of energies through bhaga, the flow of time in viShNu, the Milky way and the earthly flows of sarasvatI, the chemistry of the ashvins, the clear reflection by bR^ihaspati, the revolutions and the cycles of the observable cosmos in soma and tvaShTa with the R^ibhus, the world axis and its precessions in Aja-ekapAd and ahir-budhnya, the origins in aditi and then the mysterious prajApati called ka, and national identity in the 3 goddess ilA, sarasvatI and bhAratI&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;2) Then the exploits of the great pinAkin-mahAdeva came to us. Having escaped from the worldly pursuit of riches for which our amAtya had much hope, we found ourselves in the dark defile between the two stacks where the wondrous deeds of rudra were to reveal themselves from the rudra saMhitA – the original core of the shiva purANa. The power of rudra was felt by us. We caught a glimpse of the greatness of kumara then, but we had to wait some more time till the great skanda vidyA manifested in all glory to us.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2006/12/11/devata-chitra-samgraha/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The eldest son of the great king of Nepal, pR^ithivi nArAyaNa shahA (who&#xA;defeated the British and founded the Nepal Kingdom until its recent&#xA;destruction by Marxists), pratApa siMha, compiled a voluminous work on&#xA;the mantra shAstra during his brief life. As a companion to this a&#xA;collection of pictures for the dhyAna-s on various deities was prepared&#xA;by the artists in Nepal. A copy of this collection with R1’s father is&#xA;of considerable interest in terms of tradition Hindu dhyAna art of which&#xA;not many old samples survive. That this Hindu tradition was very old is&#xA;shown by the chitra-kalA section of the viShNudharmottara. Here the&#xA;bhArgava mArkaNDeya gives a lecture on drawing and painting and&#xA;specifically provides the principal lakShaNas that should depicted in&#xA;paintings of devatAs. Most of the drawings in this collection are pretty&#xA;exquisite and depict the following deities:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The once vigorous lankan flavor of the Hindu tradition had several rituals with deshIya liturgies which were marginalized or exterminated relatively recently by the resurgent sthaviravAdin-s of the shAkyamata.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some examples included the extensive &lt;em&gt;sekra-geDi-shAntiya&lt;/em&gt;, an aindra ritual. One major center of his ritual was Padeniya in lankA where a temple housed his image. Now believed to have been absorbed into the saugata vihAra where the idol is still apparently there. He is said to have sent viShNu to aid the vijayan colonization of lankA from India &amp;amp; along with viShNu and rudra invented the brAhmI script for the lankans to write and wrote out the word svasti as an illustration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/blog_supplement/status/1704305306333815262&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A high IQ u1 intellectual told me that he was inspired by the thought that a good mathematics is one whose axiomatic foundation yields a great richness &amp;amp; diversity of results. That&amp;rsquo;s why he said he started taking H&amp;rsquo;ism &amp;amp; studying it deeply.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He said you guys were able to come with a rich diversity of pantheons not once, which would be the IE foundation, but multiple times in the purANa-s &amp;amp;tantra-s.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
