1) We began to enter the minds of our ancestors the mantra dR^iShTa-s of yore for the first time. The deva-s started unveiling themselves: the upward blaze of agni in the three stations, the power of vAyu, the all-encompassing indra, the natural conservations of mitra, the natural laws whose violations are punished by varuNa, the exhilaration of knowing the natural law in aryaman, the swift transmission of the maruts, the dissolution of natural bonds through their father, the archer rudra, the light of savitA, the warmth of puShA, distribution of energies through bhaga, the flow of time in viShNu, the Milky way and the earthly flows of sarasvatI, the chemistry of the ashvins, the clear reflection by bR^ihaspati, the revolutions and the cycles of the observable cosmos in soma and tvaShTa with the R^ibhus, the world axis and its precessions in Aja-ekapAd and ahir-budhnya, the origins in aditi and then the mysterious prajApati called ka, and national identity in the 3 goddess ilA, sarasvatI and bhAratI

2\) Then the exploits of the great pinAkin-mahAdeva came to us. Having escaped from the worldly pursuit of riches for which our amAtya had much hope, we found ourselves in the dark defile between the two stacks where the wondrous deeds of rudra were to reveal themselves from the rudra saMhitA â€“ the original core of the shiva purANa. The power of rudra was felt by us. We caught a glimpse of the greatness of kumara then, but we had to wait some more time till the great skanda vidyA manifested in all glory to us.
