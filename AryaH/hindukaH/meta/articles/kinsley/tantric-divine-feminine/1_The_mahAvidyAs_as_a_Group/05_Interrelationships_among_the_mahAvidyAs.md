+++

As a group, the Mahāvidyās present a curious collection of goddesses. If there is an internal coherence to the group that explains how its members are related to each other, it is not readily apparent. Neither in textual sources nor in the contemporary oral tradition have I been able to discover an obvious pattern or logic to the inclusion of these ten goddesses in the same group. There are hints in some texts, and some of my informants have speculated about the question. These hints and speculations cover a wide range of possibilities.





## 1. FORMS OF THE GREAT GODDESS

Many texts and the contemporary oral tradition say that the Mahāvidyās are "all forms of the goddess," that "they are all one." Indeed, this is clearly the case. One Mahavidya is often explicitly equated with another or with several others. To take just one example, among the names of Bhuvanesvari in her *sahasranama **stotra *from the *Rudrayamala *are Matarigi \(v. 10\), Bhairavi \(v. 12\), Kalika \(v. 15\), Ugra-tara \(v. 19\), Tara \(v. 20\), Sundari \(v. 10\), Chinnamasta \(v. 60\), and Kamala \(v. 6\).59 The impression is difficult to avoid that each Mahavidya is one facet of a multifaceted Great Goddess and that each facet contains all the others—that if one observes intensely and carefully enough, one will find all forms inhering in each particular form.

What continues to be perplexing, however, is why this particular combination often goddesses has come to express the rather basic *sakta *theological theme that the Great Goddess has many forms. With the exception of Kali, Kamala, and to some extent Tripura-sundar i and Tara, the goddesses who make up this group are not very well known. Indeed, some of the Mahāvidyās are obscure. If the intention of Mahavidya mythology and iconography is to illustrate the idea that the goddess takes many forms, one would have thought that some of the more popular goddesses, such as Durga and Sarasvatl, would have been included in the group. The choice of the ten goddesses who make up the Mahāvidyās as illustrative of this idea, then, is not obvious and still begs the question concerning the essential interrelatedness of the group.



## 2. ŚAIVITE ASSOCIATIONS

Versions 1-3 of the origin of the Mahāvidyās stress that they issue from Siva's wife or consort and are all forms of this goddess. It therefore seems that one characteristic of the group that lends it coherence is that all of the Mahāvidyās are wives or consorts of Siva, or strongly associated with Siva. The problem here is that when we look at the Mahāvidyās individually, as we shall do below, we find that some of the Mahāvidyās have a stronger affiliation with Siva than others, that Dhumavati is a widow and has no consort \(although, as we shall see, one of her individual origin myths relates her to Satl\), and that Kamala is the wife of Vishnu, not Siva. Moreover, an explanation of the interrelationship of the Mahāvidyās as centered in their relationship to Siva breaks down outside these three versions. The emphasis on the independence of the goddess from whom the Mahāvidyās arise, and on the independence of several individual Mahāvidyās, also tends to attenuate this feature as the key to explaining the logic of their interrelationship.





## 3. SISTERS

In answer to my question concerning how the Mahāvidyās relate to each other, a priest at the Dhumavatl temple in Varanasi suggested that they are all sisters. Other groups of goddess sisters exist in Hinduism. The seven goddesses who form a protective circle in the desert around the city of Jaiselmer in western Rajasthan, for example, are said to be sisters. The priest at the Dhumavati temple said that Laksmi \(Kamala\) is the older sister of Dhumavatl and that Sodasl \(Sundari\) is younger than the others. He was uncertain about the relative ages of the other Mahāvidyās. This idea is not found in textual sources and seems unknown to most of my contemporary informants. It therefore seems less than satisfying as the key to understanding the interrelationship of the Mahāvidyās.



## 4. STAGES IN WOMEN'S LIVES

A related idea is that the Mahāvidyās represent different stages or aspects of a woman's life cycle. In ancient Greek religion, the divine feminine was said to reveal herself in three main forms, corresponding to the "three ages of woman": maiden, mother, and crone. I have also learned that the Nine Durgas, a group of goddesses in Varanasi who are said to be different forms of Durga,60 are considered by a female devotee of Durga to represent the differing stages of the goddess's \(and by extension a woman's\) life cycle.61 This scheme has some plausibility vis-a-vis certain goddesses in the Mahavidya group. Dhumavatl, for example, might represent the goddess in old age. She is usually shown as aged and is nearly always described as a widow. Other members of the group, particularly Sodasl \(Sundari\), are said to be sixteen years old. Other Mahāvidyās, such as Bhairavl in her form as Annapurna-bhairavl, have matronly qualities.

One problem is that other members of the group do not seem to fit this scheme. Moreover, there is little or no emphasis on the motherhood of the Mahāvidyās. Although they are sometimes called Ma, they are not shown with infants or children, and their independence from male consorts is stressed. The married and motherly aspects of the female life cycle are minimized in the mythology of the Mahāvidyās. This scheme also, then, seems unsatisfactory as the key to understanding the interrelationships of the group.





## 5. STAGES OF CREATION AND DESTRUCTION

One of the most common *sakta *theological formulas for presenting or describing the multiform nature of the Mahadevi is to think of her as functioning in three ways, corresponding to the functions of the male *trimmti *\(the great male deities, "having three forms": Brahma, the creator; Visnu, the maintainer; Siva, the destroyer\). That is, in her creative aspect the Great Goddess manifests herself as MahasarasvarJ \(corresponding to Brahma\), in her role as maintainer of the cosmos, as Mahalaksmi \(corresponding to Visnu\), and as destroyer of the cosmos, as Mahakali \(corresponding to Siva\). It has been suggested to me that the Mahāvidyās might be divided along these lines, that they represent symbols of the cosmic process of creation, preservation, and destruction, which the goddess oversees or embodies. Indeed, a contemporary practical guide to Tantra for aspirants says: "Mahamaya becomes Sodasl and creates the world, then she becomes Bhuvanesvari and maintains the world, and then she becomes Chinnamasta to destroy the world."62

Another author supports this idea. He sees seven stages of creation and three stages of dissolution of the universe symbolically expressed in the Mahāvidyās as given in their usual order: Kali represents the primordial void prior to creation, Tara represents the first manifestations of creation, Tripura-sundari represents the creation of time, and so on.63 The problem with this particular attempt is that the last mentioned of the Mahāvidyās, Kamala, is thereby associated with destruction, exactly the opposite of her character: she is traditionally associated with abundance and fertility. The other Mahāvidyās also do not fit at all neatly into this scheme, so it seems highly unlikely that the usual sequence in which they are named is meant to suggest seven stages of creation and three of dissolution.

It is possible to categorize some individual Mahāvidyās under the three functions of creation, maintenance, and destruction. That is, some of them are associated with preservation, such as Laksmi; others with destruction, such as Kali and Tara; others with creation, such as Bhuvanesvari and Sodasi. Few of the individual Mahāvidyās, however, are primarily images of cosmogonic functions. Kali and Kamala are members of the well-known *sakta **trimurti, *the tripartite cosmogonic formula that says that Mahasarasvati creates the world, Mahalaksmi maintains it, and Mahakali destroys it, but the other members of the group do not neatly fit the formula. Some of the individual Mahāvidyās have little or no apparent connection with any cosmogonic function. Therefore, this approach to the interrelationship of the Mahāvidyās also seems unsatisfying.





On the other hand, some individual Mahāvidyās are associated with all three goddesses \(Mahasarasvati, Mahalaksmi, and Mahakali\) and all three of their cosmic functions. So, for example, in the *sahasrandma **sto**tra *of Bhuvanesvari from the *Rudraydmala, *Bhuvanesvari is called Sarasvati \(v. 16\), She Who Creates and Sustains the World \(v. 52\), Kamala \(v. 6\), Mahalaksmi \(v. 65\), and Kalika \(v. 18\).64 In fact, the tendency is usually to associate a particular Mahavidya with a wide range of characteristics and functions and to equate her with all three cosmic functions, not just one.



## 6. THE THREE *GUNAS *

A related approach to explaining the interconnections among, or the underlying logic of, the Mahāvidyās is to think of them as symbols of the three *gunas *\(qualities\). In this approach, each Mahavidya corresponds to one of the three constituents of the created universe: *sattva *\(purity\), *rajas *\(energy\), or *tamas *\(ignorance\). Indeed, the three goddesses of the *sakta **trimurti *discussed above are also sometimes associated with the three *gunas: *Mahasarasvati with *sattva, *Mahalaksmi with *rajas, *and Mahakali with *tamas. *The three *gunas *are often related to colors: *sattva *is white, *rajas *is red, and *tamas *is black. In the case of the Mahāvidyās, John Woodroffe says that according to the *Kamadhenu-tantra *Tara is identified with *sattva **guna *and the achieving of *kaivalya, *yogic bliss; Sodasi, Bhuvanesvari, and Chinnamasta are associated with *rajas **guna; *and Dhumavatl, Kamala, Bagala, and Matarigl are related to *tamas**guna,*,65 The *Mahanirvdna-tantra *associates the individual Mahāvidyās with the three *gunas *in the same way.66 It has also been suggested to me that the complexions of the Mahāvidyās, which vary in color, might be the key to identifying them with the three *gunas. *So, for example, Kali, Tara, and Matarigl, who have black or dark complexions, would be associated with the *tamas **guna, *while Bhairavi, who has a red complexion, would be associated with the *rajas **guna. *Mahāvidyās with golden or light complexions, such as Bagala, Dhumavati, and Chinnamasta, would be related to *sattva **guna. *

This of course divides the Mahāvidyās quite differently from Woodroffe's scheme based on the *Knmadhenu-tantra. *Another problem that arises here concerns the compatibility of the color of an individual Mahavidya's complexion with what we know of her nature and functions. Kali, who would be linked with *tamas, *is known in many texts as the symbol of the highest knowledge, while the *tamas **guna *is equated with delusion, lust, and sloth. Bagalamukhi, who is usually said to have a golden or light complexion, is often associated with the acquisition of magical powers with which one can satisfy worldly desires, but the *sattva **guna, *with which she would be identified in terms of her color, is related to purely spiritual qualities. So this formula also cannot easily be applied to the Mahāvidyās to explain their coherence as a group.





## 7. THREE MOODS

Yet another tripartite scheme used to describe the nature of the goddess and her many manifestations is found in the *Kdlikd-purdna, *where it is said that the Mahadevi has three forms or moods: amorous, angry, and benevolent. She assumes these forms, the text says, according to her whims. In her amorous form she holds a yellow garland and stands on a red lotus on a white corpse. In her angry form she holds a sword and stands directly on a corpse. In her benevolent mood she rides a lion.67 The *Kdlikd-purdna *also says that the goddess Tripura is adored in three aspects: Tripura-bala \(the virgin\), Tripura-sundari \(the beautiful\), and Tripura-bhairavi \(the terrible\).68

This schema applies fairly well to certain Mahāvidyās, such as Dhumavatl and Kali, who are primarily terrible manifestations. But when we look at each of the Mahāvidyās in detail, it becomes obvious that they usually have all three of these characteristics. In many cases, it is difficult to determine which of the three "moods" a Mahavidya best expresses. While the schema is certainly suggestive, I do not find in it the key to explaining the inner coherence of the ten goddesses who form the .VLihavidyas.



## 8. FIERCE AND PEACEFUL FORMS

Another common way of schematizing the various forms of the Mahadevi in *sdkta *theology is to say that she reveals or expresses herself in fierce *\(raudra\) *and peaceful *\(saumya\) *forms.69 Similarly, informants have suggested to me that the Mahāvidyās may be divided into fierce and peaceful manifestations of the Mahadevi. According to this scheme, Kali, Tara, Bagala, Chinnamasta, and Dhumavati might be included under the *raudra *forms of the Mahadevl, while Sodasl, Bhuvanesvari, Kamala, Matarigi, and Bhairavi might be included under the *saumya *forms.





Apart from the fact that I have not found any texts that apply this schema to the Mahāvidyās, certain Mahāvidyās are difficult to classify as either fierce or peaceful. Sometimes an individual Mahavidya has several different forms, some more fierce than others. Others seem ambiguous vis-a-vis such a dichotomy; for example, Dhumavati is described as quarrelsome and has inauspicious characteristics, but she is not actually said to be fearsome or terrible. Bhairavi also presents somewhat of a problem, for although her name means "the frightful one," her descriptions often depict her as peaceful. Also, if the primary purpose of selecting ten goddesses to illustrate this dichotomy were the rationale for the Mahāvidyās, it is strange that certain goddesses who are unambiguous examples of either the *raudra *type, such as Camunda, or of the *saumya *type, such as Sarasvati, are omitted from the group. It is true that the Mahāvidyās include examples of both the *raudra *and *saumya *types, but as a structure to explain all ten of the goddesses the polarity remains unsatisfying.



## 9. DYNAMIC AND STATIC ASPECTS OF THE DIVINE

Another way of classifying goddesses is to think of them as expressing either the dynamic or static nature of reality. A tantric scholar in Varanasi suggested to me that the goddesses among the Mahāvidyās who sit or stand on or otherwise dominate a male figure \(these would include Kali, Tara, Bagala, Bhairavl, Tripura-sundari, and sometimes Chinnamasta\) might illustrate the dynamic aspect of the goddess, while the others \(Dhumavati, Matarigi, Kamala, and Bhuvanesvari\) illustrate the static aspect. Again, while this schema might be helpful in suggesting how certain *sakta *theological themes are reflected in the Mahāvidyās, it applies more clearly to certain Mahāvidyās than others and seems forced in cases where the particular goddess illustrates neither pole in any clear way.



## 10. KNOWLEDGE AND IGNORANCE \(CONCEALMENT\)

Another way of classifying manifestations of the goddess according to two polarities is to say that her forms are *vidya *or *avidyd, * that is, some of her manifestations are meant to get rid of ignorance and delusion and grant liberating knowledge \(the *vidya *forms\), while other forms are meant to veil reality and delude beings as to its true nature \(the *avidya *forms\).70 According to this scheme, Kali might belong to the former type of manifestation, symbolizing the nature of ultimate truth, while Kamala, who is approached primarily for worldly rewards, might belong to the latter. The other Mahāvidyās might be arranged in similar fashion. The problem here is that a goddess such as Kali, about whom so much is written, and who has such an ancient and widespread cult, clearly plays both roles. To assign a particular Mahavidya to one pole or the other is difficult in many cases. Which type of goddess, *vidya *or *avidya, *for example, is Dhumavati or Matarigl? A case might be made for either pole. Likewise with most of the Mahāvidyās. Also, I have yet to find any text that divides the Mahāvidyās in this fashion.





## 11. THE LUNAR PHASES

A tantric scholar suggested to me yet another approach to explaining the interrelationships of the Mahāvidyās, one that identifies them with the different lunar *tithis *\(the thirty days of the waxing and waning moon\). According to this scholar, Kali is identified with the new moon *\(amavasya\) *and Sodasl with the full moon *ipurnima\). *These two goddesses represent completeness of knowledge, according to this scheme, in two different ways, both equally valid. Kali represents complete knowledge in terms of transcendence. Like the new moon, she is beyond what can be perceived and circumscribed. Or perhaps one could say that Kali represents knowledge gained by getting rid of all false knowledge, by shedding ignorance, while Sodasi represents knowledge gained by acquiring increasing amounts of knowledge until one is filled with wisdom. The former would be suggested in the *tithis *of the waning phase of the moon, while the latter \(Sodasi\) would be suggested in the *tithis *of the waxing moon. Sodasi, whose name means "the sixteenth," represents complete knowledge or wisdom in terms of being all-inclusive. As the sixteenth, she includes all the other fifteen *tithis. *The other Mahāvidyās are associated with the waxing and waning lunar *tithis *according to which of the poles they most resemble. The tantric scholar suggested that Chinnamasta, who is close in nature or meaning to Kall, would represent the first and second waning lunar *tithis, *while Bhuvanesvari and Kamala, both of whom are associated with abundance, would represent the last four *tithis *prior to the full moon.





Again, although this approach may be helpful in the case of a few of the Mahāvidyās, it seems forced in most. The extent to which a particular Mahavidya approximates knowledge as transcendent or knowledge as all-inclusive is usually difficult to determine.



## 12. LEFT- AND RIGHT-HANDED GODDESSES

Some informants have suggested to me that the Mahavidyas are interconnected through their association with the right- or lefthanded paths in Tantrism. Tantrism describes two paths, left and right, as means to achieving spiritual fulfillment. The left-handed path is restricted to those of heroic nature, is described as dangerous, and employs the infamous *paiica **tattva *ritual in which the aspirant partakes of five forbidden things: meat, fish, wine, a particular type of grain \(possibly a drug of some kind\), and illicit sexual intercourse. Tantric texts sometimes specify which path should be used in worshiping particular Mahāvidyās. The *Saktisamgama-tantra, *for example, says that Kali, Tara, Sundari, Bhairavl, Chinnamasta, Matarigl, and Bagala are fond of the left-handed path, while Bhuvanesvarl, Dhumavati, and Kamala should be worshiped by the right-handed path.711 Iowever, in many cases texts specify that both paths are appropriate, and in practice most of the goddesses who belong to the Mahāvidyās are worshiped by practitioners of both paths. It is difficult, therefore, to designate particular Mahāvidyās as belonging either to the left- or the right-handed paths.

If one is attempting to divide the Mahāvidyās between right and left, it is relevant to consider images in which they are arrayed in the ten directions, with a goddess or Siva in the center. One might expect that the goddesses on the central deity's left side are those worshiped primarily by means of the left-handed path and those on the right, by the righthanded path, but that is not the case. According to the *Mahabhagavata**pwmia, *Tara, Sodas, and Tripura-sundari are located to the left \(the east\), while Bhairavl, Chinnamasta, and Bhuvanesvari are to the right. These six goddesses do not correspond in any consistent way to the left- and right-handed paths.



## 13. STAGES OF CONSCIOUSNESS

Finally, the Mahāvidyās might be understood as symbols of the stages \(or types\) of consciousness experienced by tantric aspirants in their progressive spiritual development. Each goddess confers a certain type of perfection, blessing, or awareness. These perfections *\(siddhis\) *or types of consciousness, meditative states, or moods *\(bhavas\)12 *might be understood as progressive, some presupposing or being more inclusive than others. Several informants independently of each other suggested this approach to the Mahāvidyās, and it has some textual support.73 In this approach, Kali is understood to represent unfettered, complete knowledge of self and of ultimate reality, fully enlightened consciousness that has transcended all limitations of egocentricity.74 She is symbolic of the ultimate goal of tantric *sadhand *\(spiritual exercise\). Tara, who is very similar to Kali in appearance, symbolizes a high or expanded state of awareness, but a state that has not entirely transcended physical and personal limitations. Bagalamukhi represents a state of sharply focused consciousness, an intensified will that is capable of directly influencing people with whom the adept comes in contact. Kamala and Bhairavi symbolize lower states of consciousness, in which the adept is preoccupied with satisfying bodily and mental needs. The other Mahāvidyās symbolize states of consciousness that arise between the adept's preoccupation with worldly, bodily, or personal needs and desires and the eventual dawning of the fully enlightened consciousness represented by Kali.





In tantric religion, the progressive nature of *sadhand *is often described as the awakening, arising, and ascent of *kundalini **sakti. *This female power or energy is depicted as a coiled and slumbering serpent at the base of the spine in a *cakra *\(center\), pictured as a lotus. Through meditative techniques, the aspirant awakens this power and causes it to ascend by way of the central channel, the *susumnd **nadi, *which traverses the body along the line of the backbone. As the *kundalini *rises, it passes through six other *cakras, *also represented as lotuses, and awakens or invigorates them as it reaches them. Different *bhavas, *"spiritual moods" or states of consciousness, are sometimes associated with the awakening of each *cakra. *According to one adept, when *kundalini **sakti *awakens in the *muladhdra **cakra, *one experiences a feeling of dissatisfaction with ordinary life. That is, *kundalini**sadhana *represents a desire to go beyond or to expand normal consciousness.75 Ultimately, the *sadhaka *\(aspirant\) seeks to have the *kundalini *rise to the topmost *cakra *at the crown of the head, where she unites with Siva and creates the bliss of awakening *\(mahasukha\). *

In interpreting the iMahavidyas as states of consciousness, meditative states, or mental perfections *\(siddhis\), *one might think of them as symbols of the nature of the mental states associated with the seven *cakras *of *kundalini*yoga.76 There is, in fact, evidence that the Mahāvidyās are associated with the *cakras, *and with the *kundalini *generally. It is said of Bhuvanesvari, for example, that she sleeps in the *muladhdra **cakra, *the lowest *cakra, *where the *kundalhn *sleeps.77 It is also said that Bhuvanesvari cuts the knots of \(or awakens\) the *cakras *and rises to meet Siva, which means that she is equated with the *kundalini.78 *Another example is Tripurabhairavl, who is called Sat-cakra-krama-vasinl \(she who abides in the six *cakras\).79 *





Lending credibility to this approach to the Mahāvidyās is the *tantras'' *ranking of different paths. Many *tantras *name seven \(sometimes nine\) different paths and describe and rank them, usually from inferior \(in which the aims are worldly\) to superior \(in which the aims are transcendent\). A standard list of the seven paths, in ascending order, is: Vedacara, Vaisnavacara, Saivacara, Daksinacara, Vamacara, Siddhantacara, and Kaulacara. The *Saktisamgama-tantra *says that the highest path, the Kaulacara, comprises the *kula, *the family of worshipers, who know the truth that reality is comprised *ois'akti *and Siva.80 The *Mahdnirvdna-tantra *says that the Kaulacara path includes the performance of the *panca **makdra *\(five essentials\) ritual and is only entered upon after the aspirant has been initiated by a guru.81

A good example of goddesses representing progressive states of perfection is found in the Srividya cult. In ritually and meditatively moving from the outward parts of the Srividya *cakra, *which represents the entire cosmos, to the center, the adept acquires different *siddhis, *or perfections. The outer *siddhis *are less powerful and more worldly in nature, while the inner *siddhis *are both more spiritual and more powerful. These *siddhis, *furthermore, are personified as goddesses.82

There is even a tradition that associates particular goddesses with each of the seven *cakras. *Dakinl is associated with the *muladhdra **cakra, *Rakinl with the *svddhisthdna **cakra, *Laksml with the *manipura **cakra, *Kakinl with the *anahata **cakra, *Sakini with the *visuddha **cakra, *Hakim with the *djnd **cakra, *and Nirvana-sakti with the *sahasrdra **cakra.83 *For the most part, these goddesses are hardly known outside this context, and of the seven, only Laksml, whom we may identify with Kamala, is a Mahavidya.

What is missing in order to make the association of the Mahāvidyās with the *cakras *and ascending states of consciousness a convincing interpretation of the interrelationship of the Mahāvidyās is a clear tradition that asserts a hierarchy or progressive ranking of the ten goddesses84 and consistently identifies each one with specific paths, *siddhis, *or *cakras. *Although a certain Mahavidya may sometimes be identified with a particular path, *siddhi, *or *cakra, *there is seldom a consistent pattern, except, perhaps, in the case of Kali, who is often identified with the Kaulacara path, which is considered the highest. Although we find Mahāvidyās associated with *kundalini **sakti, *the *miiladhara **cakra, *or the *cakras *generally, it is rare to find Mahāvidyās assigned to each of the other *cakras *in a predictable way. It is also curious that there are ten, not seven, Mahāvidyās if they are meant to be symbols of the progressive stages of consciousness experienced by aspirants in *kundalini **yoga. *Although I am inclined to see in this approach a helpful framework for thinking about the meaning of the Mahāvidyās as a group and as individual goddesses, the evidence is too thin to say with assurance that this is the key to understanding how they relate to each other within the group.





We seem left, then, with no entirely satisfactory key to understanding the connections among the Mahāvidyās. Perhaps the best we can hope for is to combine all the possibilities we have mentioned, or some subset of them, in our efforts to discern the coherence of the group, to understand how such a curious mix of goddesses has come together to form the ten Mahāvidyās.
