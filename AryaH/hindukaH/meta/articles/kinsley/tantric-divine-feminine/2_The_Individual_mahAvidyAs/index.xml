      <description>&lt;p&gt;***The **Black **Goddess ***&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;She is the terrible one who has a dreadful face. She should be meditated upon as having disheveled hair and a garland of freshly cut human heads. She has four arms. In her upper left hand she holds a sword that has just been bloodied by the severed head that she holds in her lower left hand. Her upper right hand makes the gesture of assurance and her lower right hand, the sign of granting favors. She has a bluish complexion and is lustrous like a dark cloud. She is completely naked, and her body gleams with blood that is smeared all over it from the garland of bleeding severed heads around her neck. Her ear ornaments are the corpses of children. Her fangs are dreadful, and her face is fierce. Her breasts are large and round, and she wears a girdle made of severed human hands. Blood trickles from the corners of her mouth and makes her face gleam. She makes a terrible sound and lives in the cremation ground, where she is surrounded by howling jackals. She stands on the chest of Siva in the form of a corpse. She is eager to have sexual intercourse in reverse fashion with Mahakala. She wears a satisfied expression. She smiles.1&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;***The **Goddess **Who **Guides **through **Troubles ***&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In lists of the Mahavidyas, Tara almost always follows Kali. This suggests a certain importance in the group. Indeed, she is more like Kali in appearance than any of the other Mahavidyas. As we shall see below, interpretations of her significance often come close to those of Kali.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Tara occupies a central place in Tibetan Buddhism and to a great extent plays the role of a Tibetan national deity. In her Buddhist context, she is almost always a benevolent, compassionate, gentle, playful young woman who indulges her devotees and never lets them come to harm. In her Hindu context, on the other hand, particularly as one of the Mahavidyas, Tara is almost always fierce, often horrible to behold, and potentially dangerous. Although Tara also has fierce aspects in Buddhism and benign ones in Hinduism, she generally manifests gentle features in the former and fierce ones in the latter. Historically, it is likely that the Hindu Mahavidya Tara developed from the Buddhist bodhisattva Tara and that the Hindu preference was for her fierce manifestations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;***She **Who **Is **Lovely **in **the **Three **Worlds ***&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Tripura-sundari, who also appears in lists of the Mahavidyas under the names Sodasi, Lalita, Kamesvari, Srividya, and Rajarajesvari, is often cited third, after Kali and Tārā. She is also sometimes said to be, along with Kali and Tārā, an *adi *(primordial) Mahavidya, which suggests that she occupies a high place in the group, that she, like them, represents a complete vision of reality.1 According to other sources, she represents the penultimate vision of enlightened consciousness, a stage of consciousness suffused with *sattvic *qualities but lacking the completeness of fully enlightened consciousness, represented by Kali, which is beyond all quality and form, *nirguna.1 *&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;***She **Whose **Body **Is **the **World ***&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Her complexion is vermillion in color. She has three eyes and wears a crown resplendent with jewels. She has the disk of the moon on her brow and has a smiling face. Her breasts are high and firm. In her two hands she holds a red lotus and a bowl filled with jewels. She is very peaceful and amiable. Her right foot rests on a jeweled jar. In this way one should meditate upon the supreme mother goddess.1&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;***The **Self-Decapitated **Goddess ***&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Victory to the light of the world, giver of a good ending to the universe, to her whose forehead is lovely with charming locks.1&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I meditate upon the Goddess Chinnamasta who is seated in the centre of the Sun&amp;rsquo;s disk and holds in her left hand her own severed head with gaping mouth, her hair is dishevelled and she is drinking the stream of blood gushing out from her own neck. She is seated on Rati and Kamadeva who are engaged in sexual dalliance, and she is rejoicing with her friends Dakini and Varnini.2&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;***The **Fierce **One ***&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;She has a luminous complexion like a thousand rising suns. She wears silken red clothes and a garland of severed heads. Her breasts are smeared with blood. She has four arms: in two of her hands she holds a rosary and a book, and with her other two hands she makes the gestures of assurance and conferring boons. She has three eyes that resemble large lotuses. On her forehead is the half-moon and on her head a jeweled crown. She smiles.1&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;***The **Widow **Goddess ***&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Dhumavati is ugly, unsteady, and angry. She is tall and wears dirty clothes. Her ears are ugly and rough, she has long teeth, and her breasts hang down. She has a long nose. She has the form of a widow. She rides in a chariot that has a banner on top decorated with a crow emblem. Her eyes are fearsome, and her hands tremble. In one hand she holds a winnowing basket, and with the other hand she makes the gesture of conferring boons. Her nature is rude. She is always hungry and thirsty and looks unsatisfied. She likes to create strife, and she is always frightful in appearance.1&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;***The **Paralyzer ***&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the middle of the ocean is a pavilion of jewels with an altar inside it. On the altar is a lion throne on which the goddess Bagalamukhi is seated. Her complexion is completely yellow, perfectly yellow, and she wears a yellow dress, yellow ornaments, and a yellow garland. I call to mind she who holds the tongue of the enemy in her left hand and a raised club in her right hand.1&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;***The **Lotus **Goddess ***&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;She has a beautiful golden complexion. She is being bathed by four large elephants who pour jars of nectar over her. In her four hands she holds two lotuses and makes the signs of granting boons and giving assurance. She wears a resplendant crown and a silken dress. I pay obeisance to her who is seated on a lotus in a lotus posture.1&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let Kamala protect us by her wonderful side-glances that delight the heart of Visnu. She is seated on a lotus, has a smiling face, and with her four hands holds two lotuses and makes the signs of giving favors and granting assurance. Her complexion is like the brightness of lightning. Her breasts are firm and heavy and are decorated with garlands of pearls.2&lt;/p&gt;</description>
