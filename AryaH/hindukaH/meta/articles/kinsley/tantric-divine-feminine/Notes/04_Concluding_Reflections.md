21. The *asta **siddhis, *which are superior powers or "perfections" achieved by means of yoga, include some of these abilities and are ancient in the Hindu tradition. A well-known example of the ability to change form at will, including changing into animal form, is Mahisasura, the buffalo demon whom Durga slays in the *Devi-mdhdtmya. *

29. Miranda Shaw, *Passionate **Enlightenment: **Women **in **Tantric **Buddhism *\(Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1994\), argues that sexual complementarity and sexual union are central to Buddhist tantric spirituality and that sexual union is used to clear the central channel *\(avadhuti\) *of all obstructions and "knots." Sexual union, she argues, is a meditative technique whereby illumination is achieved \(pp. 147, 160, 171, 186-88\).

41. It is not fair to conclude from this text, however, that only low-caste or socially marginal women took part in tantric *sadhana. *Nor would it be fair to say that low-caste or socially marginal women were never full participants in tantric *sadhana *\(as opposed to being simply "used" by male *sddhakas\). *See Shaw, passim, esp. pp. 35-68.

55. Banerjee, *A **Brief **History **of **Tantric **Literature, *p. 184. Mark Dyczkowski, the author of several books on Hindu Tantrism, has told me that both Hindu and Buddhist tantric lineages mention female teachers, although they are clearly in the minority.

56. *Prdnatosini-tantra *\(Calcutta: Basumati Sahitya Mandir, 1928\), 2.2, p. 96. It is also clear in this passage that the discussion is very much from a male point of view. The conditions under which a female may function as a guru depend on whether her husband is a guru, whether she is a widow \(and, if so, whether she has a son\), and so on. Similarly, among her commendable qualities, loyalty to her husband is mentioned first. See also N. N. Bhattacharyya, *History **of **the **Tantric **Religion: **A **Historical, **Ritualistic **and **Philosophical **Study *\(New Delhi: Manohar Publishers, 1982\), p. 121: "In the Tantric religious system a woman has the right of initiating persons into the secrets of the cult and acting as guru."
