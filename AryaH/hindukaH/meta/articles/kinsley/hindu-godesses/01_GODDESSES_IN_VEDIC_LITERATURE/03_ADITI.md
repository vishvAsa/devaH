title = "03 ADITI"

+++

Although the goddess Aditi is mentioned nearly eighty times in the *Ṛg-veda,* it is difficult to gain a clear picture of her nature. She is usually mentioned along with other gods or goddesses, there is no one hymn addressed exclusively to her, and unlike many other Vedic deities she is not obviously associated with some natural phenomenon. Compared to Uṣas and Pṛthivī, her character seems ill defined. She is virtually featureless physically.

Perhaps the most outstanding attribute of Aditi is her motherhood. She is preeminently the mother of the Ādityas, a group of seven or eight gods which includes Mitra, Aryaman, Bhaga, Varuna, Dakṣa, and Aṁśa \(2.27.1\). Aditi is also said to be the mother of the great god Indra, the mother of kings \(2.27\), and the mother of the gods \(1.113.19\). Unlike Pṛthivī, however, whose motherhood is also central to her nature, Aditi does not have a male consort in the *Ṛg-veda.*

As a mothering presence, Aditi is often asked to guard the one who petitions her \(1.106.7; 8.18.6\) or to provide him or her with wealth, safety, and abundance \(10.100; 1.94.15\). Appropriate to her role as a mother, Aditi is sometimes associated with or identified as a cow. As a cow she provides nourishment, and as the cosmic cow her milk is identified with the redemptive, invigorating drink *soma* \(1.153.3\).

The name Aditi is derived from the root *dā* \(to bind or fetter\) and suggests another aspect of her character. As *a-diti,* she is the unbound, free one, and it is evident in the hymns to her that she is often called upon to free the petitioner from different hindrances, especially sin and sickness \(2.27.14\). In one hymn she is asked to free a petitioner who is tied up like a thief \(8.67.14\). In this role as the one who binds and loosens Aditi is similar in function to Varuna, who in fact is one of her sons. Aditi thus plays the role of guardian of *ṛta*, the cosmic-moral order. As such she is called a supporter of creatures \(1.136\). She supports creatures by providing or enforcing *rta,* those ordinances or rhythms that delineate order from chaos.

Aditi is also called widely expanded \(5.46.6\) and extensive, the mistress of wide stalls \(8.67.12\), and in this respect one is reminded of Pṛthivī. In fact, Aditi and Pṛthivī become virtually identified in the *Brāhmaṇas*.3
