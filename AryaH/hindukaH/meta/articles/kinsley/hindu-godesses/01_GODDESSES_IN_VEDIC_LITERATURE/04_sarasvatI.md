The close association between natural phenomena and such Vedic goddesses as Uṣas and Pṛthivī is also seen in the goddess Sarasvatī, who is associated with a particular river. Although scholars have debated precisely which river she was identified with in Vedic times \(the Sarasvatī River of that period has since disappeared\), in the *Ṛg-veda* her most important characteristics are those of a particular mighty river. Indeed, at times it is not clear whether a goddess or a river is being praised; many references hail the Sarasvatī River as a mighty goddess.

Sarasvatī is called mighty and powerful. Her waves are said to break down mountains, and her flood waters are described as roaring \(6.61.2, 8\). She is said to surpass all waters in greatness, to be ever active, and to be great among the great. She is said to be inexhaustible, having her source in the celestial ocean \(7.95.1–2; 5.43.11\). She is clearly no mere river but a heaven-sent stream that blesses the earth. Indeed, she is said to pervade the triple creation of earth, atmosphere, and the celestial regions \(6.61.11–12\).

She is praised for the fertility she brings the earth. She is praised or petitioned for wealth, vitality, children, nourishment, and immortality, and as such she is called *subhaga* \(bountiful\). As a fecund, bountiful presence, she is called mother, the best of mothers \(2.41.16\). As a nourishing, maternal goddess, she is described in terms similar to Pṛthivī: she quickens life, is the source of vigor and strength, and provides good luck and material well-being to those whom she blesses. In one particular hymn she is called upon by unmarried men who yearn for sons. They ask to enjoy her breast that is swollen with streams and to receive from her food and progeny \(7.96.4–6; 1.164.49\). She is sometimes petitioned for protection and in this aspect is called a sheltering tree \(7.95.5\) and an iron fort \(7.95.1\), neither image being particularly fluvial.

Sarasvatī is also closely related to Vedic cult, both as a participant in or witness of the cult and as a guardian of the cult. She is invoked with and associated with the sacrificial goddesses Idā and Bhāratī and with the goddesses Mahī and Hotrā, who are associated with prayer \(7.37.11; 10.65.13\). She is said to destroy those who revile the gods and to be a slayer of Vṛtra, a demon of chaos.

Sarasvatī is described particularly as a purifying presence \(1.3.10\). Her waters cleanse poison from men \(6.61.3\). Along with rivers and floods in general, she cleanses her petitioners with holy oil and bears away defilements \(10.17.10\)

Anticipating her later nature as a goddess of inspiration, eloquence, and learning, the hymns of the *Ṛg-veda* also describe Sarasvatī as the inciter of all pleasant songs, all gracious thought, and every pious thought \(1.3.10–12\). In this vein she is similar to the Vedic goddess Vāc \(speech\), with whom she is consistently identified in the *Brāhmaṇas.*4
