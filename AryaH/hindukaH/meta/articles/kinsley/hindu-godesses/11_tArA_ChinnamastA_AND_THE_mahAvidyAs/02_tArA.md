The goddess Tārā does not figure prominently in the Hindu tradition. Her place in Tibetan Buddhism, however, is central and quite ancient. Her appearance in the list of the Mahāvidyās can probably be explained, at least in part, by the religious communication that existed for centuries between Tibet and Bengal \(where the texts that mention the Mahāvidyās were written\). Many important Buddhist missionaries to Tibet came from Bengal, and Buddhists continued to be mentioned in Bengali texts until the sixteenth century.22 In the late medieval period, when such texts as the *Mahābhāgavata-purāṇa* and the *Bṛhaddharma-purāṇa* were written, Tārā was probably fairly well known in Bengal. Rāmprasād Sen, the eighteenth-century Bengali devotee of Kālī, often used the name Tārā as an epithet of Kālī, and it seems clear that for him the two goddesses were more or less the same and that he understood Tara to be as much a Hindu goddess as a Buddhist goddess.

The earliest reference to Tārā is found in Subandhu’s *Vasavadattā*, which was probably written around the middle of the seventh century. The reference occurs as part of a pun and situates Tārā in the context of Buddhist devotion. The passage reads: “The Lady Twilight was seen, devoted to the stars and clad in red sky, as a Buddhist nun \(is devoted to Tārā and is clad in red garments\).”23 In Buddhist Tantric mythology Tārā belongs to the family of the Dhyāni Buddha Amoghasiddhi, but she is also related to the bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara, who is in the family of the Dhyāni Buddha Amitābha. In one account all the creatures lament the thought of Avalokiteśvara’s abandoning them as he is about to achieve *nirvāṇa*. Hearing them, Avalokiteśvara sheds a tear of compassion for all beings. That tear becomes Tara, who is thus understood to be the essence of the essence of compassion.24 As we shall see, Tārā’s essential nature in Tibetan Buddhism is that of a compassionate savior who rescues her devotees from peril. Her inclusion in the Amitābha family therefore seems fitting, since both Amitābha and Avalokiteśvara are renowned for their great compassion.

Tibetan Buddhists know other legendary or mythological accounts of Tārā’s origin. One legend identified Tārā with the wives of the first great Tibetan king, Songsten gampo \(A.D. 617–650\). The king himself is said to have been an incarnation of Avalokiteśvara, while his Chinese wife is said to have been an incarnation of Green Tārā and his Nepalese wife an incarnation of White Tārā \(there are several different forms of Tārā, as we shall see\).25 Another Tibetan legend says that the Tibetan people arose from the union of a monkey and a rock ogress. This legend is ancient and pre-Buddhist in origin. By the fourteenth century, when Buddhism had come to dominate Tibet, however, the monkey had come to be identified with Avalokiteśvara and the rock ogress, despite her lustful nature, with an incarnation of the goddess Tārā.26 What is interesting about these Tibetan legends is that they associate Tārā with the origins of the Tibetan people and the Tibetan royal line. They affirm that Tārā is dear to the Tibetan people in a special way. She is in a historical or legendary sense their queen and mother.27

Historically, the cult of Tārā in Tibetan Buddhism dates to the eighth century, that is, to around the time when Buddhism was introduced to Tibet from India. Until the time of Atīśa \(eleventh century\), however, the worship of Tārā does not seem to have been very widespread in Tibet. Atīśa is traditionally associated with bringing the cult of Tārā to Tibet, and biographical accounts emphasize his many visions of Tārā and his special devotion to her. Atīśa is credited with having translated a series of Sanskrit texts concerning Tārā into Tibetan. The texts were soon circulated as a coherent cycle and came to be known by the name *Cheating Death.28* Another text that was to become very popular in Tibet was also brought there in the eleventh century. The master Darmadra brought to Tibet and translated the text *Homages to the Twenty-one Tārās*, which to this day is well known to most Tibetans.29

Despite Tārā’s many forms and functions it seems clear wherein lies her extraordinary power and appeal. She is approached primarily as a savior, as a being who specializes in spectacular, dramatic appearances when her devotees call on her in dire circumstances. Like Durgā,30 Tārā is often said to rescue her devotees from such desperate predicaments as being lost in an impenetrable forest, foundering in a storm at sea, being under threat of imminent execution, or being trapped and bound in prison.31 The many folk stories about Tārā show her typically appearing at the request of her devotees to dramatically rescue them from the jaws of certain death.32 Tārā’s compassion for suffering beings, then, is revealed primarily in her role as the cheater of death. In this sense her chief blessing to her devotees is a long life, and other stories emphasize that regular worship of Tārā brings about longevity.33 In Tibetan monastic traditions, when novices are initiated into the ceremonies in honor of Tārā, the rituals are referred to as an “initiation into life.”34 Unlike goddesses who are associated with life as embodiments of fertility, Tārā is approached primarily as the one who protects, preserves, and saves life. She is not a fertility goddess \(although she does give her blessing in this form from time to time\)35 but a greatly compassionate being who cannot tolerate the suffering of her devotees.

Tārā’s devotees approach her with great love and devotion. Tibetan Tantric Buddhism is in many respects a heroic, fierce religion involving arduous spiritual exercises. Her worship introduces into it a theme of great tenderness. An example of this devotional tenderness is the poem the *Cry of Suffering to Tārā* by the lama Lozang tenpe jets’en:



From my heart I bow to the Holy Lady, essence of compassion,

. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

until I gain the terrace of enlightenment

I pray you grasp me with the iron hook of your compassion.



From the depths of my inmost heart and bones I pray to you

. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

think of me a little, show me your smiling face,

loving one\! grant me the nectar of your voice.

. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

O holy Tārā\! you know

everything that I have done,

my happiness and suffering, my good and evil:

then think lovingly of me, my only mother\!36

Tārā’s charm and approachability are evident in her appearance and personality. Although she is often depicted in regal attire, she is usually said to be a girl of sixteen or younger. She is playful, energetic, and possesses a sense of humor. A modern story about her appearance to a young Tibetan couple whom she rescued from starvation describes her as follows:

Presently a bright light fell upon his eyes and, starting up in alarm, he beheld Tara seated negligently on the table, swinging her legs like a child with more energy than she knew what to do with. However, even as he lept up to prostrate himself, her body began to glow with light. The window behind her was dissolved in these rays and, in its place, he saw the peak of a lofty hill covered with lush green grass wherein glittered innumerable points of light as though it were bestrewn with gems. Beyond and stretching to the horizon was an expanse of deep blue water capped by magnificent white waves which, breaking on the shore below, emitted rainbow-colored clouds of spray. These clouds, rising to the hilltop, filled the air with millions upon millions of glittering particles like multi-coloured jewels. Meanwhile, the table had become a moon disc resting on a huge and many-petalled lotus, whereon Tara sat, still negligently and with the air of a young girl having fun, but now clad in shining silks and golden ornaments like the daughter of the Emperor of the Sky. She was smiling at him with a mixture of archness and contempt.37

Although Tārā’s primary appeal seems to be as the cheater of death, the prolonger of life, and although she is primarily popular as a charming, playful young girl, she does have a variety of forms, some of which are fierce, even terrifying. The *Homages to the Twenty-one Tārās*, probably her most popular hymn of praise, contains several verses that invoke Tārā in fierce forms.





Homage, Lady who annihilates the heroes of Māra,

TURE, the terrible lady,

slaying all enemies

by frowning the brows of her lotus face.

. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Homage, Lady who strikes the earth with her hand,

who pounds upon it with her feet,

shattering the seven underworlds

with the sound of HŪṂ made by her frowning brows.

. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Homage, Lady who strikes with the feet of TURE,

whose seed is the form of the syllable HŪṂ,

shaking Mount Meru, Mandāra, Kailāśa,

and all the triple world.38



Tārā. Eleventh century A.D. Pratapaditya Pal, *Nepal, Where the Gods are Young* \(New York: Asia Society, 1975\), fig. 37, p. 55. Reprinted by permission of William H. Wolff.

A particularly fierce form of Tārā is Tārā Kurukullā.39 She is described as follows:



Homage and praise to her

who stands in the dancing pose

haughty with furious rage,

who has a diadem of five skulls,

who bears a tiger’s skin.

I pay homage to the red one,

bearing her fangs, whose body is frightful,

who is adorned with the five signs of ferocity,

whose necklace is half a hundred human heads,

who is the conqueress of Māra.’40

Tārā Kurukullā’s special power lies in her ability to subjugate and destroy evil spirits or one’s personal enemies.41 The rituals in which Kurukullā is invoked involve the goddess’s coming to reside in the practitioner himself. The rituals thus require a strong and accomplished adept, for Kurukullā is a potent force. The adept dresses in red garments and visualizes himself taking on the form of the goddess. Then he recites her mantra ten thousand times. Then he makes certain offerings to her and asks her to subjugate the person or demon who is the object of the rituals.



When these preliminaries are complete, when he has firmly grasped the vivid appearance and ego of the goddess, the visualization is ready to be performed. Light radiates forth from a HRĪḤ in the practitioner’s heart and places the person to be subjugated, naked and with unbound hair, upon a wind mandala arisen from YAṂ: that is, the seed of wind transforms into the round shape symbolic of the air element, and this wind propels forward the person to be subjugated; he is bound around the neck by a noose radiated from the practitioner’s—Kurukullā’s—lotus flower, drawn forward by an iron hook stuck into his heart, summoned by the strength of the mantra, and laid down helpless upon his back before the practitioner’s feet. If the person to be subjugated is male, the text adds, Kurukullā’s iron hook is stuck into his heart; if female it is stuck into her vagina.42

Other fierce forms of Tārā include Mahāmāyā-vijayavāhinī Tārā,43 Bhīmadevī, who is also called the blue she-wolf,44 and Mahācinatārā. Mahācinatārā \(also known as Ugratārā\) is described in both Buddhist and Hindu sources. She is described in the Buddhist work *Sādhanamālā*.



The worshiper should conceive himself as \(Māhacina-Tārā\) who stands in the Pratyālīḍha attitude, and is awe-inspiring with a garland of heads hanging from the neck. She is short and has a protruding belly, and her looks are terrible. Her complexion is like that of the blue lotus, and she is three-eyed, one-faced, celestial and laughs horribly. She is in an intensely pleasant mood, stands on a corpse, is decked in ornaments of snakes, has red and round eyes, wears the garments of tiger-skin round her loins, is in youthful bloom, is endowed with the five auspicious symbols, and has a protruding tongue. She is most terrible, appears fierce, with bare canine fangs, carries the sword and the Kartri in the two right hands and the Utpala and Kapāla in the two left. Her Jaṭāmukuṭa of one coil is brown and fiery and bears the image of Akṣobhya within it.45

An almost identical description of Mahācinatārā is given in the *Tantra-sāra* of Kṛṣṇananda Āgamavāgīśa, a seventeenth-century compilation of *dhyāna-mantras* written in Bengal. Even though it is a Hindu work, the *Tantrasāra* description includes the reference to an image of Akṣobhya adorning her crown.46

Several other Hindu Tantric texts describe Tārā as fierce, and the goddess’s appearance in these texts differs only in a few particulars from Kālī’s. Such works as the *Tārārahasyavṛttikā*, the *Rudra-yāmala*, and the *Tārā-tantra* describe Tārā as “short of stature, bedecked with ornaments of serpents of various colour, bearing garlands composed of fifty human heads, severed afresh from bodies, and bleeding freely. The *devi* stands with one foot on a dead body . . . in the funeral ground.”47 Completing Tārā’s fierce description in the *Tārā-tantra*, in which barely any resemblance to the benign Tārā of Tibet remains, is her delight in receiving both the blood of sacrificial animals and the blood of her devotees. The devotees’ blood, which is to be taken from specified parts of the body such as the forehead, hands, breast, head, or area between the eyebrows, is said to be far more pleasing to the goddess than the blood of an animal victim \(5.15\). Throughout the text Tārā is to be worshiped in the context of left-handed Tantric rites, in which wine, meat, and illicit sex play an important role.

Tārā’s association with Kālī in the devotional works of Ramprasād Sen also makes it clear that the Tārā known in Hindu Bengal was a fierce goddess quite different from the gentle, youthful, playful forms of Tārā so popular in Tibet. I have a contemporary lithograph of the Mahāvidyās that shows Kālī and Tārā adjacent to each other and almost identical in appearance. Both are dark, nearly naked, have protruding tongues, hold bloodied cleavers in the upper left hand, have a garland of severed heads \(the heads of Kālī’s garland are freshly cut, while the heads of Tārā’s garland are skulls\), have disheveled hair, and stand or dance on an identical prone male body \(or corpse\). Tārā’s inclusion in the list of Mahāvidyās thus does not seem to derive from her essential popularity in Tibetan Buddhism as a gentle, compassionate deity who cheats death. The Hindu Mahāvidyā Tārā is modeled on Tārā’s fierce forms such as Kurukullā and Mahācinatārā.

The Hindu Mahāvidyā Tārā’s association with ceremonies that terrify, disable, stultify, and enchant people48 immediately brings to mind Tārā Kurukullā’s employment in rituals of subjugation in Tibetan Buddhism. Although the ritual context of worship of the Hindu Mahāvidyās is not clear, it may well be that these fierce goddesses are utilized in rituals similar to the ones featuring the fierce Tārā Kurukullā in Tibet. One of the underlying assumptions of the Tārā Kurukullā rituals of subjugation seems to be that if one wishes to exert power over another person, or if one wishes to protect oneself from supernatural beings, the most effective kind of deity one can employ is fierce and terrifying. Such beings as Tārā Kurukullā, it seems, dramatically express the aggressive emotions that must accompany rituals of subjugation and also reassure the person seeking protection from equally fierce, hostile demons.

In any case, the effect of the appearance of the Mahāvidyās on the great god Śiva is impressive. He is terrified and immediately agrees to what Satī wishes. He is subjugated by these goddesses in the same way that Tārā Kurukullā subjugates enemies when properly invoked.
