One of the most popular heroines in Hindu mythology is Sītā. She is known primarily as the wife of Rāma, the hero of the epic *Rāmāyaṇa.* As one of the protagonists of the *Rāmāyaṅa,* Sītā is revered as the model Hindu wife, who, although the victim of injustices, always remains loyal and steadfast to her husband. The divinity of Rāma and Sītā is not stressed in the early *Rāmāyaṇa* of Vālmīki \(written sometime between 200 B.C. and A.D. 200\), but they increasingly become identified as manifestations of the god Viṣṇu and his consort Śri-Lakṣmī in later vernacular renditions of the tale. As early as the fourteenth century Rāma is praised as the supreme manifestation of the divine,1 and in North India today millions of Hindus consider him and Sītā the supreme divine couple. Throughout this period of divinization, Sītā has achieved her status primarily in relation to Rāma. It is her wifely role, which has come to serve as a paradigm in Hindu mythology, legend, and folktale, which has defined Sītā and made her dear to so many Hindus. Sīta is the perfect model of wifely devotion.

Although Sītā is associated with the wife of Rāma in the minds of all Hindus today, a female divinity named Sītā was known prior to Vālmīki’s *Rāmāyaṇa,* and this deity was associated with agricultural fertility. Just why Vālmīki associated the name of this deity with his heroine is not entirely clear, but that he did so consciously seems beyond doubt.
