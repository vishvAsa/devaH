Rivaling Śrī-Lakṣmī in popularity in the Hindu tradition is the goddess Pārvatī. Unlike Śrī-Lakṣmī, Pārvatī has hardly any independent history of her own. Her identity and nature and nearly all her mythological deeds are defined or acted out vis-à-vis her consort/husband, the great ascetic god Śiva. Since epic times, when Pārvatī first appeared as a significant deity, she has been identified as a reincarnation of the goddess Satī, Śiva’s first wife, who committed suicide because of an insult to her husband. So closely associated is Pārvatī with Satī that the two goddesses are usually treated as one, and their mythologies eventually come to sound very much alike. Both are defined in terms of their courtship and marriage with Śiva, and Pārvatī’s mythology is almost always treated as the ongoing story of Satī.

In classical Hindu mythology the raison d’être of Pārvatī’s \(and Satī’s\) birth is to lure Śiva into marriage and thus into the wider circle of worldly life from which he is aloof as a lone ascetic living in the wilds of the mountains. This goddess \(in both persons, as Satī and Pārvatī\) represents the complementary pole to the ascetic, world-denying pole in the Hindu tradition. In her role as maiden, wife, and later mother \(as Pārvatī\) she extends Śiva’s circle of activity into the realm of the householder, where his stored-up energy is released in positive ways.

As is the case with Lakṣmī, Pārvatī comes to represent certain philosophic absolutes in her association with Śiva. As his *śakti,* or embodied power, she becomes identified with the creative force of the cosmos and the underlying potency of things. Also like Lakṣmī she takes on a paradigmatic role as the ideal wife and mother. In fact, the act of suttee \(Sanskrit *satī*\), in which a Hindu widow immolates herself on her husband’s funeral pyre as a final and consummate act of loyalty and devotion, is patterned on the goddess Satī, from whom the name of the act is derived. In some schools of śaivism Pārvatī also assumes the role of ideal devotee. Finally, in śaiva Siddhānta, a southern school of śaivism, Pārvatī sometimes takes on the role of Śiva’s embodied grace and thus comes to play a role somewhat similar to Śrī-Lakṣmī’s role in Śrī Vaiṣṇavism.
