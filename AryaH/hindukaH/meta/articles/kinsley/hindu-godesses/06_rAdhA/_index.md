Rādhā, like Sītā, is understood primarily in relation to a male consort. Throughout her history Rādhā has been inextricably associated with the god Kṛṣṇa. Unlike Sītā, however, Rādhā’s relationship to Kṛṣṇa is adulterous. Although she is married to another, she is passionately attracted to Kṛṣṇa. Rādhā’s illicit relationship with Kṛṣṇa breaks all social norms and casts her in the role of one who willfully steps outside the realm of dharma to pursue her love. In contrast to Sītā, who is the model of wifely devotion and loyalty, whose foremost concern is the reputation and well-being of her husband, Rādhā invests her whole being in an adulterous affair with the irresistibly beautiful Kṛṣṇa.

This relationship takes place during Kṛṣṇa’s youth or adolescence, before his adult years, when he marries Rukminī, Satyabhāmā, and others, and before his part in the *Mahābhārata* war. Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa’s love affair takes place in the cowherd village of Vraja and in the woods and bowers of Vṛndāvana. In many ways the setting is idyllic, removed from the pragmatic world of social duty, a setting often described as filled with natural beauty, where spring is eternal, and where the vigor and excitement of youth are expressed through Kṛṣṇa’s sports. In most ways Vraja is heaven on earth.1

But all is not blissful fulfillment for Rādhā. Her liaison with Kṛṣṇa is brief, and even at its passionate height Kṛṣṇa arouses Rādhā’s jealousy by consorting with other lovers. The theme of love in separation is a dominant one in their relationship \(particularly from Rādhā’s point of view\) and counterbalances the frenzy and ecstasy of their union.

Rādhā’s popularity develops primarily in the context of devotion to Kṛṣṇa. In religious movements in which devotion to the cowherd god is central, such as the Bengal Vaiṣṇavas and the Vallabhācārins, Rādhā becomes the model of love for the Lord. It is primarily Kṛṣṇa devotees who write poems celebrating the many nuances of Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa’s love; for these devotees Rādhā’s frenzied love for Kṛṣṇa is an emotion and an attitude to be emulated. The love affair of Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa in this devotional context becomes a metaphor for the divine-human relationship. Rādhā represents the human devotee who gives up everything in order to cling to the Lord, and Kṛṣṇa represents God, irresistibly beautiful and attractive. The aim of Kṛṣṇa devotees is to develop or uncover the Rādhā dimension within themselves, that tendency within all human beings to devote themselves entirely and passionately to Kṛṣṇa.
