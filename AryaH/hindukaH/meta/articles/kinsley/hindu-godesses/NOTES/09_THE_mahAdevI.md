1. Some scholars have assumed that an underlying goddess theology asserting the essential unity of all goddesses has existed in Hinduism since the Vedic period. See, for example, Stella Kramrisch, “The Indian Great Goddess,” *History of Religions* 14, no. 4 \(May 1975\): 235-265; J. Przyluski, “The Great Goddess of India and Iran,” *Indian Historical Quarterly* 10 \(1934\): 405-430; and Sadanand K. Dikshit, *The Mother Goddess* \(New Delhi: Published by the author, 1957\). There is little or no evidence for this position, however, and none is adduced by these authors.

2. Thomas B. Coburn, “Consort of None, *Śakti* of All: The Vision of the *Devī-māhātmya,”* in John Stratton Hawley and Donna Marie Wulff, eds., *The Divine Consort: Rādhā and the Goddesses of India* \(Berkeley, Calif.: Berkeley Religious Studies Series, 1982\), pp. 153 ff.

3. For example, the Pāñcarātra school \(Surendranath Dasgupta, *A History of Indian Philosophy,* 5 vols. \[Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1968\], 3:35\); the philosophy of Yāmunācārya \(latter part of the tenth century\), the founder of the Viśiṣṭadvaita school \(ibid., 3:155\); Bengal Vaisnavism \(S. K. De, *Early History of the Vaisnava Faith and Movement in Bengal* \[Calcutta: Firma K. L. Mukhopadhyay, 1961\], pp. 276 ff.\); and Kashmir śaivism \(Sudhen-dukumar Das, *Sakti or Divine Power* \[Calcutta: University of Calcutta, 1934\], p. 61\).

4. For example, Kashmir śaivism; see S. Das, *Sakti,* p. 61.

5. For example, the *Devī-bhāgavata-purāṇa,* where she sits on a couch composed of the great male deities \(7.29.7; 12.12.12\), and the *Saundaryalaharī,* where the same image is described \(verse 94\).

6. This point is dramatically made in the stories about Viṣṇu’s teaching the sage Narada about the nature of his *māyā* when the sage experiences rebirth as a woman. Forgetfulness of one’s past lives, total identification with one’s present life, is exactly what *māyā* is said to be in these tales. See Heinrich Zimmer, *Myths and Symbols of Indian Art and Civilization,* ed. Joseph Campbell \(New York: Harper and Row, 1962\), pp. 30-35.

7. For example, the first episode of the *Devī-māhātmya,* where the Devī is equated with Viṣṇu’s sleep and the deluding power of the world \(1.68-69; 1.40\).

8. For example, *Devī-bhāgavata-purāṇa* 7.33.21-41.

9. For example, ibid. 1.8.40; 3.4.38-39; 3.24.38.

10. Ibid. 3.3.35-67; 12.10-12.

11. For example, *Lalitā-sahasranāma* 281; *Saundaryalaharī* 56; *Sītā-upanisad* 34.

12. For example, *Devī-bhāgavata-purāṇa* 3.5.4; 7.33.13; 12.8.77; *Saundaryalaharī* 53.

13. For example, *Devī-bhāgavata-purāṇa* 7.29.26-30.

14. *Devī-bhāgavata-purāṇa 7.29.7.*

15. Ibid. 5.7.57-60.

16. The Daśamahāvidyās will be discussed in my chapter 11.

17. The Devī’s manifestations are sometimes grouped according to the three *guṇas,* for example, *Devī-purāṇa* 50.5-17. In this case the Dev*ī*’s auspicious forms are grouped under the *sattva* \(and to some extent the *rajas\) guṇa,* and the terrible forms are grouped primarily under the *tamas guṇa.*

22. *The Saundaryalaharī or Flood of Beauty,* ed. and trans. W. Norman Brown \(Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1958\), p. 52, verse 13.

23. For example, *Saundaryalaharī 6.* The Dev*ī* is said in some texts to appear in the form of a great bee or in a form that is surrounded by bees. In this form she is called Bhrāmarīdevī. In Sanskrit erotic literature the bee symbolizes erotic desire, and the Devī’s form as Bhrāmarīdevī may convey this dimension of her character. *Devī-bhāgavata-purāṇa* 10.13; *Devī-māhātmya* 11.50.

24. *Devī-bhāgavata-purāṇa* 7.28; *Devi-māhātmya* 11.45.
