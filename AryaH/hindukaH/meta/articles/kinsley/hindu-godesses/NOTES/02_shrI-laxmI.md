1. Throughout this chapter I have assumed that Śrī and Lakṣmī are the same. It seems clear that in almost every case the names refer to the same goddess. For a discussion of the evidence suggesting their independent identity, see Bandana Saraswati, “The History of the Worship of Srī in North India to cir. A.D. 550” \(Ph.D. diss., University of London, 1971\), pp. 291-296.

3. Although a process of personification seems evident in the origin of the goddess Śrī in Vedic literature, it may be that her origins lie in pre-Vedic Indo-European traditions in which goddesses of royal power are common. It has long been known that the authors of the *Vedas* are Indo-Aryans and therefore related to other Indo-European peoples. As regards the goddess Śrī, it is significant to note that goddesses like her, goddesses associated with royal power and authority, are found in several Indo-European traditions. The Irish goddess Flaith or Flaith Erenn is a good example. See Alf Hiltebeitel, *The Ritual of Battle* \(Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell University Press, 1976\), p. 176.

8. Curt Maury, *Folk Origins of Indian Art* \(New York: Columbia University Press, 1969\), p. 114. Maury interprets the lotus as a symbol of the female sexual organ, which also emphasizes the meaning of the lotus as the source of all life or a symbol of all life \(pp. 110-111\).

24. Maury, *Folk Origins,* p. 105, thinks that Śrī-Lakṣmī’s association with wealth is secondary and subsidiary to her association with vegetation and calls her association with wealth the result of a crass preoccupation with “mundane vanities.” Śrī-Lakṣmī’s association with wealth, however, seems both ancient and consistent with her other qualities.
