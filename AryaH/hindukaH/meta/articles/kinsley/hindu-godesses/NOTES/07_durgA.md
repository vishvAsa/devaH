The most celebrated text describing Durgā’s mythological exploits is the *Devī-māhātmya,* which constitutes chapters 81-93 of the *Mārkandeya-purāṇa.* The myth of Durgā defeating Mahiṣa is also found in the *Vāmana-purāṇa* 19.1-21.52; *Varāha-purāṇa* 62.1-95.65; *Śiva-purāṇa* 5.46.1-63; *Devī-bhāgavata-purāṇa* 5.2-20; *Skanda-purāṇa;* and several *Upa-purāṇas.* The myth concerning Durga’s slaying of Sumbha and Nisumbha is also found in the *Vamana-purāṇa* 29.1-30.73; *Śiva-purāṇa* 5.47.1-48.50; *Skanda-purāṇa* 7.3.24.1-22; and several *Upa-purāṇas.* The worship of Durgā is enjoined and described in the *Kālikā-purāṇa* 61; *Mahābhāgavata-purāṇa* 45-48; and *Devī-purāṇa* 21-23.

10. The term *liminal* has been used by Victor Turner to designate boundary situations, characteristics, and so on. He notes that many rituals purposely seek to involve participants in such situations to allow them to step outside their normal social roles and restraints.

58. Laurence A. Babb, *The Divine Hierarchy: Popular Hinduism in Central India* \(New York: Columbia University Press, 1975\), pp. 216-224, argues that a typical theme in Hindu mythology is the danger presented by unmarried goddesses and females and that unmarried goddesses are generally aggressive and dangerous in their actions. This danger might be presumed to arise from such goddesses’ pent-up sexual energy.

59. This may reflect the male fear of sexual intercourse which sees in the loss of semen something spiritually harmful. An important notion in Indian asceticism is that by retaining this semen a male may build up great spiritual vigor.
