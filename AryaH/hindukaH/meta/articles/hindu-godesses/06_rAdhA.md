Rādhā, like Sītā, is understood primarily in relation to a male consort. Throughout her history Rādhā has been inextricably associated with the god Kṛṣṇa. Unlike Sītā, however, Rādhā’s relationship to Kṛṣṇa is adulterous. Although she is married to another, she is passionately attracted to Kṛṣṇa. Rādhā’s illicit relationship with Kṛṣṇa breaks all social norms and casts her in the role of one who willfully steps outside the realm of dharma to pursue her love. In contrast to Sītā, who is the model of wifely devotion and loyalty, whose foremost concern is the reputation and well-being of her husband, Rādhā invests her whole being in an adulterous affair with the irresistibly beautiful Kṛṣṇa.

This relationship takes place during Kṛṣṇa’s youth or adolescence, before his adult years, when he marries Rukminī, Satyabhāmā, and others, and before his part in the *Mahābhārata* war. Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa’s love affair takes place in the cowherd village of Vraja and in the woods and bowers of Vṛndāvana. In many ways the setting is idyllic, removed from the pragmatic world of social duty, a setting often described as filled with natural beauty, where spring is eternal, and where the vigor and excitement of youth are expressed through Kṛṣṇa’s sports. In most ways Vraja is heaven on earth.1

But all is not blissful fulfillment for Rādhā. Her liaison with Kṛṣṇa is brief, and even at its passionate height Kṛṣṇa arouses Rādhā’s jealousy by consorting with other lovers. The theme of love in separation is a dominant one in their relationship \(particularly from Rādhā’s point of view\) and counterbalances the frenzy and ecstasy of their union.

Rādhā’s popularity develops primarily in the context of devotion to Kṛṣṇa. In religious movements in which devotion to the cowherd god is central, such as the Bengal Vaiṣṇavas and the Vallabhācārins, Rādhā becomes the model of love for the Lord. It is primarily Kṛṣṇa devotees who write poems celebrating the many nuances of Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa’s love; for these devotees Rādhā’s frenzied love for Kṛṣṇa is an emotion and an attitude to be emulated. The love affair of Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa in this devotional context becomes a metaphor for the divine-human relationship. Rādhā represents the human devotee who gives up everything in order to cling to the Lord, and Kṛṣṇa represents God, irresistibly beautiful and attractive. The aim of Kṛṣṇa devotees is to develop or uncover the Rādhā dimension within themselves, that tendency within all human beings to devote themselves entirely and passionately to Kṛṣṇa.

## THE EARLY HISTORY OF RĀDHĀ

Rādhā does not appear as a fully developed figure until quite late in the Hindu tradition. Prior to Jayadeva’s *Gītagovinda* \(twelfth century\) she is mentioned in only a few brief references.2 The *Padma-, Brahmavaivarta-,* and *Devī-bhāgavata-purāṇas,* which describe her affair with Kṛṣṇa in detail, are all considered late. Although the early references are few and although they never supply lengthy descriptions of Rādhā, her character is nevertheless clearly suggested.

In these passages Rādhā is a lovesick girl or woman who is overcome by her emotions. The *Veṇīsaṁhāra* of Bhaṭṭa Nārāyaṇa \(antedates A.D. 800\) describes Rādhā as being angered while making love to Kṛṣṇa and as leaving him while choking on her tears.3 In the *Dhvanyalokālocana* of Abhinavagupta \(early tenth century\) Rādhā weeps pitifully when Kṛṣṇa leaves the village of Vraja for Mathurā, where he begins his adult life.4 She is described in Kṣemendra’s *Daśāvatāracarita* \(1066\) as barely able to speak when Kṛṣṇa leaves for Mathurā.



With tears, flowing away like life in Mādhava’s desertion,

Falling on her breasts’ firm tips, Rādhā was like a laden  
kadamba tree

As tears were strewn by her endless sighing and trembling gait—

Darkened by the delusion that was bound to all her hopes,

She became like the new rainy season engulfed in darkness.5

Although the adulterous aspect of her love is not mentioned explicitly in any of these early references, the centrality of love in separation *\(viraha\)* is clear in almost every one. In later texts it is the illicit nature of Rādhā’s love for Kṛṣṇa that usually necessitates long periods of separation and dictates that she cannot leave with him when he goes away to Mathurā or later to Dv*ā*raka; it is probable that the authors of these earlier passages also understood Rādhā to be married to another man, to be *parakīyā* \(belonging to another\) in her relationship with Kṛṣṇa.

Another characteristic of Rādhā is clear in these early references: she is always associated with Kṛṣṇa. None of the references shows interest in Rādhā per se. It is only her love for Kṛṣṇa, or his love for her, which is mentioned. In several of these texts Kṛṣṇa is as hopelessly impassioned and maddened by love as Rādhā. When he mounts his chariot to leave Vraja he is described in Kṣemendra’s *Daśavātaracarita* as looking longingly for a sight of Rādhā, as being disconsolate, and as sighing unhappily.6 In the *Siddhahemaśabdānuśāna* of Hemacandra \(1088–1172\) we read:



Though Hari sees every person with full regard,

Still his glance goes wherever Rādhā is—

Who can arrest eyes ensnared by love?7

Prior to her appearance as a fully developed heroine in Jayadeva’s *Gītagovinda,* then, Rādhā is known to the Indian literary tradition as a young girl who is passionately in love with Kṛṣṇa; that love is often expressed in terms of separation from him, which suggests an illicit quality to their affair.

## THE GOPĪ TRADITION

Another historical thread is important in understanding Rādhā’s central role in Jayadeva’s writing and in the later devotional movements of North India. This is the mythological tradition surrounding Kṛṣṇa’s sojourn in Vraja and his dalliance there with the *gopīs,* the cowherd women of the village. This tradition dates back to the *Harivaṁśa* \(ca. A.D. 500\) and is a central part of most later Vaiṣṇava *Purānas.* The most popular and detailed rendering of the tradition prior to Jayadeva is found in the *Bhāgavata-purāṇa,* written in South India sometime during the tenth century.8 According to this mythological tradition, Kṛṣṇa’s father spirits him away from Mathurā, where he was born, to escape the threat of his murderous uncle, Kaṁsa. Kṛṣṇa’s father leaves the infant in the home of Nanda and Yaśodā, a cowherd couple, who raise the child as their own in the village of Vraja. On reaching maturity Kṛṣṇa leaves Vraja, returns to Mathurā, and slays Kaṁsa. According to early renditions of this tradition, Kṛṣṇa is an incarnation of Viṣṇu, and the purpose of his incarnation as Kṛṣṇa is to slay Kaṁsa, who is oppressing the earth with his wickedness. The primary focus of the narrative in the *Bhāgavata-purāṇa,* however, and the central interest of the later devotional traditions in North India, is Kṛṣṇa’s sojourn in Vraja, where he sports with his young companions and, on reaching adolescence, dallies with the women of the village.

The village women dote on Kṛṣṇa as a child. They tolerate and are often amused by his pranks. But their interest in him changes to passionate longing when he grows older. They are all married women, but none is able to resist Kṛṣṇa’s beauty and charm. He is described as retiring to the woods, where he plays his flute on autumn nights when the moon is full. Hearing the music, the women are driven mad with passion and give up their domestic roles and chores to dash away to be with Kṛṣṇa in the bowers of Vṛndāvana. They jump up in the middle of putting on their makeup, abandon their families while eating a meal with them, leave food to burn on the stove, and run out of their homes to be with Kṛṣṇa. They are so distraught and frenzied as they rush to his side that their clothes and jewelry come loose and fall off \(10.29.3–7\).

In the woods the *gopīs* sport and play with Kṛṣṇa. They make love in the forest and in the waters of the Jumna River. In some accounts of the tradition Kṛṣṇa is said to multiply himself so that each woman has a Kṛṣṇa to herself. The mood is joyous, festive, and erotic. The text makes no attempt to deny the impropriety of the *gopīs* leaving their husbands and abandoning their social responsibilities in order to make love to Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa even teases some of the women for behaving illicitly \(10.29.26–27\).

No mention is made of Rādhā in any of these early accounts of the *gopī* tradition. The *gopīs,* in fact, are not mentioned by name but are usually treated as a group. In general, Kṛṣṇa is portrayed as sporting with many women at once. The *Bhāgavata-purāṇa* mentions a favorite *gopī.* Kṛṣṇa goes off with her alone, but when she begins to feel proud of herself for being singled out by Kṛṣṇa and asks him to carry her, he disappears, reducing her to tears and remorse \(10.30.35–38\). The lesson seems clear: Kṛṣṇa’s love is not exclusive. He loves all the cowherd women and encourages them all to love him in return.

The role of the cowherd women in the context of devotion is made fairly clear in the *Bhāgavata-purāṇa* itself. The nature of true devotion, the text says, is highly emotional and causes horripilation, tears, loss of control, and frenzy \(11.14.23–24\). Those who love the Lord truly behave like the *gopīs.* They let nothing come between themselves and the Lord. When they hear his call they abandon everything to be with him. Even though they are married and have household duties to attend to, even though they incur the censure of society, they rush off to be with Kṛṣṇa when they hear his call. So too should the ardent devotee behave in loving Kṛṣṇa. In their disregard for normal social roles, in their extreme emotion and frenzy, the *gopīs* serve as an appropriate metaphor for the divine-human love affair. Rādhā, as we shall see, inherits this role in the later devotional movements, particularly in Bengal.

## RĀDHĀ AS BELONGING TO ANOTHER \(PARAKĪYĀ\)

Not until Jayadeva’s *Gītagovinda* in the twelfth century do we find a sustained rendition of Rādhā as the central figure in the love drama between Kṛṣṇa and the cowherd women of Vraja. In this poem the tradition of Rādhā as Kṛṣṇa’s favorite and the tradition of the *gopīs* came together to form the central heroine of the text. The poem is dominated by the lovesick Rādhā, who ventures out at night to search the woods for her lover, Kṛṣṇa. Several familiar allusions to Vraja and to Kṛṣṇa’s foster parents make it clear that the context of the drama is set in the cowherd village described in the earlier *gopī* tradition. The whole flavor of the poem, however, lacks the festive, joyful, carnival-like atmosphere of earlier descriptions of Kṛṣṇa’s love play with the cowherd women. The *Gītagovinda* is written almost entirely from Rādhā’s point of view, and the dominant emotion is love in separation *\(viraha\).*

The texts in the *gopī* tradition prior to Jayadeva focused primarily on the external characteristics of the women’s attachment to Kṛṣṇa. Frenzy, horripilation, frantic haste, and shuddering characterize the *gopīs* when they hear Kṛṣṇa’s flute and dally with him in the woods. With Rādhā the focus changes to the internal, shifting moods of a specific woman. Whereas the early *gopī* tradition concentrated on exterior landscapes, painting lush pictures of Kṛṣṇa’s dalliance with hundreds of smitten women in the woods of Vṛndāvana, the *Gītagovinda* through the heroine Rādhā explores interior landscapes and paints moody pictures of obsessive love. Almost the entire *Gītagovinda* deals with Rādhā separated from and searching for Kṛṣṇa. She experiences longing, jealousy, and sorrow. The overall mood is not that of joyful union, although the two do unite blissfully at the end of the poem, but of love in separation, which causes Rādhā pain. In the flowering bowers of Vṛndāvana, amid the joyful celebration of spring throughout the natural world, Rādhā is tormented by her love.



When spring came, tender-limbed Rādhā wandered

Like a flowering creeper in the forest wilderness,

Seeking Krishna in his many haunts.

The god of love increased her ordeal,

Tormenting her with fevered thoughts,

And her friend sang to heighten the mood.9

Although Rādhā’s marital status is not specified in the *Gītagovinda,,* there are hints that she belongs to another man.10 The whole drama takes place at night in the woods and is surrounded by secrecy. It is not a relationship that takes place under the approving eye of society. Whether or not Rādhā is married to another man, Kṛṣṇa certainly is not married to her and consorts with other women, which makes Rādhā jealous. The whole mood suggests that Rādhā’s love for Kṛṣṇa is illicit, that she has no formal claim on him, and that in order to be with him she must risk the dangers of the night, the woods, and public censure.

Rādhā’s illicit love for Kṛṣṇa is the central theme in the poetry of Vidyāpati \(1352–1448\) and Caṇḍīdās \(ca. fourteenth to fifteenth century\). Both authors make it clear that she is married to another man and that she risks social ostracism by pursuing her affair with Kṛṣṇa. Vidyāpati describes Rādhā as a woman of noble family, but he portrays Kṛṣṇa as a common villager. In loving Kṛṣṇa Rādhā sacrifices her status and reputation.



I who body and soul

am at your beck and call,

was a girl of noble family.

I took no thought for what would be said of me,

I abandoned everything.11

Many poems portray Rādhā as torn between seeking out Kṛṣṇa and protecting her reputation. Her love for him totally possesses her but is extremely dangerous to reveal. The matter is put succinctly by Rādhā at one point: “If I go \[to Kṛṣṇa\] I lose my home / If I stay I lose my love.”12 As always happens when Rādhā is so torn, she decides in favor of going to Kṛṣṇa, in this case despite a full moon that lights up the village and forest so that she fears she will be discovered.

The theme of Rādhā’s abandoning her social duty to love Kṛṣṇa is central in the poems of Caṇḍīdās. Caṇḍīdās describes Rādhā as a forthright, strong-willed woman who, although married to a man named Āyāna, does not hesitate to incur the wrath of her family and village to be with Kṛṣṇa. In Caṇḍīdas’s poems Rādhā is not secretive about her illicit love, although the dire social consequences of her adultery are mentioned repeatedly. Realizing that it will entail social censure, she knowingly and willfully makes a choice to love Kṛṣṇa; having made that choice she is not inclined to keep her adultery a secret.

Casting away

All ethics of caste

My heart dotes on Krishna

Day and night.

The custom of the clan

Is a far-away cry

And now I know

That love adheres wholly

To its own laws.13

Rādhā is rebellious in her attitude, cursing her fate and the society that would keep her married to her husband, whom she describes as a dolt, and away from Kṛṣṇa. Impatient and angry with her painful situation, she threatens to burn down her house, which represents a social identity and destiny that would keep her away from her beloved.



I throw ashes at all laws

Made by man or god.

I am born alone,

With no companion.

What is the worth

Of your vile laws

That failed me

In love,

And left me with a fool,

A dumbskull \[Āyāna\]?



My wretched fate

Is so designed

That he is absent

For whom I long.

I will set fire to this house

And go away.14

In the sixteenth century a devotional movement centered on the worship of Kṛṣṇa arose in Bengal. At the center of this movement was Caitanya \(1486–1533\), who in his own devotion to Kṛṣṇa imitated the emotional traumas of the lovesick Rādhā. In the subsequent history of the movement Rādhā continued to play a central role as the devotee par excellence of Kṛṣṇa. According to the theologians of the movement, a devotee may approach the Lord in a variety of moods or modes: the contemplative mood, in which the Lord is approached as transcendent; the mood of the servant, in which the Lord is approached as a master; the mood of a friend; the mood of a parent; and the mood of the lover. Furthermore, the theologians have ranked these moods. The least worthy modes of approach to Kṛṣṇa emphasize his transcendent qualities of lordship; the most worthy modes maximize the intimacy between the devotee and Kṛṣṇa. The mood of the lover is affirmed to be the best approach, the mood most cherished by the Lord himself, and of all lovers of the Lord Rādhā is affirmed to be Kṛṣṇa’s favorite. Throughout the poetry, literature, and devotion of the movement, Rādhā plays a central role. Her *parakīyā* \(belonging to another man\) status vis-à-vis Kṛṣṇa is also maintained in the mythology, worship, and theology of the Bengal Vaiṣṇavas.

What seems clear is that the Bengal Vaiṣṇavas and other devotional movements that center on Kṛṣṇa devotion, such as the Vallabhācārins,15 understand quite well that the adulterous nature of Rādhā’s love for Kṛṣṇa is appropriate as a devotional metaphor. In fact, the superiority of illicit love is argued by the Bengal Vaiṣṇava theologians in some detail. Their main point is that illicit love is given freely, makes no legal claims, and as such is selfless. Married love, they argue, functions according to rights and obligations in which both partners have specific expectations of each other, including sexual gratification. Married love, it is argued, is characterized by *kāma* \(sexual lust\), while Rādhā’s love, illicit and adulterous though it may be, is characterized by *prema* \(selfless love for the beloved\).16 And selfless love is what Kṛṣṇa desires.

The illicit nature of Rādhā’s love is deemed appropriate for other reasons as well. Because of the adulterous nature of her love, Rādhā must overcome many obstacles in order to satisfy her love. The impediments put in her way serve to increase that love. The long periods of separation, far from cooling her emotions, serve to enhance her feelings. Married love, in contrast, operates without any obstacles or impediments. There is very little separation, and it can become routine and boring. Rādhā’s love for Kṛṣṇa is full of risk, insecurity, painful separation, and hence periodic thrills of union. As a metaphor of the divine-human relationship, the illicit nature of Rādhā’s love is held to be superior to any example of married love. The devotional attitude held in highest esteem by the Bengal Vaiṣṇavas is characterized by uncontrolled frenzy, weeping, and ecstatic feelings. The Lord’s presence is held to be surpassingly beautiful and irresistible and its effect on the devotee devastating. The devotee, however, in responding to the Lord’s presence, can never count on binding the Lord through love. Kṛṣṇa is always free to come and go, and the devotee often spends long periods in painful separation from Kṛṣṇa. These feelings and experiences, seen as rare in married love, are epitomized in Rādhā’s adulterous love.

It is probably not surprising that some Bengal Vaiṣṇavas were tempted to argue that Rādhā was *svakīyā* \(married to Kṛṣṇa\) in her affair with Kṛṣṇa. An adulterous sexual affair at the center of their devotional mythology was understandably embarrassing to some devotees. The illicit nature of Rādhā’s love, however, her *parakīyā* status, eventually came to be declared the orthodox position. The issue was even the subject of a formal debate in 1717. The proponents of the *parakīyā* position were declared the winners.17

Given Rādhā’s central position in Bengal Vaiṣṇavism it is understandable that she herself tended to become an object of devotion and the subject of metaphysical speculation in the writings of the movement. The sixteenth-century dramas of Rūpa Gosvāmin, the leading theologian of the movement, cast Rādhā in the familiar role as the foremost lover of the Lord, the paradigm of complete devotion. Her mind is totally obsessed with Kṛṣṇa to the point that, in pique, she tries in vain to forget him. Her utter preoccupation with him is contrasted to those mere fleeting glimpses that sages and ascetics attain of the Lord after arduous meditation and spiritual exercises.



Seeking to meditate for a moment upon Krishna,

The sage wrests his mind from the objects of sense;

This child \[Rādhā\] draws her mind away from Him

To fix it on mere worldly things.

The *yogī* yearns for a tiny flash of Krishna in his heart;

Look—this foolish girl strives to banish Him from hers\!18

Rādhā has also achieved the position of receiving devotion herself in these plays. The most sustained example in Rūpa’s plays is the devotion of Kṛṣṇa himself to Rādhā. He is often pictured doting on Rādhā, concentrating his mind on her with the single-minded attention of a yogi and losing sleep because of her.19 Just as Rādhā in her total preoccupation with Kṛṣṇa sees him everywhere, so Kṛṣṇa is similarly entranced and sees Rādhā everywhere. “Radha appears before me on every side; how is it that for me the three worlds have become Rādhā?”20 And just as Rādhā makes gestures of adoration toward Kṛṣṇa in the dramas, so too Kṛṣṇa makes worshipful gestures to Rādhā, which indicate to the audience Rādhā’s status as a being worthy of reverence.

Other characters in the plays also revere Rādhā. The elderly go-between, Paurṇamasī, Rādhā’s two female friends, Lalitā and Viśākhā, and Kṛṣṇa’s foster mother, Yaśodā, all admire and dote on Rādhā in various moods that are held appropriate for devotion to Kṛṣṇa.21 In many cases Rādhā’s own emotions toward Kṛṣṇa are echoed in the emotions of Rādhā’s friends toward her. Lalitā, for example, cries in grief at the thought of Rādhā’s leaving, just as Rādhā grieves at the thought of Kṛṣṇa’s leaving.22 Rūpa’s aim in the drama seems clear: he is portraying Rādhā as worthy of devotion by Kṛṣṇa devotees. In doing this, however, he is not detracting from the centrality of Kṛṣṇa himself, who throughout the dramas is the object of Rādhā’s passion.

Rādhā’s status as a being worthy of worship by Kṛṣṇa devotees is explained in the philosophic teachings of the Bengal Vaiṣṇavas. Kṛṣṇa, the ultimate godhead, includes within himself various *śaktis,* powers through which he reveals and displays himself. For example, by means of certain *śaktis* he creates the world. His essential nature, however, is displayed through his *svarūpa śakti* \(own form\). Within this *svarūpa śakti* are contained other *śaktis,* the most essential of which is the *hlādinī śakti,* the *śakti* of bliss. This *sakti* is understood to be the most refined essence of the godhead, Kṛṣṇa in his most sublime and complete form. And this *hlādinī śakti* is identified with none other than Rādhā herself.23

If Rādhā is Kṛṣṇa, if Kṛṣṇa is Rādhā—which is the import of this theological doctrine—then Rādhā is essentially divine and as such worthy of the devotee’s adoration. From the point of view of the devotee, Rādhā’s centrality to devotion is not limited to her role as a model to be imitated or an ideal to be pursued. She herself may now be doted on with efficacious results, as she herself is part of, indeed, is the essence of, the godhead. In this theological vision Rādhā has assumed the position of Kṛṣṇa’s eternal *śakti.* Her role as the ideal human devotee is necessarily played down as her divine status as Kṛṣṇa’s *śakti* is emphasized. On the model of other divine couples—Śiva-Pārvatī, Rāma-Sītā, Viṣṇu-Lakṣmī—Rādhā assumes the position of a heavenly deity whom the devotee supplicates.

Another significant implication of this theological vision is that Rādhā is no longer necessarily seen as *parakīyā* to Kṛṣṇa. Although their dalliances may be described as illicit, although Rādhā is said to be married to another man, ultimately she is an aspect of Kṛṣṇa’s own being and thus really belongs to him. His sport with her is an eternal self-dalliance by which or in which he is enabled to appreciate his own paramount beauty.24

Although the theology of the Bengal Vaiṣṇavas provides an avenue for reinterpreting Rādhā as belonging to Kṛṣṇa and not to another man, the movement steadfastly resisted playing down the illicit, adulterous dimension of Rādhā’s love for Kṛṣṇa and even declared the *parakīyā* position the orthodox doctrine. From the devotional point of view, Rādhā’s love for Kṛṣṇa would lose some of its intensity, fervor, and passion if she were understood to be married to him. To this day, among Kṛṣṇa devotees for whom the mode of the lover is the most sublime approach to Kṛṣṇa, it is understood that Rādhā’s love for Kṛṣṇa, which is always described as selfless love *\(prema\),* expresses itself without any formal obligation or legal duty on her part. Her love is spontaneous and complete. In her relationship with Kṛṣṇa she gains nothing \(from the worldly point of view\), losing her reputation, pride of family, and so on. She clearly goes against the ways of the world to express her emotions. It is as an adulteress that these dimensions of her love are best expressed. Rādhā loves Kṛṣṇa *in spite* of everything, not because she has an obligation to him.

## RĀDHĀ AS BELONGING TO KṚṢṆA \(SVAKĪYĀ\)

Although Rādhā’s position as Kṛṣṇa’s legal, divine consort never became very popular in Kṛṣṇa devotional movements, there is a sustained rendition of Kṛṣṇa mythology in which Rādhā is cast in this role. The *Brahma-vaivarta-purāṇa* assumes Rādhā’s status as a goddess.25 She is inextricably associated with Kṛṣṇa philosophically as his *śakti,* as his underlying power or that dimension of himself that empowers him, indeed, enables him, to create the world and display himself in his various forms. Several passages compare Rādhā to Kṛṣṇa in such a way that her status is affirmed to be comparable, equal, or even superior to his own. For example, a familiar analogy likens Rādhā to the clay with which Kṛṣṇa, the potter, creates the world.26 She is identified with *prakṛti,* the primordial matter or substance of creation; Kṛṣṇa is identified with *puruṣa,* the spiritual essence of reality that stirs *prakṛti* to evolve into various forms. Elsewhere the two are identified on the analogy of attribute and substance. Kṛṣṇa says to Rādhā:



As you are, so am I; there is certainly no difference  
between us.

As whiteness inheres in milk, as burning in fire,  
my fair Lady,

As smell in earth, so do I inhere in you always.27

Another passage describes the two as initially forming an androgynous figure, of which Kṛṣṇa is one half and Rādhā the other. Rādhā says to Kṛṣṇa:



I have been constructed by someone out of half your body;

Therefore there is no difference between us, and my  
heart is in you.

Just as my Self \(Ātman\), heart, and life has been placed  
in you,

So has your Self, heart, and life been placed in me.28

The text elevates Rādhā to such an extent that in several places it states that she is superior in status to Kṛṣṇa himself. In one passage, for example, Kṛṣṇa is speaking to Rādhā and says that all things in the universe have some kind of support, that without some kind of support they could not exist. His support, he concludes, is Rādhā, upon whom he rests eternally.29 She alone, by implication, has no support and as such is the supreme reality. In another place Kṛṣṇa likens Rādhā to his *ātman:* “You are my life; I am dead without you.”30 In another passage Rādhā is called mother of the world and Kṛṣṇa father of the world. The mother, however, is declared to be the guru of the father and as such is said to be worshiped as supreme.31

Rādhā’s elevated status, her role as cosmic queen equal to or superior to Kṛṣṇa, gives her a central role in the cosmogony in the *Brahma-vaivarta-purāṇa.* In one version of creation Kṛṣṇa desires to create and so divides himself into two, male and female. The two undertake sexual intercourse for a long time, during which his sighs and the sweat from her body create the winds and primordial oceans. Eventually he ejaculates into her; after bearing his seed for many years, she gives birth to a golden egg, the universe itself. The egg floats in the cosmic waters for a long time, then splits, and the god Viṣṇu is born; he in turn creates innumerable worlds.32 As creator of the universe we find Rādhā playing a role that is extremely atypical of her earlier history, namely, the role of mother. Nowhere in earlier literature is Rādhā a mother. In the *Brahma-vaivarta-purāṇa,* however, she is often called by names that suggest her motherly role vis-à-vis the created world. She is called mother of Visnu \(Mahāviṣṇormātṛ, Mahāviṣṇudhātrī\), mother of the world \(Jaganmātr, Jagadambikā\), and mother of all \(Sarvamātr\).33

Rādhā’s personal relationship to Kṛṣṇa has also undergone significant changes in this text. In earlier literature her relationship to him was consistently described as nonpossessive and was characterized by love in separation. These qualities stemmed in good measure from the illicit nature of their love, in which neither could exert legal or formal controls over the other. As a woman married to another man, Rādhā owed Kṛṣṇa nothing. In the *Brahma-vaivarta-purāṇa,* however, in which the two are understood to be eternally related to each other as husband and wife \(or as god and goddess\), Rādhā’s love takes on a possessive quality. As the queen of the cosmos, as consort of the great god Kṛṣṇa, she is described as surrounded and worshiped by millions of cowherd devotees and as acting the part of the chaste and jealous wife of Kṛṣṇa. At several points in the text Rādhā discovers Kṛṣṇa dallying with other women. Her reaction is always the same: she is outraged, jealous, and vengeful. She terrifies Kṛṣṇa in her rage and curses her rivals to miserable fates. In one case a woman named Virājā is so scared of Rādhā’s wrath that she commits suicide.34 Rādhā’s love is described in many episodes as cruel, selfish, and demanding. In several cases she nags Kṛṣṇa about which consort he loves best and is only contented when he flatters her.35 In contrast to earlier descriptions of her love for Kṛṣṇa, in the *Brahma-vaivarta-purāṇa* she is a selfish, vindictive, and insecure wife who makes life miserable for Kṛṣṇa, herself, and the other women of heavenly Vraja. If Rādhā has gained metaphysical promotion in the *Brahma-vaivarta-purāṇa,* it seems to have been at the expense of losing her intrinsic appeal as the lovesick girl of Vraja, who is unable to make any claims on her lover. The Rādhā of the *Brahma-vaivarta-purana* has lost her innocence, her intensity, and a considerable part of her charm.

Nevertheless, although most Kṛṣṇa devotional movements rejected this portrait of Rādhā as *svakīyā* \(the text is undoubtedly quite late, dating from the fifteenth or sixteenth century\), a few small groups revere Rādhā in her role as cosmic queen. Both the Rādhāvallabhins and the Sakhībhavas, movements that arose sometime during the sixteenth century in and around Brindaban in North India, place Rādhā in a position similar to her position in the *Brahma-vaivarta-purāṇa.* The Rādhāvallabhins in their actual devotion concentrate on Rādhā more than on Kṛṣṇa. The Sakhībhavas express their piety by concentrating on becoming servants or friends of Rādhā. In their rituals they dress like women and express their devotion by doting on Rādhā and serving her in every way. The attitude of these movements is nicely expressed in the words of one of their members: “Krishna is the servant of Rādhā. He may do the coolie-work of building the world, but Rādhā sits as Queen. He is at best but her Secretary of State. We win the favor of Krishna by worshipping Rādhā.”36
