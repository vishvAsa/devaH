title = "01 EARTH AS A GODDESS/INDIA AS A GODDESS"

+++

An important aspect of the reverence for the divine feminine in the Hindu tradition is an awe for the sacrality of the land itself and for the Indian subcontinent as a whole. The most ancient expression of this in the Hindu tradition is found in the *Ṛg-veda* and its several hymns that praise the goddess Pṛthivī. It is clear that the hymns to Pṛthivī are grounded in reverence for the awesome stability of the earth itself and the apparently inexhaustible fecundity possessed by the earth.1 When Pṛthivī is described, characterized, or otherwise praised, the earth itself is usually the object of the hymn. Pṛthivī is the earth in a literal sense as much as she is a goddess with anthropomorphic characteristics.

An underlying implication of perceiving the earth as a great and powerful goddess is that the world as a whole, the cosmos itself, is to be understood as a great, living being, a cosmic organism. This idea is expressed in the central creation myth of the *Brāhmaṇas*, which feature the deity Prajāpati. The world was created, according to this scenario, when Prajāpati undertook great austerities and subsequently released his immense stored-up energy.2 This great vigor became the underlying substance of the world, pervading it with life and energy. The aim of Vedic sacrificial ritual in the context of this myth is to reconstitute, replenish, rebuild, or reinvigorate Prajāpati by gathering his dispersed energy. By gathering, nurturing, and feeding Agni \(who is identified with Prajāpati’s released power\), the participants in these rites understand that they are renewing Prajāpati. Vedic rituals therefore become part of an ongoing cycle in which Prajāpati creatively releases his ascetic power3 into the world and is then continually renourished in the sacrificial cult.4

The idea of the earth as a personified goddess and the idea that the cosmos as a whole is a living being persist and are central in later Hindu mythology. Pṛthivī continues to be mentioned in medieval mythological texts, and reverence for Bhūdevī \(whose name literally means “the goddess who is the earth”\) becomes an important aspect of Vaiṣṇavite mythology and iconography. When Bhūdevī complains that she is being oppressed by a certain demon, Viṣṇu, attentive to the welfare of the earth, assumes the appropriate form and rescues the earth from her predicament.5 Iconographically it is common to see Viṣṇu flanked by Śrl-Lakṣmī on one side and Bhūdevī on the other.6 Bhūdevī’s primary role in medieval mythology, however, does not seem to be as the underlying, stable, broad ground that supports all creatures or as the source of inexhaustible fertility. These aspects of the earth, expressed in early hymns to Pṛthivī, are found in other goddesses, such as śākambharī, Lakṣmī, and the Mahādevī.7 Bhūdevī’s primary role is that of an injured supplicant who is being oppressed by wicked rulers.8

Texts extolling the Mahādevī contain many examples of her identification with the world or the cosmos. The Mahādevī is often identified with *prakṛti*, primordial matter or nature \(see chapter 9 above\).9 The stuff of creation, the basic matter of the world, is affirmed to be a divine being. In the *Devī-māhātmya* the world is said to be filled by her \(11.5\); she is said to constitute every created thing \(11.6\). In the *Devī-bhāgavata-purāṇa* she is said to be present everywhere in the universe, from Brahmā to each blade of grass \(1.9.31–32\). The Devī herself proclaims to Viṣṇu that everything that is seen is she \(1.15.52\). At the time of the dissolution the Devī is said to withdraw the world into her womb and then to exist as the seed of the universe until the next creation, when she grows and blossoms forth \(3.3.54–55\). She is said to appear in the form of the universe. As a spider weaves its web, the Devī creates the universe out of her own body \(3.4.41; 4.19.10\). In the *Lalitā-sahasranāma* she is called she whose form is all \(Sarvamayī, 203\), she whose body is matter \(Kṣetrasvarūpā, 341\), she who is the world \(Jadātmikā, 419\), she whose womb contains the universe \(Viśvagarbhā, 637\), and she whose form is all existing things \(Bhūmarūpā, 666\). She is also called Mahī \(718\) and Dharā \(955\), two common names for the earth.

The identification of the Devī with matter, the earth, or the cosmos is often expressed by identifying parts of the world with parts of her body. The *Devī-bhāgavata-purāṇa* calls the earth the Devī’s loins \(5.8.72\). The same text speaks of the oceans as her bowels, the mountains as her bones, the rivers as her veins, and the trees as her body hair. The sun and moon are her eyes, and the nether worlds are said to be her hips, legs, and feet \(7.33.21–41\).10 Somadeva’s *Yaśastilaka* describes the goddess Aparājītā as having the stars for pearls in her hair, the sun and moon for eyes, the heavenly rivers as her girdle, and Mount Meru as her body.11 In a Gupta inscription Kumarāgupta is said to rule over the whole earth, whose “marriage-string is the verge of the four oceans; whose large breasts are \(the mountains\) Sumeru and Kailāsa; \[and\] whose laughter is the full-blown flowers showered forth from the borders of the woods.”12

The image of the earth, or at least of India, as a great goddess in the Gupta inscription is part of a Gupta ideology that was inspired to a great extent by Vaiṣṇava mythology and theology. The Gupta rulers saw themselves as divine instruments of Viṣṇu, the cosmic king. Like Viṣṇu they understood themselves as protecting the earth and cosmic stability in general. The boar *avatāra* of Viṣṇu, who rescues the earth by diving into the primordial waters where she has been taken by a demon and raising her up on his tusk,13 was particularly popular among the Guptas and probably represented a mythological model that expressed their understanding of their political role.14

The fundamental conviction that the earth itself, or the Indian subcontinent itself, is a goddess, indeed, that she is one’s mother, pervades the modern cult of Bhārat Mātā \(Mother India\), in which all Indians are called sons or children of India and are expected to protect their mother without regard for personal hardship and sacrifice. One of the earliest and probably still the most popular literary expressions of this theme is Bankim Chandra Chatterjee’s novel *Ānandamath*, written in the late nineteenth century when the Indian independence movement was beginning to become powerful. The novel is set in Bengal in the late eighteenth century during a great famine. The action centers around a conflict between a band of militant Hindu ascetics and the Muslim rulers of Bengal \(and eventually their British allies\). The ascetics have renounced wealth, prestige, and even their families to devote themselves to the service and freedom of their motherland, Bengal. They are worshipers of Viṣṇu’s man-lion *avatāra*, a particularly ferocious aspect of the divine, while at the same time being devoted to the mother, who is worshiped in concrete form in images of Durgā and Kālī.15 In the context of the novel it is clear that it is not Durgā herself, or Kālī herself, who is the object of reverence on the part of the ascetics \(and the author\). Kālī’s image is interpreted as the present condition of the mother; that is, the mother, under the domination of foreigners, has become naked, poor, and disheveled. Mahendra, the hero of the work, is told as he gazes on her image that the severed arms that adorn her waist as a girdle are the arms of devotees who will have to be sacrificed before the mother can be freed from her foreign yoke.16 For purposes of the novel, Kālī’s appearance—naked, disheveled, and in disarray—becomes a symbol of the present condition of the motherland: a place of sickness, death, poverty, and exploitation.

The band of ascetics are known as the children, and their battle cry is “hail to the mother” \(*bande mātāram*\). All of the children have vowed to serve the mother and have sworn not to return to their families until she is saved.17 When the hero, Mahendra, asks who this mother is, he receives this explicit answer from one of the leaders of the children: “ ‘We own no other mother,’ retorted Bhavānanda; ‘they say, “the mother and the land of birth are higher than heaven.” We think the land of birth to be no other than our mother herself. We have no mother, no father, no brother, no wife, no child, no hearth or home, we have only got the mother.’ “18

Bhavānanda elaborates his answer to Mahendra’s question by singing a hymn in praise of the mother, which is clearly a hymn of praise to the motherland. This hymn became known as the “Bande Mātāram” and was very popular during the independence movement in India.



Hail thee mother\! To thee I bow\!

Who with sweetest water o’erflows

With dainty fruits is rich and endowed

And cooling whom the south wind blows;

Who’s green with crops as on her grow;

To such a mother down I bow\!



With silver moon beams smile her nights

And trees that in her bloom abound

Adorn her; and her face doth beam

With sweetest smiles, sweet’s her sound\!

Joy and bliss she doth bestow;

To such a mother down I bow.



Resounding with triumphal shouts

from seventy million voices bold

With devotion served by twice

As many hands that ably hold

The sharp and shining rapier bold,

—Thou a weakling we are told\!



Proud in strength and prowess thou art,

Redeemer of thy children thou;

Chastiser of aggressive foes;

Mother, to thee thy child I bow.



Thou are knowledge, thou my faith,

Thou my heart and thou my mind.

Nay more, thou art the vital air

That moves my body from behind.

Of my hands thou are the strength,

At my heart devotion thou,

In each temple and each shrine,

To thy image it is we bow.



Durga bold who wields her arms

With half a score of hands,

The science-goddess, Vani too,

And Lakshmi who on lotus stands,—

What are they but, mother, thou,

To thee in all these forms I bow\!



To thee\! Fortune-giver, that art

To fault unknown, beyond compare,

Who dost with sweetest waters flow

And on thy children in thy care

Dainty fruits dost rich bestow,

To thee, mother, to thee I bow\!



To thee I bow, that art so green

And so rich bedecked; with smile

Thy face doth glow; thou dost sustain

And hold us—still unknown to guile\!

Hail thee mother\! To thee I bow\!19

Independent India still cultivates this theme of the motherland as a goddess. The Indian national anthem, composed by Rabindranath Tagore and first sung in 1911 at the Indian National Congress in Calcutta, is in the same vein as Chatterjee’s “Bande Mātāram.”



Thou art the ruler of the minds of all people,

Dispenser of India’s destiny.

Thy name rouses the hearts of Punjab, Sind, Gujarat and Maratha,

Of Dravida and Orissa and Bengal.

It echoes in the hills of Vindhyas and Himalayas, mingles in the music of Jamuna and Ganges and is chanted by the waves of the Indian Sea.

They pray for thy blessings and sing thy praise.

The saving of all people waits in thy hand,

Thou dispenser of India’s destiny.

Victory, victory, victory to thee.20

Concrete expressions of this reverence for India as a feminine deity are not difficult to find in modern India. In Banaras, the spiritual capital of Hinduism, there is a temple dedicated to Bhārat Mātā. Inside the temple, in the place where there would ordinarily be an anthropomorphic image of the goddess, there is a large, colored relief map of the Indian subcontinent. It is to this large map that pilgrims show reverence.21 Insofar as the nation-state represents, is identified with, or is associated with the land itself, it is due reverence. For the land itself is a sacred, nourishing, redemptive presence to those who are born from it and are nourished by it.
