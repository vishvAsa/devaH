## EARTH AS A GODDESS/INDIA AS A GODDESS

An important aspect of the reverence for the divine feminine in the Hindu tradition is an awe for the sacrality of the land itself and for the Indian subcontinent as a whole. The most ancient expression of this in the Hindu tradition is found in the *Ṛg-veda* and its several hymns that praise the goddess Pṛthivī. It is clear that the hymns to Pṛthivī are grounded in reverence for the awesome stability of the earth itself and the apparently inexhaustible fecundity possessed by the earth.1 When Pṛthivī is described, characterized, or otherwise praised, the earth itself is usually the object of the hymn. Pṛthivī is the earth in a literal sense as much as she is a goddess with anthropomorphic characteristics.

An underlying implication of perceiving the earth as a great and powerful goddess is that the world as a whole, the cosmos itself, is to be understood as a great, living being, a cosmic organism. This idea is expressed in the central creation myth of the *Brāhmaṇas*, which feature the deity Prajāpati. The world was created, according to this scenario, when Prajāpati undertook great austerities and subsequently released his immense stored-up energy.2 This great vigor became the underlying substance of the world, pervading it with life and energy. The aim of Vedic sacrificial ritual in the context of this myth is to reconstitute, replenish, rebuild, or reinvigorate Prajāpati by gathering his dispersed energy. By gathering, nurturing, and feeding Agni \(who is identified with Prajāpati’s released power\), the participants in these rites understand that they are renewing Prajāpati. Vedic rituals therefore become part of an ongoing cycle in which Prajāpati creatively releases his ascetic power3 into the world and is then continually renourished in the sacrificial cult.4

The idea of the earth as a personified goddess and the idea that the cosmos as a whole is a living being persist and are central in later Hindu mythology. Pṛthivī continues to be mentioned in medieval mythological texts, and reverence for Bhūdevī \(whose name literally means “the goddess who is the earth”\) becomes an important aspect of Vaiṣṇavite mythology and iconography. When Bhūdevī complains that she is being oppressed by a certain demon, Viṣṇu, attentive to the welfare of the earth, assumes the appropriate form and rescues the earth from her predicament.5 Iconographically it is common to see Viṣṇu flanked by Śrl-Lakṣmī on one side and Bhūdevī on the other.6 Bhūdevī’s primary role in medieval mythology, however, does not seem to be as the underlying, stable, broad ground that supports all creatures or as the source of inexhaustible fertility. These aspects of the earth, expressed in early hymns to Pṛthivī, are found in other goddesses, such as śākambharī, Lakṣmī, and the Mahādevī.7 Bhūdevī’s primary role is that of an injured supplicant who is being oppressed by wicked rulers.8

Texts extolling the Mahādevī contain many examples of her identification with the world or the cosmos. The Mahādevī is often identified with *prakṛti*, primordial matter or nature \(see chapter 9 above\).9 The stuff of creation, the basic matter of the world, is affirmed to be a divine being. In the *Devī-māhātmya* the world is said to be filled by her \(11.5\); she is said to constitute every created thing \(11.6\). In the *Devī-bhāgavata-purāṇa* she is said to be present everywhere in the universe, from Brahmā to each blade of grass \(1.9.31–32\). The Devī herself proclaims to Viṣṇu that everything that is seen is she \(1.15.52\). At the time of the dissolution the Devī is said to withdraw the world into her womb and then to exist as the seed of the universe until the next creation, when she grows and blossoms forth \(3.3.54–55\). She is said to appear in the form of the universe. As a spider weaves its web, the Devī creates the universe out of her own body \(3.4.41; 4.19.10\). In the *Lalitā-sahasranāma* she is called she whose form is all \(Sarvamayī, 203\), she whose body is matter \(Kṣetrasvarūpā, 341\), she who is the world \(Jadātmikā, 419\), she whose womb contains the universe \(Viśvagarbhā, 637\), and she whose form is all existing things \(Bhūmarūpā, 666\). She is also called Mahī \(718\) and Dharā \(955\), two common names for the earth.

The identification of the Devī with matter, the earth, or the cosmos is often expressed by identifying parts of the world with parts of her body. The *Devī-bhāgavata-purāṇa* calls the earth the Devī’s loins \(5.8.72\). The same text speaks of the oceans as her bowels, the mountains as her bones, the rivers as her veins, and the trees as her body hair. The sun and moon are her eyes, and the nether worlds are said to be her hips, legs, and feet \(7.33.21–41\).10 Somadeva’s *Yaśastilaka* describes the goddess Aparājītā as having the stars for pearls in her hair, the sun and moon for eyes, the heavenly rivers as her girdle, and Mount Meru as her body.11 In a Gupta inscription Kumarāgupta is said to rule over the whole earth, whose “marriage-string is the verge of the four oceans; whose large breasts are \(the mountains\) Sumeru and Kailāsa; \[and\] whose laughter is the full-blown flowers showered forth from the borders of the woods.”12



The goddess Earth. Nineteenth century A.D. National Museum, Bankok. Mario Bussagli and Calembus Sivaramamurti, *5000 Years of the Art of India* \(New York: Harry Abrams, 1981\), fig. 211, p. 185. Reprinted by permission of the publisher.

The image of the earth, or at least of India, as a great goddess in the Gupta inscription is part of a Gupta ideology that was inspired to a great extent by Vaiṣṇava mythology and theology. The Gupta rulers saw themselves as divine instruments of Viṣṇu, the cosmic king. Like Viṣṇu they understood themselves as protecting the earth and cosmic stability in general. The boar *avatāra* of Viṣṇu, who rescues the earth by diving into the primordial waters where she has been taken by a demon and raising her up on his tusk,13 was particularly popular among the Guptas and probably represented a mythological model that expressed their understanding of their political role.14

The fundamental conviction that the earth itself, or the Indian subcontinent itself, is a goddess, indeed, that she is one’s mother, pervades the modern cult of Bhārat Mātā \(Mother India\), in which all Indians are called sons or children of India and are expected to protect their mother without regard for personal hardship and sacrifice. One of the earliest and probably still the most popular literary expressions of this theme is Bankim Chandra Chatterjee’s novel *Ānandamath*, written in the late nineteenth century when the Indian independence movement was beginning to become powerful. The novel is set in Bengal in the late eighteenth century during a great famine. The action centers around a conflict between a band of militant Hindu ascetics and the Muslim rulers of Bengal \(and eventually their British allies\). The ascetics have renounced wealth, prestige, and even their families to devote themselves to the service and freedom of their motherland, Bengal. They are worshipers of Viṣṇu’s man-lion *avatāra*, a particularly ferocious aspect of the divine, while at the same time being devoted to the mother, who is worshiped in concrete form in images of Durgā and Kālī.15 In the context of the novel it is clear that it is not Durgā herself, or Kālī herself, who is the object of reverence on the part of the ascetics \(and the author\). Kālī’s image is interpreted as the present condition of the mother; that is, the mother, under the domination of foreigners, has become naked, poor, and disheveled. Mahendra, the hero of the work, is told as he gazes on her image that the severed arms that adorn her waist as a girdle are the arms of devotees who will have to be sacrificed before the mother can be freed from her foreign yoke.16 For purposes of the novel, Kālī’s appearance—naked, disheveled, and in disarray—becomes a symbol of the present condition of the motherland: a place of sickness, death, poverty, and exploitation.

The band of ascetics are known as the children, and their battle cry is “hail to the mother” \(*bande mātāram*\). All of the children have vowed to serve the mother and have sworn not to return to their families until she is saved.17 When the hero, Mahendra, asks who this mother is, he receives this explicit answer from one of the leaders of the children: “ ‘We own no other mother,’ retorted Bhavānanda; ‘they say, “the mother and the land of birth are higher than heaven.” We think the land of birth to be no other than our mother herself. We have no mother, no father, no brother, no wife, no child, no hearth or home, we have only got the mother.’ “18

Bhavānanda elaborates his answer to Mahendra’s question by singing a hymn in praise of the mother, which is clearly a hymn of praise to the motherland. This hymn became known as the “Bande Mātāram” and was very popular during the independence movement in India.



Hail thee mother\! To thee I bow\!

Who with sweetest water o’erflows

With dainty fruits is rich and endowed

And cooling whom the south wind blows;

Who’s green with crops as on her grow;

To such a mother down I bow\!



With silver moon beams smile her nights

And trees that in her bloom abound

Adorn her; and her face doth beam

With sweetest smiles, sweet’s her sound\!

Joy and bliss she doth bestow;

To such a mother down I bow.



Resounding with triumphal shouts

from seventy million voices bold

With devotion served by twice

As many hands that ably hold

The sharp and shining rapier bold,

—Thou a weakling we are told\!



Proud in strength and prowess thou art,

Redeemer of thy children thou;

Chastiser of aggressive foes;

Mother, to thee thy child I bow.



Thou are knowledge, thou my faith,

Thou my heart and thou my mind.

Nay more, thou art the vital air

That moves my body from behind.

Of my hands thou are the strength,

At my heart devotion thou,

In each temple and each shrine,

To thy image it is we bow.



Durga bold who wields her arms

With half a score of hands,

The science-goddess, Vani too,

And Lakshmi who on lotus stands,—

What are they but, mother, thou,

To thee in all these forms I bow\!



To thee\! Fortune-giver, that art

To fault unknown, beyond compare,

Who dost with sweetest waters flow

And on thy children in thy care

Dainty fruits dost rich bestow,

To thee, mother, to thee I bow\!



To thee I bow, that art so green

And so rich bedecked; with smile

Thy face doth glow; thou dost sustain

And hold us—still unknown to guile\!

Hail thee mother\! To thee I bow\!19

Independent India still cultivates this theme of the motherland as a goddess. The Indian national anthem, composed by Rabindranath Tagore and first sung in 1911 at the Indian National Congress in Calcutta, is in the same vein as Chatterjee’s “Bande Mātāram.”



Thou art the ruler of the minds of all people,

Dispenser of India’s destiny.

Thy name rouses the hearts of Punjab, Sind, Gujarat and Maratha,

Of Dravida and Orissa and Bengal.

It echoes in the hills of Vindhyas and Himalayas, mingles in the music of Jamuna and Ganges and is chanted by the waves of the Indian Sea.

They pray for thy blessings and sing thy praise.

The saving of all people waits in thy hand,

Thou dispenser of India’s destiny.

Victory, victory, victory to thee.20

Concrete expressions of this reverence for India as a feminine deity are not difficult to find in modern India. In Banaras, the spiritual capital of Hinduism, there is a temple dedicated to Bhārat Mātā. Inside the temple, in the place where there would ordinarily be an anthropomorphic image of the goddess, there is a large, colored relief map of the Indian subcontinent. It is to this large map that pilgrims show reverence.21 Insofar as the nation-state represents, is identified with, or is associated with the land itself, it is due reverence. For the land itself is a sacred, nourishing, redemptive presence to those who are born from it and are nourished by it.

## THE ŚĀKTA PĪṬHAS

The myth and cult of the Śākta *pīṭhas* is another vivid expression of the Hindu intuition that the Indian subcontinent itself is a goddess. India is covered with sacred places associated with prominent geographical features of the country. Mountains, hills, rivers, caves, and other sites having some geographical or natural peculiarity are often affirmed to possess sacred power or to be places where one may make contact with the divine. These sites are usually called *tīrthas*, a term that means a place where one fords a river. The term is significant in regard to sacred places in two senses: \(1\) it indicates that rivers themselves are often the site of sacred power, and \(2\) such places are sites where one may cross over from the realm of the profane to the sacred, from the human to the divine, from this world to another world.22 In many cases these sites are associated with deities who are well known in the Hindu tradition and who have an elaborate mythology and cult independent of the sacred site in question. In other cases it seems that the object of sacrality, that which lends the site power, is the place itself and not so much the deity who is associated with the place.23

While it is difficult to establish historically how a given site has become popular as a sacred place, it seems clear that in many cases an awe or reverence for the geographical place itself was crucial in distinguishing it.24 Arduous pilgrimages to remote sites where the central religious rite is to bathe in the waters of a pool or river, enter a cave, or have a view of some geographical feature indicate that the great attraction of many sacred places is tied to the geography of the place. Although temples are often found in such places, the environment rather than the temple itself is usually the object of the pilgrim. The temple simply serves to mark, specify, or objectify the sacrality of the local geography. The temple does not enhance the sacrality of the place so much as the place enhances the sacrality of the temple.

Underlying the extraordinary number of sacred sites associated with geographical places in India seems to be the intuition that the land, the earth, or the Indian subcontinent itself is an immense source or repository of sacred power. Looking at a map of the Indian subcontinent on which only the most famous sacred places are marked, we see that India bubbles with sacrality in every region.25 To a great extent these many *tīrthas*, which are associated with Hindu mythology and epic history, have given India its sense of cultural and historical unity. India has rarely been under central rule. For the most part she has been ruled by several competing kingdoms. The sacrality of the land itself, rather than a unified political tradition, has cultivated among most Hindus the strong sense of Mother India.



The whole of India’s sacred geography, with its many *tīrthas*—those inherent in its natural landscape and those sanctified by the deeds of gods and the footsteps of heroes—is a living geography. As such it has been central for the shaping of an Indian sense of regional and national unity. The recognition of India as sacred landscape, woven together north and south, east and west, by the paths of pilgrims, has created a powerful sense of India as Bhārat Mātā—Mother India.26

Many sacred sites are specifically associated with, identified with, or presided over by a goddess. The pervasiveness of sites sacred to goddesses is suggested by the number of towns and villages that have names associated with different goddesses.



. . . in this vast country, holy resorts of the goddess are innumerable and the popularity of her cult is proved even in the place-names of India. Referring to the Panjab region Prof. Niharranjan Ray observed: “Very few people pause to consider this social phenomenon, or to consider the significance of such toponyms in these regions as, for instance, Ambala which is derived from Amba, one of the many names of Durgā, Chandigarh which is named after Caṇdī, . . . Kalka which is a vulgarisation of Kālika, Simla which is śyāmalā Devī in its anglicised version. A careful and close look at the postal directories of the Punjab, Hariyana and Himachal would yield a long list of such toponyms from which one may draw one’s own conclusion. Besides, throughout these regions one still finds a countless number of small, lowly shrines with all but shapeless or crude forms placed on their altars, which worshippers, lowly village folks, describe as Manasā, Caṇḍī, Kālī, Naynā, Durgā, etc.”27

Many of these sites associated with goddesses are called *pīṭhas*, “seats.” Why the term *pīṭha* is used for those sites in preference to the more traditional and common term *tīrtha* is not entirely clear. *Pīṭha* is preferred, perhaps because it tends to emphasize the rootedness of the goddesses associated with these places. Many of the goddesses are preeminently tied to the locales in which they are worshiped. They are perceived to be not so much transcendent, heavenly beings as beings whose power is firmly grounded in the earth itself. It may be, too, that the term *pīṭha* is appropriate to those aspects of Devī theology which emphasize her association with the earth itself and her motherly nature, which casts her in the role of an ever-present, nurturing presence. Perhaps the point of the term is to emphasize that the Devī is to be understood as firmly located in this world, both in the sense of being identified with it and in the sense of being oriented toward such worldly concerns of her devotees as fertility, well-being, and long life.28 While the term *tīrtha* has connotations of crossing from this world to another world, the term *pīṭha* connotes a fixed point, and by extension the fixedness of the goddesses worshiped at these sites.

Sometime in the medieval period an attempt was made to affirm the basic unity of all *pīṭhas* sacred to goddesses.29 The assumption behind this attempt was that the Mahādevī underlies all the particular manifestations of goddesses residing at the many *pīṭhas*. Mythologically this idea was expressed by adding an episode to the myth of Satī’s self-destruction at Dakṣa’s sacrifice. In the expanded version of the myth Śiva arrives at Dakṣa’s sacrifice having received the news that Satī has killed herself. He picks up her body and, racked with grief, begins to wander the cosmos. He is so distraught by Satī’s death and so grieved by the presence of her corpse that he completely ignores his divine responsibilities. His sobbing and grief threaten the stability of the world. Viṣṇu is called upon to remedy the situation. He enters Satī’s body by yoga or else slices pieces of her body off bit by bit, but in one way or another he disposes of her body a bit at a time.30 When Śiva discovers that Satī’s body is gone, he recovers his divine composure and stops grieving. Where the parts of Satī’s body fell, sacred places called *pīṭhas* were then established. The number of *pīṭhas* varies from 4 to 110 in the different accounts of the tale.31

In most accounts of this myth and in most lists of the *pīṭhas*, Satī’s yoni is said to have fallen and been enshrined at Kāmagiri in the region of Kāmarūpa in Assam, where the goddess is worshiped as Kāmākhyā. Although goddess worship is undoubtedly ancient in this part of India32 and although Kāmarūpa is mentioned in the Allahabad pillar inscription of Samudragupta \(middle of the fourth century\), the present temple of Kāmākhyā near Gauhati does not date beyond the sixteenth century. In the seventeenth century the Ahom kings of Assam encouraged the worship of Kāmākhyā on a grand scale, and her centrality in the *pīṭha* mythology probably originates around this time. In the Kāmākhyā temple at Kāmagiri, the central image of the goddess is a yoni carved in stone and smeared with red paste symbolizing blood.33 Rituals are done at the temple each month to signify the Devī’s menstruation. This famous center of goddess worship, in short, reveres and enshrines a sacred place that is affirmed to be the creative orifice of a goddess whose larger body is the earth itself or at least the local mountain and region.

According to this myth, then, the Indian subcontinent has been sacralized by the remains of Satī. India is in effect her burial ground.34 The subcontinent is sown with the pieces of Satī’s body, which make the land especially sacred.35 The myth also stresses that the numerous and varied *pīṭhas* and goddesses worshiped at them are part of a larger, unified whole. Each *pīṭha* represents a part of Satī’s body or one of her ornaments;36 taken together, the *pīṭhas* found throughout India constitute or point toward a transcendent \(or, perhaps better, a universally immanent\) goddess whose being encompasses, underlies, and unifies the Indian subcontinent as a whole. In short, the Indian subcontinent is the goddess Satī.

Although the myth speaks of the dismemberment of Satī’s corpse, the emphasis at the *pīṭhas* is not on the worship of Satī’s relics but on the worship of living goddesses, who are all understood as manifestations of the living Mahādevī. The point is not so much that India is the reliquary of the Devī’s corpse as it is that India is the Devī’s living body. The myth provides a vantage point from which the many local and regional goddess cults throughout India may be understood as part of a larger, unified vision in which each act of devotion to a local goddess becomes an act of reverence to the divinity of India as a whole.

## THE GANGES AND THE SACRALITY OF RIVERS

Geographical sacrality in the Hindu tradition is also dramatically expressed in the reverence shown to almost every river of the Indian subcontinent. This reverence extends all the way back to the *Ṛg-veda*, where the idea is expressed that earthly rivers have their origin in heaven. In the *Ṛg-veda* the Sarasvatī River is praised as a mighty goddess who blesses her devotees with health, long life, and poetic inspiration.37 The earthly Sarasvatī River is said to be only a partial manifestation of the goddess Sarasvatī, for she is said to exist in heaven as well as on earth. The earthly river is an extension or continuation of divine waters that flow from heaven to earth. In Ṛg-vedic cosmology the creation of the world or the process of making the world habitable is associated with the freeing of the heavenly waters by Indra. Indra’s enemy Vṛtra is said to have withheld these waters, thus inhibiting creation. When Indra defeats Vṛtra the waters rush onto the earth like mother cows eager to suckle their young \(10.9\). The rivers of the earth are therefore seen as being necessary to creation and as having a heavenly origin. They are brought to earth by the heroic act of a god who defeats a demon who has hoarded the waters and kept them from fertilizing and nourishing the earth in the form of rivers.38

Reverence for rivers in the Hindu tradition is nowhere more intense than in the case of the Ganges. Like the Sarasvatī River in the Vedic tradition, the Ganges is said to have its origin in heaven. Many myths concerning the descent of the Ganges to earth emphasize this point. The oldest and probably best known concerns the restoration of the sixty thousand sons of King Sagara. According to this myth, Sagara’s sons were dull-witted and impetuous, and while searching the world for their father’s sacrificial horse they insulted and disturbed the tranquillity of the great sage Kapila. In anger, Kapila burned them all to ashes with the fire that he had generated as the result of his great austerities. Sagara’s descendants, despite their piety and ascetic efforts, were unable to restore their incinerated forefathers until the saintly and mighty Bhagīratha, the great-great-great-grandson of Sagara, undertook the task. Giving his kingdom over to a trusted minister, Bhagīratha went to the Himalayas to do heroic austerities. After he had physically mortified himself for centuries, the Ganges appeared in bodily form and granted his wish: she would descend to the earth, provided that someone could be found to break her mighty fall, which otherwise would destroy the earth itself. Śiva was persuaded to receive the Ganges on his head, and so the great heavenly river descended to earth, her mighty fall softened by Śiva’s massive tangle of hair. In his hair she became divided into many streams, each of which flowed to a different region of earth and sanctified that area. Her principal artery emerged from Śiva’s hair and came to India, and under Bhagīratha’s guidance it cut a channel to where the ashes of Sagara’s sons were piled. Moistened by her waters, the souls of the sixty thousand sons were purified and freed to undertake their journey to the land of their fathers, where they could be duly honored by their descendants.39

Other accounts of the Ganges’ descent feature Viṣṇu and sometimes Kṛṣṇa. After assuming his dwarf *avatāra* to trick the demon Bali, Viṣṇu strides across the cosmos to appropriate it for the gods. On his third stride his foot strikes the vault of heaven and breaks it. The Ganges River pours through the hole and eventually finds its way to earth. Falling on Mount Meru, the cosmic axis, the Ganges divides into four parts, and as it flows onto the four world continents it purifies the world in every direction.40 In some versions of the myth the god Brahmā, who is said to hold the heavenly Ganges in his water pot, pours the Ganges on Viṣṇu’s foot when it stretches into the heavenly sphere.41 In still other versions of the myth Viṣṇu becomes liquified when he hears a particularly sublime song sung in his praise, and in this form he enters Brahmā’s water pot, which contains the Ganges, and thus sacralizes her.42

In one way or another, these myths about the Ganges’ coming to earth stress the river’s heavenly origin, her essentially divine nature, and her association with the great male deities Brahmā, Viṣṇu, and Śiva. Spilling out of heaven from Viṣṇu’s foot, containing Viṣṇu’s liquified essence according to some myths, and falling onto Śiva’s head, where she meanders through his tangled locks, the mighty Ganges appears in this world after having been made more sacred by direct contact with Viṣṇu and Śiva. The river then spreads the divine potency of these gods into the world when she flows onto the earthly plane. She gives their sacred presences to the earth in liquid form.43 The myths make clear that the earthly Ganges is only a limited part of the cosmic river that flows in heaven and descends to other regions and worlds as well as this one. As mighty as the Ganges appears here, the earthly river is only a limited aspect of a reality that transcends this world. The Ganges, these myths insists, points beyond itself to a transcendent, cosmic dimension that locates the source of the river in a divine sphere.

Another important theme in the reverence for rivers in Hinduism is the purifying quality of rivers and of running water in general. The purity-conscious Hindu social system, in which pollution is inevitably accumulated in the course of a normal day, prescribes a ritual bath as the simplest way to rid oneself of impurities. This act consists of little more than pouring a handful of cold water over one’s head and letting it run down one’s body. Moving, flowing, or falling water is believed to have great cleansing power; a mere sprinkling of water over one’s head or a dip in a stream is sufficient to remove most kinds of daily pollution accumulated through normal human intercourse with those in a state less pure that one’s own.44 Like fire, the other great natural purifying element in Hinduism,45 water is affirmed to contain intrinsic powers of purification, particularly when in motion.

The most awesome manifestations of moving water in the Hindu context are the great rivers of the Indian subcontinent. Ever moving, ever the same, apparently inexhaustible, such rivers as the Jumna, Cauvery, Narmada, Brahmaputra, and Ganges are revered in particular for their great purifying powers. The myths concerning the heavenly origin of such rivers as the Ganges make the point that the mighty rivers of India are in essence uncontaminated by the impurities of the world, that they arise and for the most part flow in celestial realms before falling to earth. Once descended to earth, however, these same rivers literally wash away the accumulated impurities of the realms they traverse. As a handful of water sprinkled over a person’s head cleanses that person, so the river cleanses the entire world when she falls on Mount Meru. The Ganges, Jumna, Cauvery, and countless other rivers and streams are understood to perform a continuous, gracious process of purifying the earth and her inhabitants.



The goddess Gaṅgā. Sena, twelfth century A.D., Bengal. C. sivaramamurti, *Gaṅgā* \(New Delhi: Orient Longman, 1976\), fig. 29, p. 62.

The physical evidence of this continuous process of purification is the clarity of a river’s swiftly flowing source compared to its broad, sluggish, murky mouth before it enters the sea. A river may take on an increasingly impure appearance the farther it travels from its source. Rivers like the Ganges are nevertheless held to be equally purifying from source to mouth. While the source of the Ganges and the place where it breaks out of the mountains onto the plains are important pilgrimage sites, the lower Ganges also has many places of great sanctity. Banaras itself, perhaps the most sacred site in all of India, is far downstream on the Ganges. Though great removers of pollution, the rivers remain uncontaminated by what they remove, staying ever pure, ever potent, ever gracious to all those who come to them for purification.

Although all rivers are revered as removers of pollution, the Ganges is preeminent among India’s rivers as a purifying power. Hymns extolling the Ganges repeatedly emphasize the miraculously purifying powers of her waters. The *Agni-purāṇa* says that the river makes those regions she flows through into sacred ground, that bathing in her waters is an experience similar to being in heaven, that those afflicted with blindness and other ailments become like gods after bathing in her waters, that the Ganges has made pure thousands of impure people who have seen, touched, or drunk her waters.46 To die while being immersed in the Ganges results in *mokṣa*, final spiritual liberation. Being brushed by a breeze containing even a drop of Ganges water erases all sins accumulated over lifetimes.47 In the *Bṛhaddharma-purāṇa* a sinful king is said to have been spared an untimely death because he lived for a while with a merchant who used to bathe in the Ganges.48 The *Mahābhāgavata-purāṇa* tells the story of a robber who, though sent to hell after death, was subsequently sent to Śiva’s heaven because his flesh was eaten by a jackal who had drunk Ganges water \(74\).

In the Gupta and early medieval periods it was common for the personified images of the Ganges and Jumna to flank the doorways of temples.49 The Ganges’ role as threshold figure in these periods probably had to do with both her \(and the Jumna’s\) purificatory powers. The Ganges’ heavenly origin and descent to the earth made her an intermediary between the earthly and heavenly realms. She is a continuous, liquid link between the two worlds. Her location at the thresholds of temples was appropriate in that she connected and formed a transition between the worlds of men and gods. Her position at the doorways of temples probably also indicated her role as remover of pollution. Before entering the sacred realm of the gods, which a temple represents, devotees should cleanse themselves of worldly impurities. Crossing the threshold of a temple flanked by images of the goddesses Gaṅgā and Yamunā, devotees probably were symbolically cleansed in the purificatory waters of these rivers.

The Ganges’ location as a threshold figure in medieval temples also suggests the threshold function of the physical Ganges River \(and other rivers\). The most common name for a sacred place in Hinduism is *tīrtha*, which means a place for crossing over from one place to another, especially a place for crossing a river, a fording place. As applied to sacred places the term signifies a place at which one may cross from one plane of reality to another, in particular, a place where one can cross from the earthly plane to the divine plane, or from the limited human sphere to the unconditioned divine sphere. As a sacred place, as a *tīrtha*, the Ganges is prototypical. Her waters are affirmed to orginate in heaven and to flow in a continuous stream into the earthly sphere. The Ganges is often called she who flows in the three worlds \(Triloka-patha-gaminī\).50 She is a liquid *axis mundi*, a pathway connecting all spheres of reality, a presence at which or in which one may cross over to another sphere of the cosmos, ascend to heavenly worlds, or transcend human limitations. As Diana Eck has so nicely put it: “It is because the Gaṅgā descended in her *avataraṇa* that she is a place of ascent as a *tīrtha*.”51 Flowing out into the world, the Ganges moves according to rhythms and currents that originate in heaven. Her waters have had physical contact with the great gods Viṣṇu and Śiva. She is a sacred bridge to those realms from which she has come.

The Ganges’ role as a mediator between this world and the divine worlds, as a place at which or in which crossings may be made, is clear in the context of death rituals.52 A strong and widespread Hindu belief is that to die in the Ganges, or to have a few drops of Ganges water poured on one’s lips just prior to death, is to gain immediate liberation.53 Although any part of the Ganges is believed to have this redemptive power, the cult of seeking to die in contact with the Ganges is most active in Banaras, where special hostels for the dying accommodate the thousands of pious Hindus who make a final pilgrimage from all over India to die on the banks of the Ganges there.54 The Ganges is understood to be a particularly accessible bridge from one mode of being to the other, a sure crossing point in the difficult transition from life to death or from bondage to liberation.

Another strong and widespread belief in India is that having their ashes or bones thrown into the Ganges guarantees the dead a safe journey to the realm of the ancestors. Against this background the story of the redemption of Sagara’s sons makes sense. Cursed to eternal banishment from the realm of the ancestors, the souls of Sagara’s sons can only reach the goal of the dead by means of contact with the Ganges, which provides them a special route to heaven. In this role the Ganges is known especially by the epithet Svārga-sopana-saranī \(she who is a flowing staircase to heaven\).55 Pious Hindus make a pilgrimage to various points on the banks of the Ganges to cast the ashes of their ancestors and kin onto the waters of the Ganges so that they, like the sons of Sagara, will be ensured a successful transition to the realm of the dead. Just as the mighty waters of the Ganges are envisioned in Hindu cosmology as continuously descending from heaven to earth, so a continuous procession of souls is ascending the Ganges to transcendent realms.56

The Ganges as the surest access between the worlds of the living and the dead is also seen in *śrāddha* and *tarpaṇa* rituals, which are performed in honor of ancestors. These rites frequently stipulate Ganges water as desirable. The intention of these rites is to nourish the ancestors, the *pitṛs*, in the heavenly sphere. The use of Ganges water may be understood both as nourishing the ancestors directly and as representing the means by which the other offerings to the ancestors will reach the desired realm. The use of Ganges water guarantees the efficacy of the rites by making the Ganges present as a *tīrtha*, a crossing point from the world of the living to the world of the dead.

A particularly strong motif in reverence to the Ganges is her presence to her devotees as a mother. Gaṅgā Mā, “Mother Ganges,” is probably the river’s most popular epithet. Like a mother or as a mother the Ganges is here in the world to comfort her children. She is tangible, approachable, and all-accepting. All who approach her for comfort and blessing are enveloped by her yielding, redemptive waters. She is the distilled essence of compassion in liquid form. No one is denied her blessing. Jagganātha, the author of the *Gaṅgā Laharī*, probably the most famous hymn in praise of the Ganges, was outcast by his fellow Hindus for having a love affair with a Muslim woman. He says that he was even shunned by untouchables and madmen. He declares that he was so despicable, so polluted, that none of the *tīrthas* was able to cleanse him.57 The Ganges alone was willing to accept him and cleanse him, and he in gratitude praises her as a loving mother:



I come to you as a child to his mother.

I come as an orphan to you, moist with love.

I come without refuge to you, giver of sacred rest.

I come a fallen man to you, uplifter of all.

I come undone by disease to you, the perfect physician.

I come, my heart dry with thirst, to you, ocean of sweet wine.

Do with me whatever you will.58

The Ganges’ maternal aspect is seen especially in her nourishing qualities. Her waters are sometimes likened to milk or *amṛta*, the drink of immortality.59 “The concept of the river in India is that of a sustaining mother. The stream of the river carries *payas*. The word *payas* stands for both water and milk. Appropriately this has been used in relation to the river as the stream that sustains the people, her children, with water, as a mother sustains her babies with her milk.”60 Her waters are life-giving, nourishing to all those who bathe in or drink them.61 Her waters have miraculous vivifying powers. The ashes of Sagara’s sons, and the ashes of the dead in general, are enlivened, invigorated, or otherwise made strong enough by the touch of her waters to make the journey to heaven.

As a mother, the Ganges nourishes the land through which it flows, making it fertile. Historically, the land along the banks of the Ganges has been intensely cultivated. It is particularly fertile because of the sediment periodically deposited by the flood waters of the river and because of irrigation. Images of the Ganges often show her carrying a plate of food and a *pūrṇakumbha*, an overflowing pot.62 Mother Ganges is depicted as a being overflowing with food and life-giving waters, as one who continually nourishes all she comes in contact with. As giver of food and as water that makes fields rich with crops, the Ganges bestows her blessings concretely in this world. She makes the earth abundant with crops and thereby sustains and enriches life. As the bestower of worldly blessings the Ganges is particularly approached to ensure healthy crops and to promote fertility in women. “Today in Bihar, at the start of the plowing season, before the seeds are sown, farmers put Ganga water in a pot and set it in a special place in the field to ensure good harvest. Among those who live along the river, a newly married woman unfolds her sari to Ganga and prays for children and the long life of her husband.”63

The waters of the Ganges are also often used to restore the health of sick people.64 The miraculous restorative powers of the Ganges is the subject of many stories. In one of the Buddhist *Jataka* tales we read of a parrot who lived in a fig tree. The tree’s fruit sustained the bird and also provided him shelter. Over the years the parrot became exceedingly devoted to the tree, which had acted as his benefactor throughout his life. Hearing of the devotion of the parrot, the king of the area wished to test the bird’s fidelity and magically dried up the tree. But the bird remained. Impressed with the bird’s loyalty the king granted the parrot a wish. The bird asked that the tree be restored. Thereupon the king “took up the water from the Ganges in his hand and dashed it against the fig-tree stump. Straightaway the tree rose up rich in branch and stem, with honey-sweet fruit, and stood a charming sight, like the bare Jewel-Mountain.”65

The Ganges’ relationship with Śiva suggests a structure similar to the rhythmic interdependence of opposites in Śiva’s relationship with Pārvatī.66 The Ganges, like Pārvatī, her co-wife, represents the cool, nourishing, fertile dimension of reality that calms, contains, or offsets the fierce, hot, destructive powers of Śiva. The most dramatic expression of this relationship is found in the myth concerning the birth of Kārttikeya. When Śiva spills his semen it is so powerfully hot that it cannot be contained even by Agni himself. After passing through a series of containers, none of which is able to contain it for long, the semen falls into the Ganges and is cooled there. Within the cooling womb of Mother Ganges the semen takes on embryonic form, and the war god Kārttikeya is duly born.67

The practice in many Śiva temples of pouring Ganges water on Śiva’s liṅga also suggests the cooling, calming effect of the Ganges. Śiva’s fiery, hot, hard character is complemented and made accessible by the soft, cooling effect the Ganges has on him. The pouring of Ganges water on the liṅga, which goes on continuously from dawn till dusk in some temples,68 is also reminiscent of the Ganges’ descent from heaven onto Śiva’s head. Śiva’s consent to accept the mighty weight of the Ganges to break her fall to earth effectively involves him in worldly matters, drawing him away from isolated meditation. The Ganges’ meandering course through Śiva’s locks and through the regions of the earth physically connects the aloof god’s presence with the earth. By tangibly connecting Śiva with the earth the Ganges extends his presence into the world. In a quite physical and literal way the Ganges acts as Śiva’s *śakti*, permitting his redemptive presence to spread to the world and his devotees, who yearn for his grace. By means of the Ganges Śiva’s otherwise dangerous, destructive, fierce presence is transmitted into an approachable reality accessible to all.69

Behind the many myths that exalt the Ganges as a great goddess and associate her with Śiva, Viṣṇu, Brahmā, and other deities lies an enduring reverence for the river itself. Behind the lofty hymns of praise that affirm the Ganges’ miraculous powers to effect renewed health, fertility, a safe journey to the land of the ancestors, and spiritual liberation, there is a fundamental affection for the physical river that meanders across the North Indian plains. The extent to which it is the physical Ganges River itself that is adored by Hindus is evident in the persistent habit of pilgrims to see, touch, be sprinkled with, and bathe in the river’s waters. It is not anthropomorphic images of the Ganges that attract reverence and worship, although such images are common enough. It is the river itself that is worshiped. Devotees honor other deities by draping a garland around the neck of the image. They worship the Ganges by stringing the garland of flowers across the river itself. Similarly, while it is auspicious to circumambulate the image of a deity, some adventurous devotees circumambulate the Ganges by traveling up one bank and down the other along her entire course.70 In Diana Eck’s phrase, the Ganges is an “organic symbol,” not a narrative symbol. In the case of the Ganges, and in the case of the Hindu reverence for the sacrality of the land, the organic *is* the sacred.



For the Gaṅgā’s significance as a symbol is not exhaustively narrative. First, she is a river that flows with waters of life in a vibrant universe. Narrative myths come and go in history. They may shape the cosmos and convey meaning for many generations, and then they may gradually lose their hold upon the imagination and may finally be forgotten. But the river remains, even when the stories are no longer repeated. The river flows on, bringing life and conveying the living tradition, even to those of this age for whom everything else is demythologized.71

Reverence for and worship of the Ganges is yet another vivid affirmation that the geography of India itself is somehow redemptive, that simply being in contact with this place, dwelling upon it, imbues people with salvific strength.
