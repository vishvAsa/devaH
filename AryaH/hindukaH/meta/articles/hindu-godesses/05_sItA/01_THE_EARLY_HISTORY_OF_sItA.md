title = "01 THE EARLY HISTORY OF SĪTĀ"

+++

The word *sītā* means “furrow,” “the line made by the plow,” and is the name of a goddess associated with plowed fields in Vedic literature. In a hymn addressed to the lord of the fields, Kṣetrapati, Sītā is invoked as follows:

Auspicious Sītā, come thou near:  
we venerate and worship thee

That thou mayst bless and prosper us  
and bring us fruits abundantly.

May Indra press the furrow down,  
may Pūshan guide its course aright.

May she, as rich in milk, be drained for us  
through each succeeding year.2

In the *Kauśika-sūtra* Sītā is the wife of Parjanya, a god associated with rain. She is the “mother of gods, mortals and creatures” \(7c\)3 and is petitioned for growth and prosperity \(6\).4 In the *Parāskara-sūtra* Sītā is the wife of Indra, a god often associated with rain and fertility, and is offered cooked rice and barley in the sacrificial fire \(2.17.1-19\).5 In the *Vājasaneyi-saṁhitā* Sītā is invoked when four furrows are drawn during a sacrificial ritual \(12.69-72\). This is reminiscent of plowing the ground upon which the fire altar is built during the Agnicayana ritual, an act apparently intended to ensure the abundance and fertility of the crops.6 Sītā is also invoked as one of the names of the goddess Āryā in the *Harivaṁśa* \(2.3.14\).

O goddess, you are the altar’s center in the sacrifice,

The priest’s fee,

Sītā to those who hold the plough,

And Earth to all living beings.7

Sītā is not a very significant deity prior to the *Rāmāyaṇa* of Vālmīki. She is not mentioned very often and is overshadowed by much more popular goddesses associated with fertility, such as Śrī-Lakṣmī. Nevertheless, Sītā does seem to be part of a fundamental intuition concerning the fertility of the plowed earth and the necessity of a male power to awaken, arouse, and inseminate her. Underlying Sītā’s connection with Indra, Parjanya, and other male deities associated with the inseminating effects of rain seems to be the basic perception that the ongoing fertility of the cosmos is the result of the interaction between the sky and the earth, between male and female, between the latent powers of the field and the inseminating effects of the plow, which opens the earth for the insertion of seeds into her fertile interior.
