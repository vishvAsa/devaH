It should also be noted in reference to Rādhā’s lofty status that in most North Indian Kṛṣṇa temples and shrines the central image is of Kṛṣṇa *and* Rādhā.

23. Kinsley, *The Divine Player,* pp. 109-110. The contemporary expression of this idea is seen in the invocation addressed to Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa at the beginning of a religious drama in Brindavan: “Homage to Radha, Krishna’s essence, and Krishna, the essence of Radha” \(Hawley, *At Play with Krishna,* p. 168\).
