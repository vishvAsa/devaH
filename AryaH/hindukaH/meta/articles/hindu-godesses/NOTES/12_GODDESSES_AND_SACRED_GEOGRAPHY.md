1. See the section on Pṛthivī in my chapter 1.

2. An even earlier example of this idea is found in *Ṛg-veda* 10.90, where the creation of the world is described as the result of the sacrifice of a giant being who is dismembered. The parts of the world are composed of the parts of his body.

3. Wendy O’Flaherty, *Asceticism and Eroticism in the Mythology of Śiva* \(London: Oxford University Press, 1973\), passim, has shown that a similar idea underlies much of śaivite mythology. Śiva alternates between two poles, the ascetic and the erotic, the former creating great reserves of energy that are released when Śiva enters his erotic phase.

4. The idea pervades the entire section of the *Śatapatha-brāhmaṇa,* which deals with the elaborate rituals involved in building the fire altar. The idea that the world is periodically evolved out of a cosmic being is also seen in the mythology of Viṣṇu, who inhales the world after it has worn down at the end of the Kali Yuga and then gives it rebirth when it emerges from a great lotus that grows from his navel. The origin of the world from a giant being is also seen in the opening passage of the *Bṛhadāraṇyaka-upaniṣad,* where the world is said to have been created from a great sacrificial horse.

5. For example, *Bhāgavata-purāṇa* 10.1.17-22, where Viṣṇu decides to take the form of Kṛṣṇa because of the earth’s complaint about Kamsa.

6. For example, T. A. Gopinatha Rao, *Elements of Hindu Iconography,* 2d ed., 2 vols. \(New York: Paragon, 1968\), vol. 1, pt. 1, pls. 22, 23, 25, 26, 27.

7. See my chapters 2, “śrī-Lakṣmī,” and 9, “The Mahādevī”.”

8. For example, *Devī-bhāgavata-purāṇa* 4.19.23-24.

9. For example, *Devī-māhātmya* 1.59; *5.7; Lalitā-sahasranāma* 397; *Saundaryalaharī* 11; *Devī-bhāgavata-purāṇa,* passim.

10. Jainism contains a similar vision of the universe as a cosmic giant, whose lower limbs are identified with the nether worlds.

23. In some cases the two—the geographical place and the deity—are hardly distinguishable. See below \(pp. 187-196\) on the sacrality of rivers and the Ganges.

24. Eck, *Banaras,* p. 157, has shown that in myths concerning the origins of Banaras it was the beauty and holiness of the city that attracted Śiva to it in the first place. The sacrality of Banaras, then, does not stem primarily from the fact that it is Śiva’s city, although Śiva’s residing there enhances its sacrality.

25. For example, Agehananda Bharati, “Pilgrimage Sites and Indian Civilization,” in Joseph W. Elder, ed., *Chapters in Indian Civilization* \(Dubuque, Iowa: Kendall/Hunt Publishing Co., 1970\), p. 102; Surinder Mohan Bhardwaj, *Hindu Places of Pilgrimage in India* \(Berkeley, Los Angeles, London: University of California Press, 1973\), passim.

34. In much the same way when the remains of the Buddha were enshrined in stupas they sacralized India and other countries to which Buddhism spread.

35. Although the myth tries to be universal in the sense of applying to all areas of India, it is most applicable to northern areas of India and to goddesses worshiped at northern shrines. In most versions of the myth it is clear that southern geography is not well known, while the regions of Bengal, Assam, and the Northwest are often known in great detail. Bengal, Assam, and the Northwest were and still are centers of Tantric worship, and the cult of the *pīṭhas* may be related to Tantric masters and the sites at which they performed their *sādhana.* Some texts instruct the Tantric adept to “place” the goddesses enshrined at the *pīṭhas* into various parts of his body by means of the *nyāsa* ritual. In this way the adept identifies himself, piece by piece, with the goddess he worships. Sircar, *The Śākta pīṭhas,* pp. 3, 15-17; N. Bhattacharyya, *History of the Śākta Religion,* pp. 119-122.

43. Conversely, the Ganges is understood as purifying the deities she comes in contact with; C. Sivaramamurti, *Gaṅgā* \(New Delhi: Orient Longman, 1976\), p. 45.

45. The generation of *tapas* \(heat or fire\) as a result of ascetic practices is a good example of the purifying role of fire, as is the understanding of the cremation fire as a final purifying act.
