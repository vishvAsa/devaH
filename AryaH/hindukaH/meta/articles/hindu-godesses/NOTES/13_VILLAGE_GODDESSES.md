1. For example, S. C. Dube, *Indian Village* \(New York: Harper and Row, 1967\), p. 96. Dube mentions four goddesses in a village of under 2,500; these goddesses are associated with different castes.

12. In South India a common distinction is made between right-division castes and left-division castes. The former are agriculturally based and tied to the land, whereas the latter are urban based and pursue artisan-related skills in their traditional occupations. In festivals in honor of village goddesses, the right-division castes tend to play a more central role. For example, the *pūjāris,* ritual priests at the village-goddess festivals, come from the right-division castes. This may be because the right-division castes are closer to the soil and have more at stake in terms of the well-being of the village. Traditionally the left-division castes have been more mobile and less tied to one specific locale. See Brenda E. F. Beck, *Peasant Society in Konku: A Study of Right and Left Subcastes in South India* \(Vancouver: University of British Columbia Press, 1972\), p. 118; and Brubaker, “The Ambivalent Mistress,” pp. 182, 191.

48. Śītalā is popular across North India and is worshiped particularly during the height of the dry season, when smallpox was most easily spread. Although smallpox has been eradicated, śītālā is still widely worshiped to help alleviate or prevent skin diseases and to help solve personal problems. One of the largest and busiest temples in Banaras is a śītālā temple. Most of her shrines, though, are small and primarily attract local residents during the dry season.
