1. Sometimes the idea of *śruti* is narrowed to mean primarily the *Upaniṣads.* The idea of *śruti* often also includes the *Bhāgavad-gītā,* which is much later than most Vedic literature.

2. For example, Sukumari Bhattacharji, *The Indian Theogony* \(Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1970\), pp. 160–161; Stella Kramrisch, “The Indian Great Goddess,” *History of Religions* 14, no. 4 \(May 1975\): 235–265.

22. See my chapater 4, “Sarasvatī.”

24. In Vedic literature some gods are frequently identified or associated with each other. We have noted above, for example, that Pṛthivi and Dyaus, Vāc and Sarasvatī, and Pṛthivi and Aditi are often identified or associated with each other. These identifications, however, are selective and consistent and should not lead us to suppose that the authors of Vedic literature presupposed that all deities were manifestations of one great god or one great goddess. While a very strong and articulate monistic position arises in Upaniṣadic literature, there are only hints of this position in earlier Vedic texts.

25. See my chapter 9, “The Mahādevī.”

26. In the *Brāhmaṇas* Pṛthivi is identified with Aditi, and Sarasvatī is sometimes identified with Vāc.
