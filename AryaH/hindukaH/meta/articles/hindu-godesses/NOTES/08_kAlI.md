12. Some renditions of Śiva’s dance, in which the entire Hindu pantheon is shown as spectators or musicians, do include Kālī standing passively by: for example, the painting at the sixteenth-century Śiva temple at Ettumanur \(Sivaramamurti, *Nataraja in Art,* fig. 150, p. 282\) and the scene from a seventeenth-century temple at Triprayār, Kerala \(ibid., fig. 152, p. 284\). In both scenes Kālī rides a *preta* \(ghost\), and her appearance is unchanged.

13. That Śiva should have to resort to his *tāṇḍava* dance to defeat K*ā*lī suggests the theme of Kālī’s inciting Śiva to destructive activity. Śiva’s *tāṇṇava* dance is typically performed at the end of the cosmic age and destroys the universe. Descriptions of it often dwell on its destructive aspects. The chaotic dancing of Śiva, who wields a broken battle-ax, must be tempered by the soft glances of Pārvatī \(Sivaramamurti, *Nataraja in Art,* p. 138\). Śiva tends to get out of control in his *tāṇḍava* dance, and in the legend of the dance contest with Kālī, it is she who provokes him to it.

25. In at least one Tantric text Kālī is identified with Lakṣmī and by implication Viṣṇu *\(Lakṣmī-tantra* 8.13\).

26. Throughout North India Kālī is associated with Bengal, where she is most popular. Outside Bengal, for example, her temples will be established by Bengalis, Bengalis will often act as her temple priests, or the image of Kālī in the temple will be said to have some connection with Bengal.

35. In *Purity and Danger: An Analysis of Concepts of Pollution and Taboo* \(Harmondsworth: Penguin Books, 1970\), Mary Douglas locates taboo in the idea of dirt out of place. In a sense Kālī may be regarded as taboo, a dangerous being out of place in the civilized sphere.

38. The term *Anti-structure* is used here in the way Turner uses it, as a positive phenomenon that enables a culture to step outside itself in order to perceive itself more clearly. Anti-structure is not necessarily chaotic or destructive.

39. The story is told in the *Adbhūta Rāmāyaṇa,* the Oriyan *Rāmāyaṇa* of Sāralā Dāsa, and the Bengali *Jaiminibharata Rāmāyaṇa;* Narendra Nath Bhatta-charyya, *History of the Śākta Religion* \(New Delhi: Munshiram Manoharlal Publishers, 1974\), p. 149.
