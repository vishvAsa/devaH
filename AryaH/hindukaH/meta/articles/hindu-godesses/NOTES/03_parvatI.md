25. The idea that heat is accumulated by doing austerities may have to do with the obvious phenomenon that heat is expended with vigorous exercise. One loses heat when acting in the world, one sweats when exerting oneself. Asceticism generally involves withdrawal from the world and the severe restricting of most normal bodily functions, particularly sex. By thus stopping or hindering the normal outflow or leakage of heat one accumulates great amounts of heat, which may then be used to burn away impurities, to threaten or harm an opponent, or to force the gods to grant a boon.

51. *Śiva-purāṇa,* Rudra-saṁhitā 3.12.28-33.

52. Śiva sometimes plays the role of subduing or taming a goddess. This goddess is usually the fierce, wild Kālī or a goddess who plays the role of a warrior, such as Mīnāksi. Prior to her taming or her marriage to Śiva, the goddess in these stories is described as dangerous. See David Shulman, *Tamil Temple Myths* \(Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1980\), pp. 176-211. It has also been argued that outside of marriage, or prior to marriage, goddesses are generally fierce and dangerous, but they are tamed when married. The implication of this is that the male deity somehow tames the goddess to whom he becomes married. See Lawrence A. Babb, *The Divine Hierarchy: Popular Hinduism in Central India* \(New York: Columbia University Press, 1975\), pp. 217-226. In the case of Pārvatī and Śiva, though, it is Śiva who needs taming, and he is tamed by Pārvatī; she is never described as dangerous or wild prior to her marriage to Śiva.
