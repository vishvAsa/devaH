## THE MAHĀVIDYĀS

The Mahāvidyās \(great revelations or manifestations\) are a group of ten goddesses who are mentioned rather late in the Hindu literary tradition. Although some of the goddesses in this group are individually important and date back to a much earlier time \(Kalī, for example\), the group as a whole seems to be a medieval iconographic and mythological expression of an aspect of Mahādevī theology. An important point in Mahādevī theology is the Devī’s tendency to display or manifest herself in a great variety of forms.1 Many myths about the Devī describe her as producing goddesses from different parts of her body,2 and she often announces to her petitioners that she assumes different forms at different times in order to maintain cosmic stability.3 All ten of the Mahāvidyās are often depicted in goddess temples throughout India today. They seem to be fairly well known to many Hindus. They do not seem to be individually revered when shown as a group but rather seem to represent a common way of expressing the idea that the particular goddess who dwells in the temple takes many forms.

The ten Mahāvidyās, at least in part, are probably a Śākta version of the central Vaiṣṇava idea of Viṣṇu’s ten *avatāras*, who appear from time to time to maintain the order of dharma. Indeed, the *Guhyātiguhya-tantra* gives a list of the Mahāvidyās and identifies each one with an *avatāra* of Viṣṇu, stating that the *avatāras* of Viṣṇu arose initially from the different Mahāvidyās. Kālī is said to have become Kṛṣṇa, Chinnamastā to have become Narasiṁha, and so on.4 The Devī”, like Viṣṇu, is understood in Mahadevī theology to be the creator and maintainer of cosmic order. Indeed, one might argue that the authors of some Śākta texts extolling the Devī have patterned her quite self-consciously on Viṣṇu himself.5 The ten Mahāvidyās, however, are more than a Śākta version of the Vaiṣṇava ten *avatāras*, or at least the Mahāvidyās differ significantly from the *avatāras* in appearance and function.

The origin of the ten Mahāvidyās in Hindu mythology takes place in the context of the story of Satī and Śiva. Satī’s father, Dakṣa, decides to perform a great sacrifice and invites all the inhabitants of the heavenly spheres to attend. The only couple he does not invite are Śiva and Satī. Dakṣa does not like his son-in-law because of Śiva’s uncivilized habits and disheveled appearance and so purposely neglects to invite him to the sacrifice. Śiva is not offended by this social slight, but his wife Satī is greatly insulted and announces to Śiva that she will go to the sacrifice to disrupt it. Śiva is not pleased to hear this and forbids her to attend the sacrifice. Satī is unable to change Śiva’s mind and eventually loses her temper. First she assumes a dreadful form,6 and then she multiplies herself into ten forms, the Mahāvidyās: Kālī, Tārā, Chinnamastā, Bhuvaneśvarī, Bagalā, Dhūmāvatī, Kamalā, Mātaṅgī, Ṣoḍaśī, and Bhairavī.7

The ten forms that Satī takes are not consistently described, and some of the forms, such as Kālī and Tārā, have several manifestations. The following descriptions, however, are typical of the way in which each of the forms is described.

Kalī has a fierce countenance, is naked, dwells in the cremation ground, holds a severed head and a bloodied cleaver, has disheveled hair, and sports a garland of decapitated heads and a girdle of severed arms.8

When Tārā is included in the list of Mahāvidyās, she is described as nearly identical with Kālī. Tārā is dark, rests her left foot on a corpse, wears a tiger skin and a necklace of severed heads, laughs terribly, has her hair in a single matted braid, stands on a funeral pyre, and is pregnant.9

Chinnamastā stands in a cremation ground on the copulating bodies of Kāma and Rati \(sometimes Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa\), the god of sexual lust and his wife. She has decapitated herself with a sword, which she holds in one hand. In her other hand she holds a platter bearing her severed head. Three jets of blood spurt from her neck and stream into the mouths of two female attendants and into the mouth of her own severed head.10

Bhuvaneśvarī is said to nourish the three worlds and is described as holding a piece of fruit in one of her four hands. Her breasts are large and ooze milk. She has a bright, light complexion, smiles pleasantly, and holds a goad and a noose.11

Bagalā has the head of a crane, is seated on a throne of jewels, is yellow, and in one hand holds a club with which she beats an enemy while another of her hands is pulling her enemy’s tongue.12

Dhūmāvatī has a pale complexion, is tall, and has a stern, unsmiling expression. Dressed as a widow, she wears dirty clothes, her hair is disheveled, she has no teeth, her breasts are long and pendulous, she is afflicted with hunger and thirst, her nose is large and crooked, she has a quarrelsome nature, she holds a winnowing fan, and she rides a crow.13

Kamalā is described as a beautiful woman of golden complexion who is surrounded by elephants pouring pitchers of water over her. She is seated on a lotus and holds two lotuses in her hands. She is in most respects portrayed like the goddess Lakśmī, one of whose epithets, in fact, is Kamalā.14

Mātaṅgī is black. Her eyes roll in intoxication, and she reels about like an impassioned elephant.15

Ṣoḍaśī is a girl of sixteen with a red complexion. She is shown astride the prone body of Śiva, with whom she is having intercourse. They are on a pedestal made of the gods Brahmā, Viṣṇu, Rudra, and Indra. Ṣoḍaśī is identified with Tripurasundarī in some lists of the Mahāvidyās.16

Bhairavī \(also known as Tripura Bhairavī\) has a reddish complexion and wears a garland of severed heads, holds a rosary and a book in two of her four hands, and makes the signs of fearlessness and conferring boons with her other two hands. Her breasts are smeared with blood.17 In the *Kālikā-purāṇa* Tripura Bhairavī is said to have eyes that roll from intoxication and to stand on a corpse \(74.90–94\).

Śiva is frightened by Satī’s fearful appearance and the terrible forms that she has assumed, which completely surround him. He gives her permission to go to her father’s sacrifice if she will withdraw them. In the *Mahābhāgavata-purāṇa* account Satī takes the form of Kālī, goes to her father’s sacrifice, and then kills herself. In this account Dakṣa is said to weep at the sight of his daughter in the form of Kālī, who is dark, naked, and disheveled \(8–9\). In the Madhya-khanda of the *Bṛhaddharma-purāṇa* Satī assumes her own benign form before going to the sacrifice \(6–7\).

The mythological context of the appearance of the Mahāvidyās makes it clear that they are meant to be fearsome deities. Even though a few of the goddesses who belong to this group are described as beautiful and unthreatening, for the most part they are formidable and fearsome. Furthermore, the fearsomeness of the goddesses does not seem to be related to upholding the cosmic order.18 They are not described as warriors, and the goddesses mentioned \(with the exception of Kālī\) are not known for playing the roles of warriors. In this respect the Mahāvidyās are not mere feminine versions of the Vaiṣṇava *avatarās*, most of whom appear precisely to defeat demons who threaten the world. In no clear way are the Mahāvidyās said to play the role of guardians of cosmic order. Their primary function in the myth is to frighten Śiva so that Satī may have her own way. The emphasis is on their terrible appearance, which causes Śiva to tremble and attempt to flee.

The Mahāvidyās also play the role of asserting Satī’s power as greater than that of Śiva. In the context of the myth he is simply no match for her. By means of the Mahāvidyās she overpowers him. It is difficult to escape the conclusion that the authors of these myths were trying, at least in part, to assert the superiority of the Devī over Śiva \(and by implication other male gods as well\). Although the Devī plays the part of the gracious, submissive wife in her form as Satī, willingly submitting herself to her husband Śiva, she contains fearsome, independent aspects that easily overwhelm Śiva when they do appear. Satī’s transformation into a dreadful form, and then into several dreadful forms, dramatically alters the traditional myth of Satī, in which she remains loyal and subordinate to Śiva throughout her life. These late versions of the myth show Satī exerting her will over Śiva, scaring him into submission when he resists her.

The fearsomeness of these goddesses also seems to be related to the context in which they are propitiated. Most of these deities are known primarily in Tantric literature; even the goddess Kālī, who is well known outside Tantrism, plays an important part in Tantric texts and practices. In the *Bṛhaddharma-purāṇa* Satī in her dreadful form commands Śiva to give mantras and instructions for worshiping the Mahāvidyās.19 In both that account and the *Mahābhāgavata-purāṇa* Satī announces that she has appeared in these dreadful forms so that her devotees not only may achieve ultimate release \(*mokṣa*\) but may achieve desires and invoke magical powers over others. Both texts specifically mention *mārana*, rituals causing the destruction of enemies; *uccāṭaṇa*, rituals causing a person to stop what he is doing; *kṣobhaṇa*, rituals causing shaking and emotional disturbance; *mohana*, rituals causing infatuation, loss of consciousness, or delusion; *drāvaṇa*, rituals causing people to flee; *jṛmbhaṇa*, rituals causing people to yawn or become slack; and *stambhana*, rituals causing people to become paralyzed.20 The specific powers are not related to specific goddesses in the texts; it seems that these powers are associated with the goddesses’ fearsome aspects and terrifying powers in general. Just as the appearance of the Mahāvidyās causes Śiva to be overcome by these various emotions, so these goddesses will subdue, defeat, or terrify the enemies of the adept or devotee who invokes them.

Although the Mahāvidyās act primarily as a group in the Purāṇic myths, terrifying Śiva together, three of the Mahāvidyās are important individually: Kālī”, Tārā, and Chinnamastā. Kālī, who is almost always mentioned first in lists of the Mahāvidyās, has an ancient history in the Hindu tradition and is an important goddess in many parts of India. Her association with the Mahāvidyās, particularly as the first in the list of ten, sets the tone for the rest of the goddesses, who for the most part are fearsome beings. Kālī’s appearance in this myth is typical of her appearance elsewhere. She appears as Satī’s personified wrath, just as in other myths she appears as the personified wrath of goddesses such as Durgā and Pārvatī.21

## TĀRĀ

The goddess Tārā does not figure prominently in the Hindu tradition. Her place in Tibetan Buddhism, however, is central and quite ancient. Her appearance in the list of the Mahāvidyās can probably be explained, at least in part, by the religious communication that existed for centuries between Tibet and Bengal \(where the texts that mention the Mahāvidyās were written\). Many important Buddhist missionaries to Tibet came from Bengal, and Buddhists continued to be mentioned in Bengali texts until the sixteenth century.22 In the late medieval period, when such texts as the *Mahābhāgavata-purāṇa* and the *Bṛhaddharma-purāṇa* were written, Tārā was probably fairly well known in Bengal. Rāmprasād Sen, the eighteenth-century Bengali devotee of Kālī, often used the name Tārā as an epithet of Kālī, and it seems clear that for him the two goddesses were more or less the same and that he understood Tara to be as much a Hindu goddess as a Buddhist goddess.

The earliest reference to Tārā is found in Subandhu’s *Vasavadattā*, which was probably written around the middle of the seventh century. The reference occurs as part of a pun and situates Tārā in the context of Buddhist devotion. The passage reads: “The Lady Twilight was seen, devoted to the stars and clad in red sky, as a Buddhist nun \(is devoted to Tārā and is clad in red garments\).”23 In Buddhist Tantric mythology Tārā belongs to the family of the Dhyāni Buddha Amoghasiddhi, but she is also related to the bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara, who is in the family of the Dhyāni Buddha Amitābha. In one account all the creatures lament the thought of Avalokiteśvara’s abandoning them as he is about to achieve *nirvāṇa*. Hearing them, Avalokiteśvara sheds a tear of compassion for all beings. That tear becomes Tara, who is thus understood to be the essence of the essence of compassion.24 As we shall see, Tārā’s essential nature in Tibetan Buddhism is that of a compassionate savior who rescues her devotees from peril. Her inclusion in the Amitābha family therefore seems fitting, since both Amitābha and Avalokiteśvara are renowned for their great compassion.

Tibetan Buddhists know other legendary or mythological accounts of Tārā’s origin. One legend identified Tārā with the wives of the first great Tibetan king, Songsten gampo \(A.D. 617–650\). The king himself is said to have been an incarnation of Avalokiteśvara, while his Chinese wife is said to have been an incarnation of Green Tārā and his Nepalese wife an incarnation of White Tārā \(there are several different forms of Tārā, as we shall see\).25 Another Tibetan legend says that the Tibetan people arose from the union of a monkey and a rock ogress. This legend is ancient and pre-Buddhist in origin. By the fourteenth century, when Buddhism had come to dominate Tibet, however, the monkey had come to be identified with Avalokiteśvara and the rock ogress, despite her lustful nature, with an incarnation of the goddess Tārā.26 What is interesting about these Tibetan legends is that they associate Tārā with the origins of the Tibetan people and the Tibetan royal line. They affirm that Tārā is dear to the Tibetan people in a special way. She is in a historical or legendary sense their queen and mother.27

Historically, the cult of Tārā in Tibetan Buddhism dates to the eighth century, that is, to around the time when Buddhism was introduced to Tibet from India. Until the time of Atīśa \(eleventh century\), however, the worship of Tārā does not seem to have been very widespread in Tibet. Atīśa is traditionally associated with bringing the cult of Tārā to Tibet, and biographical accounts emphasize his many visions of Tārā and his special devotion to her. Atīśa is credited with having translated a series of Sanskrit texts concerning Tārā into Tibetan. The texts were soon circulated as a coherent cycle and came to be known by the name *Cheating Death.28* Another text that was to become very popular in Tibet was also brought there in the eleventh century. The master Darmadra brought to Tibet and translated the text *Homages to the Twenty-one Tārās*, which to this day is well known to most Tibetans.29

Despite Tārā’s many forms and functions it seems clear wherein lies her extraordinary power and appeal. She is approached primarily as a savior, as a being who specializes in spectacular, dramatic appearances when her devotees call on her in dire circumstances. Like Durgā,30 Tārā is often said to rescue her devotees from such desperate predicaments as being lost in an impenetrable forest, foundering in a storm at sea, being under threat of imminent execution, or being trapped and bound in prison.31 The many folk stories about Tārā show her typically appearing at the request of her devotees to dramatically rescue them from the jaws of certain death.32 Tārā’s compassion for suffering beings, then, is revealed primarily in her role as the cheater of death. In this sense her chief blessing to her devotees is a long life, and other stories emphasize that regular worship of Tārā brings about longevity.33 In Tibetan monastic traditions, when novices are initiated into the ceremonies in honor of Tārā, the rituals are referred to as an “initiation into life.”34 Unlike goddesses who are associated with life as embodiments of fertility, Tārā is approached primarily as the one who protects, preserves, and saves life. She is not a fertility goddess \(although she does give her blessing in this form from time to time\)35 but a greatly compassionate being who cannot tolerate the suffering of her devotees.

Tārā’s devotees approach her with great love and devotion. Tibetan Tantric Buddhism is in many respects a heroic, fierce religion involving arduous spiritual exercises. Her worship introduces into it a theme of great tenderness. An example of this devotional tenderness is the poem the *Cry of Suffering to Tārā* by the lama Lozang tenpe jets’en:



From my heart I bow to the Holy Lady, essence of compassion,

. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

until I gain the terrace of enlightenment

I pray you grasp me with the iron hook of your compassion.



From the depths of my inmost heart and bones I pray to you

. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

think of me a little, show me your smiling face,

loving one\! grant me the nectar of your voice.

. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

O holy Tārā\! you know

everything that I have done,

my happiness and suffering, my good and evil:

then think lovingly of me, my only mother\!36

Tārā’s charm and approachability are evident in her appearance and personality. Although she is often depicted in regal attire, she is usually said to be a girl of sixteen or younger. She is playful, energetic, and possesses a sense of humor. A modern story about her appearance to a young Tibetan couple whom she rescued from starvation describes her as follows:

Presently a bright light fell upon his eyes and, starting up in alarm, he beheld Tara seated negligently on the table, swinging her legs like a child with more energy than she knew what to do with. However, even as he lept up to prostrate himself, her body began to glow with light. The window behind her was dissolved in these rays and, in its place, he saw the peak of a lofty hill covered with lush green grass wherein glittered innumerable points of light as though it were bestrewn with gems. Beyond and stretching to the horizon was an expanse of deep blue water capped by magnificent white waves which, breaking on the shore below, emitted rainbow-colored clouds of spray. These clouds, rising to the hilltop, filled the air with millions upon millions of glittering particles like multi-coloured jewels. Meanwhile, the table had become a moon disc resting on a huge and many-petalled lotus, whereon Tara sat, still negligently and with the air of a young girl having fun, but now clad in shining silks and golden ornaments like the daughter of the Emperor of the Sky. She was smiling at him with a mixture of archness and contempt.37

Although Tārā’s primary appeal seems to be as the cheater of death, the prolonger of life, and although she is primarily popular as a charming, playful young girl, she does have a variety of forms, some of which are fierce, even terrifying. The *Homages to the Twenty-one Tārās*, probably her most popular hymn of praise, contains several verses that invoke Tārā in fierce forms.





Homage, Lady who annihilates the heroes of Māra,

TURE, the terrible lady,

slaying all enemies

by frowning the brows of her lotus face.

. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Homage, Lady who strikes the earth with her hand,

who pounds upon it with her feet,

shattering the seven underworlds

with the sound of HŪṂ made by her frowning brows.

. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Homage, Lady who strikes with the feet of TURE,

whose seed is the form of the syllable HŪṂ,

shaking Mount Meru, Mandāra, Kailāśa,

and all the triple world.38



Tārā. Eleventh century A.D. Pratapaditya Pal, *Nepal, Where the Gods are Young* \(New York: Asia Society, 1975\), fig. 37, p. 55. Reprinted by permission of William H. Wolff.

A particularly fierce form of Tārā is Tārā Kurukullā.39 She is described as follows:



Homage and praise to her

who stands in the dancing pose

haughty with furious rage,

who has a diadem of five skulls,

who bears a tiger’s skin.

I pay homage to the red one,

bearing her fangs, whose body is frightful,

who is adorned with the five signs of ferocity,

whose necklace is half a hundred human heads,

who is the conqueress of Māra.’40

Tārā Kurukullā’s special power lies in her ability to subjugate and destroy evil spirits or one’s personal enemies.41 The rituals in which Kurukullā is invoked involve the goddess’s coming to reside in the practitioner himself. The rituals thus require a strong and accomplished adept, for Kurukullā is a potent force. The adept dresses in red garments and visualizes himself taking on the form of the goddess. Then he recites her mantra ten thousand times. Then he makes certain offerings to her and asks her to subjugate the person or demon who is the object of the rituals.



When these preliminaries are complete, when he has firmly grasped the vivid appearance and ego of the goddess, the visualization is ready to be performed. Light radiates forth from a HRĪḤ in the practitioner’s heart and places the person to be subjugated, naked and with unbound hair, upon a wind mandala arisen from YAṂ: that is, the seed of wind transforms into the round shape symbolic of the air element, and this wind propels forward the person to be subjugated; he is bound around the neck by a noose radiated from the practitioner’s—Kurukullā’s—lotus flower, drawn forward by an iron hook stuck into his heart, summoned by the strength of the mantra, and laid down helpless upon his back before the practitioner’s feet. If the person to be subjugated is male, the text adds, Kurukullā’s iron hook is stuck into his heart; if female it is stuck into her vagina.42

Other fierce forms of Tārā include Mahāmāyā-vijayavāhinī Tārā,43 Bhīmadevī, who is also called the blue she-wolf,44 and Mahācinatārā. Mahācinatārā \(also known as Ugratārā\) is described in both Buddhist and Hindu sources. She is described in the Buddhist work *Sādhanamālā*.



The worshiper should conceive himself as \(Māhacina-Tārā\) who stands in the Pratyālīḍha attitude, and is awe-inspiring with a garland of heads hanging from the neck. She is short and has a protruding belly, and her looks are terrible. Her complexion is like that of the blue lotus, and she is three-eyed, one-faced, celestial and laughs horribly. She is in an intensely pleasant mood, stands on a corpse, is decked in ornaments of snakes, has red and round eyes, wears the garments of tiger-skin round her loins, is in youthful bloom, is endowed with the five auspicious symbols, and has a protruding tongue. She is most terrible, appears fierce, with bare canine fangs, carries the sword and the Kartri in the two right hands and the Utpala and Kapāla in the two left. Her Jaṭāmukuṭa of one coil is brown and fiery and bears the image of Akṣobhya within it.45

An almost identical description of Mahācinatārā is given in the *Tantra-sāra* of Kṛṣṇananda Āgamavāgīśa, a seventeenth-century compilation of *dhyāna-mantras* written in Bengal. Even though it is a Hindu work, the *Tantrasāra* description includes the reference to an image of Akṣobhya adorning her crown.46

Several other Hindu Tantric texts describe Tārā as fierce, and the goddess’s appearance in these texts differs only in a few particulars from Kālī’s. Such works as the *Tārārahasyavṛttikā*, the *Rudra-yāmala*, and the *Tārā-tantra* describe Tārā as “short of stature, bedecked with ornaments of serpents of various colour, bearing garlands composed of fifty human heads, severed afresh from bodies, and bleeding freely. The *devi* stands with one foot on a dead body . . . in the funeral ground.”47 Completing Tārā’s fierce description in the *Tārā-tantra*, in which barely any resemblance to the benign Tārā of Tibet remains, is her delight in receiving both the blood of sacrificial animals and the blood of her devotees. The devotees’ blood, which is to be taken from specified parts of the body such as the forehead, hands, breast, head, or area between the eyebrows, is said to be far more pleasing to the goddess than the blood of an animal victim \(5.15\). Throughout the text Tārā is to be worshiped in the context of left-handed Tantric rites, in which wine, meat, and illicit sex play an important role.

Tārā’s association with Kālī in the devotional works of Ramprasād Sen also makes it clear that the Tārā known in Hindu Bengal was a fierce goddess quite different from the gentle, youthful, playful forms of Tārā so popular in Tibet. I have a contemporary lithograph of the Mahāvidyās that shows Kālī and Tārā adjacent to each other and almost identical in appearance. Both are dark, nearly naked, have protruding tongues, hold bloodied cleavers in the upper left hand, have a garland of severed heads \(the heads of Kālī’s garland are freshly cut, while the heads of Tārā’s garland are skulls\), have disheveled hair, and stand or dance on an identical prone male body \(or corpse\). Tārā’s inclusion in the list of Mahāvidyās thus does not seem to derive from her essential popularity in Tibetan Buddhism as a gentle, compassionate deity who cheats death. The Hindu Mahāvidyā Tārā is modeled on Tārā’s fierce forms such as Kurukullā and Mahācinatārā.

The Hindu Mahāvidyā Tārā’s association with ceremonies that terrify, disable, stultify, and enchant people48 immediately brings to mind Tārā Kurukullā’s employment in rituals of subjugation in Tibetan Buddhism. Although the ritual context of worship of the Hindu Mahāvidyās is not clear, it may well be that these fierce goddesses are utilized in rituals similar to the ones featuring the fierce Tārā Kurukullā in Tibet. One of the underlying assumptions of the Tārā Kurukullā rituals of subjugation seems to be that if one wishes to exert power over another person, or if one wishes to protect oneself from supernatural beings, the most effective kind of deity one can employ is fierce and terrifying. Such beings as Tārā Kurukullā, it seems, dramatically express the aggressive emotions that must accompany rituals of subjugation and also reassure the person seeking protection from equally fierce, hostile demons.

In any case, the effect of the appearance of the Mahāvidyās on the great god Śiva is impressive. He is terrified and immediately agrees to what Satī wishes. He is subjugated by these goddesses in the same way that Tārā Kurukullā subjugates enemies when properly invoked.

## CHINNAMASTĀ

Chinnamastā, like Tārā, is also popular in Tantric and Tibetan Buddhism. In Buddhism she is known as Vajrayoginī. The Buddhist Tantric text, the *Sadhanamālā*, describes her as follows:



Vajrayoginī . . . carries in her left hand her own head severed by herself with her own Kartri held in her right hand. Her left hand is raised upwards while the right is placed below. She is nude, and her right leg is stretched while the left is bent down. He \(the worshipper\) should also meditate on the streams of blood issuing from the severed body as falling into the mouth of the severed head and into the mouths of the two Yoginīs on either side of her.

He \(the worshipper\) should also conceive the two Yoginīs to the left and right . . . , both of whom carry the Kartri in their left and right hands respectively. . . . Their left and right legs respectively are stretched forward, while the other legs are bent, and they have disheveled hair. On all sides, between the two Yoginīs and in the firmament there is the awful cremation ground.49

The Hindu deity Chinnamastā is similarly depicted. In most Hindu renditions three jets of blood spurt from the cut stump of her neck. One jet streams into the goddess’s own mouth, while the other two flow into the mouths of the two flanking *yoginīs*. The goddess usually holds her own head on a platter, as if about to make an offering of it. Beneath the goddess the god Kāma, personifying sexual desire, and his wife, Rati, are engaged in sexual intercourse, she usually on top. They are stretched out on a lotus, and the backdrop is often a cremation ground.50

Chinnamastā is probably the most dramatic, stunning representation in the Hindu pantheon of the truth that life, sex, and death are part of an interdependent, unified system. The stark contrasts and reversals of what one would normally expect to see in this iconographic scenario—the gruesome decapitation, the copulating couple, the cremation ground, all arranged in a quite delicate, harmonious pattern—jolt the viewer into an awareness of the truth that life feeds on death, is nourished by death, necessitates death, and that the ultimate destiny of sex is to perpetuate more life, which in turn will decay and die in order to feed more life. As arranged in most renditions, the lotus and the copulating couple appear to provide a powerful life force for the goddess, who is standing on the back of the copulating woman. The couple, vigorously participating in the ultimate act of affirming life, convey a strong, insistent, vital urge to the goddess. They pump her with energy, as it were. And at the top, like an overflowing fountain, her blood spurts from her severed neck, the life force leaving her, but streaming into the mouths of her devotees \(and into her own mouth\) to nourish and sustain them.51 The cycle is starkly portrayed: life \(the lovemaking couple\), death \(the decapitated goddess\), and nourishment \(the flanking *yoginīs* drinking her blood\).

The images of most fierce goddesses, such as Kālī, show the goddess severing the heads of others and demanding their blood as nourishment. The practice of sacrificing one’s head to a goddess, usually Durgā or Kālī,52 is also often attested in Indian literature and art. The message \(or at least one of the messages\) is that the goddess, representing the vital forces of the cosmos, needs regular nourishment; sacrificing oneself to her is a way of acknowledging that one is obliged to give life back to her because one has received life from her. These images convey the truth that the goddess is ever hungry and demands blood in order to remain satisfied.



Chinnamastā. Contemporary. First published in *L’Art du Mithila* \(Paris: Les Presses de la Connaissance/Editions sous le Vent, 1985\). Reprinted by permission of Editions sous le Vent.

The Chinnamastā image reverses these images but ultimately teaches the same truth. Chinnamastā is shown not taking or receiving the heads or blood of others but taking her own head and drinking her own blood. She is shown being nourished or sustained not by death \(or sacrifice\) but by the copulating couple beneath her. She is shown not being fed by her devotees but feeding them with her blood. Chinnamastā, however, does not teach different truths from those conveyed by Kālī and Durgā. She simply represents the alternate phase of an ever-recurring sequence. The cosmic process, the rhythms of creation and destruction, the universal economy, is a harmonious alternation of giving and taking, of life and death. Kālī’s need for blood, or conversely the ever-fecund, ever-bountiful giving of goddesses such as Annapūrṇā or śatākṣī, represents only one aspect of the process of giving and taking. Chinnamastā, in her shocking way, presents both aspects together and in such a way that the viewer can grasp the interconnectedness of the different stages in the process. Chinnamastā takes life and vigor from the copulating couple, then gives it away lavishly by cutting off her own head to feed her devotees. Such is the way of things in a world where life must be sustained by organic matter, where metabolism is maintained only by ingesting the corpses of other beings.

The image of Chinnamastā, like the formula of the ten Mahāvidyās itself, does not seem to be very old. The *Sādhanamālā*, containing a description of the headless Vajrayoginī, probably dates to not much later than the twelfth century, and mention of the Hindu ten Mahāvidyās is even more recent than that.53 It has been suggested, however, that Chinnamastā may have earlier prototypes in India.54 Several examples have been discovered in India of nude goddesses squatting or with their thighs spread to display their sexual organs. These figures, some very ancient, often have their arms raised above their bodies and are headless or faceless. Their headless condition is not the result of subsequent damage but an intentional part of the image. The combination of nudity and headlessness, it has been suggested, suffices to indicate that the Chinnamastā figure may have some roots in this more ancient figure.55

These early nude figures, however, are particularly one-sided in what they convey. The arresting iconographic feature of these images is their sexual organs, which are openly displayed. If the headlessness of the figures suggests death, it lacks the force of the Chinnamastā icon. More likely, the headlessness of the nude figures simply focuses attention on their physiology. Although the Chinnamastā image includes an emphasis on sexual vigor, life, and nourishment, the central theme is the shocking self-decapitation.

Other nude goddess figures have been suggested as possible prototypes of Chinnamastā. One of these is the fierce, disheveled goddess Koṭavī. Koṭavī is usually associated with battlefields and is sometimes included among lists of the Mātṛkās.56 She sometimes is an opponent of Viṣṇu, and in the *Viṣṇu-purāṇa* \(5.32–33\) and *Bhāgavata-purāṇa* \(10.63.20\) she is described as naked, disheveled, and of such an awful appearance that Viṣṇu has to turn his head away from her lest he become incensed by her. In this myth she tries to protect the demon Bānāsura, who is her son in the *Bhāgavata-purāṇa* account. Although descriptions of Koṭavī emphasize her nudity and her wild appearance, she seems very different in character from Chinnamastā. Her typical haunt is the battlefield, not the cremation ground \(although both are places of death\), and she seems to be a fierce demoness whose primary role is to terrify or distract enemies during battle. Her character is usually malevolent, while Chinnamastā’s character, although fierce perhaps, is not said to be malevolent.

A South Indian hunting goddess called Koṟṟavai is similar in name and character to Koṭavī. She is fierce, bloodthirsty, and wild. Again, it has been suggested that she may be another expression of the type of goddess that inspired Chinnamastā.57 J. N. Tiwari sums up her nature.



. . . Koṟṟavai was perhaps the earliest and the most widely worshipped goddess of the ancient Dravidian people. She was essentially a goddess of the semi-nomadic hunting tribes of South India who invoked her for success in cattle-raids and appeased her with bloody sacrifices. As presented in the Tamil heroic poems, there is no marked element of fertility in the character of Koṟṟavai, who remains primarily a goddess of war and victory.58

The Chinnamastā image is striking primarily because her self-decapitation rivets the viewer’s attention. She is not a warrior goddess, and unlike Koṟṟavai she does not receive blood sacrifices; rather, she gives her own blood to her devotees. Although Tiwari is to be commended for drawing our attention to the nude, squatting goddesses and to the naked, fierce goddesses Koṭavī and Koṟṟavai, for each of whom he gives a thorough description from many and differing sources, none of the figures seems to be overwhelmingly similar to Chinnamastā. There are many goddesses and demonesses in the Hindu tradition who haunt battlefields, are nude, are fierce and bloodthirsty in nature, or have a clear association with fertility. Chinnamastā, however, seems to be the only goddess who decapitates herself in order to nourish her devotees.

Although Chinnamastā is easily recognized by most Hindus and although her image, along with the other Mahāvidyās, is fairly common in goddess temples, she is not popularly worshiped by most Hindus. She is almost always associated with heroic, Tantric religious practice. The only temple dedicated to Chinnamastā that I have been able to locate is in the courtyard of a large Durgā temple in Rāmnagar across the Ganges River from Banaras. The priests at the Durgā temple told me that the temple had been established by a Tantric *sādhu* and that the people who worshiped the image were primarily Tantrics in pursuit of *siddhis* or supernatural powers.
