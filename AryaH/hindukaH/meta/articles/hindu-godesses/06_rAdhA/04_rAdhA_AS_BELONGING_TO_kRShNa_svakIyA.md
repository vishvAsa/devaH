title = "04 RĀDHĀ AS BELONGING TO KṚṢṆA \\(SVAKĪYĀ\\)"

+++

Although Rādhā’s position as Kṛṣṇa’s legal, divine consort never became very popular in Kṛṣṇa devotional movements, there is a sustained rendition of Kṛṣṇa mythology in which Rādhā is cast in this role. The *Brahma-vaivarta-purāṇa* assumes Rādhā’s status as a goddess.25 She is inextricably associated with Kṛṣṇa philosophically as his *śakti,* as his underlying power or that dimension of himself that empowers him, indeed, enables him, to create the world and display himself in his various forms. Several passages compare Rādhā to Kṛṣṇa in such a way that her status is affirmed to be comparable, equal, or even superior to his own. For example, a familiar analogy likens Rādhā to the clay with which Kṛṣṇa, the potter, creates the world.26 She is identified with *prakṛti,* the primordial matter or substance of creation; Kṛṣṇa is identified with *puruṣa,* the spiritual essence of reality that stirs *prakṛti* to evolve into various forms. Elsewhere the two are identified on the analogy of attribute and substance. Kṛṣṇa says to Rādhā:



As you are, so am I; there is certainly no difference  
between us.

As whiteness inheres in milk, as burning in fire,  
my fair Lady,

As smell in earth, so do I inhere in you always.27

Another passage describes the two as initially forming an androgynous figure, of which Kṛṣṇa is one half and Rādhā the other. Rādhā says to Kṛṣṇa:



I have been constructed by someone out of half your body;

Therefore there is no difference between us, and my  
heart is in you.

Just as my Self \(Ātman\), heart, and life has been placed  
in you,

So has your Self, heart, and life been placed in me.28

The text elevates Rādhā to such an extent that in several places it states that she is superior in status to Kṛṣṇa himself. In one passage, for example, Kṛṣṇa is speaking to Rādhā and says that all things in the universe have some kind of support, that without some kind of support they could not exist. His support, he concludes, is Rādhā, upon whom he rests eternally.29 She alone, by implication, has no support and as such is the supreme reality. In another place Kṛṣṇa likens Rādhā to his *ātman:* “You are my life; I am dead without you.”30 In another passage Rādhā is called mother of the world and Kṛṣṇa father of the world. The mother, however, is declared to be the guru of the father and as such is said to be worshiped as supreme.31

Rādhā’s elevated status, her role as cosmic queen equal to or superior to Kṛṣṇa, gives her a central role in the cosmogony in the *Brahma-vaivarta-purāṇa.* In one version of creation Kṛṣṇa desires to create and so divides himself into two, male and female. The two undertake sexual intercourse for a long time, during which his sighs and the sweat from her body create the winds and primordial oceans. Eventually he ejaculates into her; after bearing his seed for many years, she gives birth to a golden egg, the universe itself. The egg floats in the cosmic waters for a long time, then splits, and the god Viṣṇu is born; he in turn creates innumerable worlds.32 As creator of the universe we find Rādhā playing a role that is extremely atypical of her earlier history, namely, the role of mother. Nowhere in earlier literature is Rādhā a mother. In the *Brahma-vaivarta-purāṇa,* however, she is often called by names that suggest her motherly role vis-à-vis the created world. She is called mother of Visnu \(Mahāviṣṇormātṛ, Mahāviṣṇudhātrī\), mother of the world \(Jaganmātr, Jagadambikā\), and mother of all \(Sarvamātr\).33

Rādhā’s personal relationship to Kṛṣṇa has also undergone significant changes in this text. In earlier literature her relationship to him was consistently described as nonpossessive and was characterized by love in separation. These qualities stemmed in good measure from the illicit nature of their love, in which neither could exert legal or formal controls over the other. As a woman married to another man, Rādhā owed Kṛṣṇa nothing. In the *Brahma-vaivarta-purāṇa,* however, in which the two are understood to be eternally related to each other as husband and wife \(or as god and goddess\), Rādhā’s love takes on a possessive quality. As the queen of the cosmos, as consort of the great god Kṛṣṇa, she is described as surrounded and worshiped by millions of cowherd devotees and as acting the part of the chaste and jealous wife of Kṛṣṇa. At several points in the text Rādhā discovers Kṛṣṇa dallying with other women. Her reaction is always the same: she is outraged, jealous, and vengeful. She terrifies Kṛṣṇa in her rage and curses her rivals to miserable fates. In one case a woman named Virājā is so scared of Rādhā’s wrath that she commits suicide.34 Rādhā’s love is described in many episodes as cruel, selfish, and demanding. In several cases she nags Kṛṣṇa about which consort he loves best and is only contented when he flatters her.35 In contrast to earlier descriptions of her love for Kṛṣṇa, in the *Brahma-vaivarta-purāṇa* she is a selfish, vindictive, and insecure wife who makes life miserable for Kṛṣṇa, herself, and the other women of heavenly Vraja. If Rādhā has gained metaphysical promotion in the *Brahma-vaivarta-purāṇa,* it seems to have been at the expense of losing her intrinsic appeal as the lovesick girl of Vraja, who is unable to make any claims on her lover. The Rādhā of the *Brahma-vaivarta-purana* has lost her innocence, her intensity, and a considerable part of her charm.

Nevertheless, although most Kṛṣṇa devotional movements rejected this portrait of Rādhā as *svakīyā* \(the text is undoubtedly quite late, dating from the fifteenth or sixteenth century\), a few small groups revere Rādhā in her role as cosmic queen. Both the Rādhāvallabhins and the Sakhībhavas, movements that arose sometime during the sixteenth century in and around Brindaban in North India, place Rādhā in a position similar to her position in the *Brahma-vaivarta-purāṇa.* The Rādhāvallabhins in their actual devotion concentrate on Rādhā more than on Kṛṣṇa. The Sakhībhavas express their piety by concentrating on becoming servants or friends of Rādhā. In their rituals they dress like women and express their devotion by doting on Rādhā and serving her in every way. The attitude of these movements is nicely expressed in the words of one of their members: “Krishna is the servant of Rādhā. He may do the coolie-work of building the world, but Rādhā sits as Queen. He is at best but her Secretary of State. We win the favor of Krishna by worshipping Rādhā.”36
