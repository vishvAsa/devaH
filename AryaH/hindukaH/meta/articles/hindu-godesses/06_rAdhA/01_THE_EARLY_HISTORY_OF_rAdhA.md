title = "01 THE EARLY HISTORY OF RĀDHĀ"

+++

Rādhā does not appear as a fully developed figure until quite late in the Hindu tradition. Prior to Jayadeva’s *Gītagovinda* \(twelfth century\) she is mentioned in only a few brief references.2 The *Padma-, Brahmavaivarta-,* and *Devī-bhāgavata-purāṇas,* which describe her affair with Kṛṣṇa in detail, are all considered late. Although the early references are few and although they never supply lengthy descriptions of Rādhā, her character is nevertheless clearly suggested.

In these passages Rādhā is a lovesick girl or woman who is overcome by her emotions. The *Veṇīsaṁhāra* of Bhaṭṭa Nārāyaṇa \(antedates A.D. 800\) describes Rādhā as being angered while making love to Kṛṣṇa and as leaving him while choking on her tears.3 In the *Dhvanyalokālocana* of Abhinavagupta \(early tenth century\) Rādhā weeps pitifully when Kṛṣṇa leaves the village of Vraja for Mathurā, where he begins his adult life.4 She is described in Kṣemendra’s *Daśāvatāracarita* \(1066\) as barely able to speak when Kṛṣṇa leaves for Mathurā.



With tears, flowing away like life in Mādhava’s desertion,

Falling on her breasts’ firm tips, Rādhā was like a laden  
kadamba tree

As tears were strewn by her endless sighing and trembling gait—

Darkened by the delusion that was bound to all her hopes,

She became like the new rainy season engulfed in darkness.5

Although the adulterous aspect of her love is not mentioned explicitly in any of these early references, the centrality of love in separation *\(viraha\)* is clear in almost every one. In later texts it is the illicit nature of Rādhā’s love for Kṛṣṇa that usually necessitates long periods of separation and dictates that she cannot leave with him when he goes away to Mathurā or later to Dv*ā*raka; it is probable that the authors of these earlier passages also understood Rādhā to be married to another man, to be *parakīyā* \(belonging to another\) in her relationship with Kṛṣṇa.

Another characteristic of Rādhā is clear in these early references: she is always associated with Kṛṣṇa. None of the references shows interest in Rādhā per se. It is only her love for Kṛṣṇa, or his love for her, which is mentioned. In several of these texts Kṛṣṇa is as hopelessly impassioned and maddened by love as Rādhā. When he mounts his chariot to leave Vraja he is described in Kṣemendra’s *Daśavātaracarita* as looking longingly for a sight of Rādhā, as being disconsolate, and as sighing unhappily.6 In the *Siddhahemaśabdānuśāna* of Hemacandra \(1088–1172\) we read:



Though Hari sees every person with full regard,

Still his glance goes wherever Rādhā is—

Who can arrest eyes ensnared by love?7

Prior to her appearance as a fully developed heroine in Jayadeva’s *Gītagovinda,* then, Rādhā is known to the Indian literary tradition as a young girl who is passionately in love with Kṛṣṇa; that love is often expressed in terms of separation from him, which suggests an illicit quality to their affair.
