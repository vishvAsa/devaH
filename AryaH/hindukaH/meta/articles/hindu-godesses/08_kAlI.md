+++





The goddess Kālī is almost always described as having a terrible, frightening appearance. She is always black or dark, is usually naked, and has long, disheveled hair. She is adorned with severed arms as a girdle, freshly cut heads as a necklace, children’s corpses as earrings, and serpents as bracelets. She has long, sharp fangs, is often depicted as having clawlike hands with long nails, and is often said to have blood smeared on her lips. Her favorite haunts heighten her fearsome nature. She is usually shown on the battlefield, where she is a furious combatant who gets drunk on the hot blood of her victims, or in a cremation ground, where she sits on a corpse surrounded by jackals and goblins.

Many texts and contexts treat Kālī as an independent deity, unassociated with any male deity. When she is associated with a god, however, it is almost always Śiva. As his consort, wife, or associate, Kālī often plays the role of inciting him to wild behavior. Kālī’s association with Śiva, unlike Pārvatī’s, seems aimed at exciting him to take part in dangerous, destructive behavior that threatens the stability of the cosmos. Kālī is particularly popular in Bengal, although she is known and worshiped throughout India. In Bengal she is worshiped on Dīpāvalī. In this festival, and throughout the year at many of her permanent temples, she receives blood offerings. She is also the recipient of ardent devotion from countless devotees, who approach her as their mother.

## EARLY HISTORY

The earliest references to Kālī in the Hindu tradition date to the early medieval period \(around A.D. 600\) and usually locate Kālī either on the battlefield or in situations on the periphery of Hindu society. In the *Agni-* and *Garuḍa-purāṇas* she is mentioned in invocations that aim at success in war and against one’s enemies. She is described as having an awful appearance: she is gaunt, has fangs, laughs loudly, dances madly, wears a garland of corpses, sits on the back of a ghost, and lives in the cremation ground. She is asked to crush, trample, break, and burn the enemy.1 In the *Bhāgavata-purāṇa* Kālī is the patron deity of a band of thieves whose leader seeks to achieve Kālī’s blessing in order to have a son. The thief kidnaps a saintly Brahman youth with the intention of offering him as a blood sacrifice to Kālī. The effulgence of the virtuous youth, however, burns Kālī herself when he is brought near her image. Emerging from her image, infuriated, she kills the leader and his entire band. She is described as having a dreadful face and large teeth and as laughing loudly. She and her host of demons then decapitate the corpses of the thieves, drink their blood until drunk, and throw their heads about in sport \(5.9.12–20\).

Bāṇabhaṭṭa’s seventh-century drama *Kādambarī* features a goddess named Caṇḍī, an epithet used for both Durgā and Kālī, who is worshiped by the śabaras, a tribe of primitive hunters. The worship takes place deep in the forest, and blood offerings are made to the goddess.2 Vākpati’s *Gauḍavaho* \(late seventh or early eighth century\) portrays Kālī as an aspect of Vindhyavāsinī \(an epithet of Durgā\). She is worshiped by śabaras, is clothed in leaves, and receives human sacrifices \(verses 285–347\).3 In Bhavabhūti’s *Mālatīmādhava,* a drama of the early eighth century, a female devotee of Cāmuṇḍā, a goddess who is very often identified with Kālī, captures the heroine, Mālatī, with the intention of sacrificing her to the goddess. Cāmuṇḍa’s temple is near a cremation ground. A hymn to the goddess describes her as dancing wildly and making the world shake. She has a gaping mouth, wears a garland of skulls, is covered with snakes, showers flames from her eyes that destroy the world, and is surrounded by goblins.4

Somadeva’s *Yaśatilaka* \(eleventh to twelfth century\) contains a long description of a godess called Caṇḍamārī. In all respects she is like Kālī, and we may understand the scenario Somadeva describes as suggestive of Kālī’s appearance and worship at that time. The goddess adorns herself with pieces of human corpses, uses oozings from corpses for cosmetics, bathes in rivers of wine or blood, sports in cremation grounds, and uses human skulls as drinking vessels.5 Bizarre and fanatical devotees gather at her temple and undertake forms of ascetic self-torture. They burn incense on their heads, drink their own blood, and offer their own flesh into the sacrificial fire.6

Kālī’s association with the periphery of Hindu society \(she is worshiped by tribal or low-caste people in uncivilized or wild places\) is also seen in an architectural work of the sixth to eighth centuries, the *Mānasāra-śilpa-śāstra.* There it is said that Kālī’s temples should be built far from villages and towns, near the cremation grounds and the dwellings of Caṇḍālas \(very low-caste people\) \(9.289\).

Kālī’s most famous appearances in battle contexts are found in the *Devī-māhātmya.* In the third episode, which features Durgā’s defeat of śumbha and Niśumbha and their allies, Kālī appears twice. Early in the battle the demons Caṇḍa and Muṇḍa approach Durgā with readied weapons. Seeing them prepared to attack her, Durgā becomes angry, her face becoming dark as ink. Suddenly the goddess Kālī springs from her forehead. She is black, wears a garland of human heads and a tiger skin, and wields a skull-topped staff. She is gaunt, with sunken eyes, gaping mouth, and lolling tongue. She roars loudly and leaps into the battle, where she tears demons apart with her hands and crushes them in her jaws. She grasps the two demon generals and in one furious blow decapitates them both with her sword \(7.3–22\). Later in the battle Kālī is summoned by Durgā to help defeat the demon Raktabīja. This demon has the ability to reproduce himself instantly whenever a drop of his blood falls to the ground. Having wounded Raktabīja with a variety of weapons, Durgā and her assistants, a fierce band of goddesses called the Mātṛkās,7 find they have worsened their situation. As Raktabīja bleeds more and more profusely from his wounds, the battlefield increasingly becomes filled with Raktabīja duplicates. Kālī defeats the demon by sucking the blood from his body and throwing the countless duplicate Raktabījas into her gaping mouth \(8.49–61\)

In these two episodes Kālī appears to represent Durgā’s personified wrath, her embodied fury. Kālī plays a similar role in her association with Pārvatī. In general, Pārvatī is a benign goddess, but from time to time she exhibits fierce aspects. When this occurs, Kālī is sometimes described as being brought into being. In the *Liṅga-purāṇa* Śiva asks Pārvatī to destroy the demon Dāruka, who has been given the boon that he can only be killed by a female. Pārvatī then enters Śiva’s body and transforms herself from the poison that is stored in Śiva’s throat. She reappears as Kālī, ferocious in appearance, and with the help of flesh-eating *piśācas* \(spirits\) attacks and defeats Daruka and his hosts. Kālī, however, becomes so intoxicated by the blood lust of battle that she threatens to destroy the entire world in her fury. The world is saved when Śiva intervenes and calms her \(1.106\). Kālī appears in a similar context elsewhere in the same text. When Śiva sets out to defeat the demons of the three cities, Kālī is part of his entourage. She whirls a trident, is adorned with skulls, has her eyes half-closed by intoxication from drinking the blood of demons, and wears an elephant hide. She is also praised, however, as the daughter of Himalaya, a clear identification with Pārvatī. It seems that in the process of Pārvatī’s preparations for war, Kālī appears as Pārvatī’s personified wrath, her alter ego, as it were \(1.72.66–68\).

The *Vāmana-purāṇa* calls Pārvatī Kālī \(the black one\) because of her dark complexion. Hearing Śiva use this name, Pārvatī takes offense and undertakes austerities in order to rid herself of her dark complexion. After succeeding, she is renamed Gaurī \(the golden one\). Her dark sheath, however, is transformed into the furious battle queen Kauśikī, who subsequently creates Kālī in her fury. So again, although there is an intermediary goddess \(Kauśikī\), Kālī plays the role of Pārvatī’s dark, negative, violent nature in embodied form \(25–29\).

Kālī makes similar appearances in myths concerning both Satī and Sītā. In the case of Satī, Kālī appears when Satī’s father, Dakṣa, infuriates his daughter by not inviting her and Śiva to a great sacrificial rite. Satī rubs her nose in anger and Kālī appears.8 Kālī also appears in other texts when SatI, in her wrath over the same incident, gives birth to or transforms herself into ten goddesses, the *Dasamahāvidyās.* The first goddess mentioned in this group is usually Kālī.9 In the case of Sītā, Kālī appears as her fierce, terrible, bloodthirsty aspect when Rāma, on his return to India after defeating Rāvaṇa, is confronted with such a terrible monster that he freezes in fear. Sītā, transformed into Kālī, handily defeats the demon.10

In her association with Śiva Kālī’s tendency to wildness and disorder persists. Although she is sometimes tamed or softened by him, at times she incites Śiva himself to dangerous, destructive behavior. A South Indian tradition tells of a dance contest between the two. After defeating śumbha and Niśumbha, Kālī takes up residence in a forest with her retinue of fierce companions and terrorizes the surrounding area. A devotee of Śiva in that area becomes distracted from doing austerities and petitions Śiva to rid the forest of the violent goddess. When Śiva appears, Kālī threatens him, claiming the area as her own. Śiva challenges her to a dance contest and defeats her when she is unable \(or unwilling\) to match his energetic *tāṇḍava* dance.11

Although this tradition says that Śiva defeated and forced Kālī to control her disruptive habits, we find few images and myths depicting her becalmed and docile.12 Instead, we find references or images that show Śiva and Kālī in situations where either or both behave in disruptive ways, inciting each other, or in which Kālī in her wild activity dominates an inactive or sometimes dead Śiva.13

In the first type of relationship the two appear dancing together in such a way that they threaten the world. Bhavabhūti’s *Mālatīmādhava* describes the divine pair as they dance wildly near the goddess’s temple. Their dance is so frenzied that it threatens to destroy the world. Pārvatī stands nearby, frightened.14 Here the scenario is not a dance contest but a mutually destructive dance in which the two deities incite each other. This is a common image in Bengali devotional hymns to Kālī. Śiva and Kālī complement each other in their madness and destructive habits.



Crazy is my Father, crazy my Mother,

And I, their son, am crazy too\!

Shyama \[the dark one, an epithet of Kālī\] is my  
Mother’s name.

My Father strikes His cheeks and makes a hollow sound:

*Ba-ba-boom\! Ba-ba-boom\!*

And my Mother, drunk and reeling,

Falls across my Father’s body\!

Shyama’s streaming tresses hang in vast disorder;

Bees are swarming numberless

About her crimson Lotus Feet.

Listen, as She dances, how Her anklets ring\!15

Iconographic representations of Kālī and Śiva nearly always show Kālī as dominant. She is usually standing or dancing on Śiva’s prone body, and when the two are depicted in sexual intercourse, she is shown above him. Although Śiva is said to have tamed Kālī in the myth of the dance contest, it seems clear that she was never finally subdued by him and is most popularly represented as a being who is uncontrollable and more apt to provoke Śiva to dangerous activity than to be controlled by him.

In general, then, we may say that Kālī is a goddess who threatens stability and order. Although she may be said to serve order in her role as slayer of demons, more often than not she becomes so frenzied on the battlefield, usually becoming drunk on the blood of her victims, that she herself begins to destroy the world that she is supposed to protect. Thus even in the service of the gods, she is ultimately dangerous and tends to get out of control. In association with other goddesses, she appears to represent their embodied wrath and fury, a frightening, dangerous dimension of the divine feminine that is released when these goddesses become enraged or are summoned to take part in war and killing. In relation to Śiva, she appears to play the opposite role from that of Pārvatī. Pārvatī calms Śiva, counterbalancing his antisocial or destructive tendencies. It is she who brings Śiva within the sphere of domesticity and who, with her soft glances, urges him to moderate the destructive aspects of his *tāṇḍava* dance.16 Kālī is Śiva’s “other” wife, as it were, provoking him and encouraging him in his mad, antisocial, often disruptive habits. It is never Kālī who tames Śiva but Śiva who must becalm Kālī. Her association with criminals reinforces her dangerous role vis-avis society. She is at home outside the moral order and seems to be unbounded by that order.

## THE LATER HISTORY AND THE SIGNIFICANCE OF KĀLĪ

Given Kālī’s intimidating appearance and ghastly habits, it might seem that she would never occupy a central position in Hindu piety, yet she does. She is of central importance in Tantrism, particularly left-handed Tantrism, and in Bengali Śākta devotionalism. An underlying assumption in Tantric ideology is that reality is the result and expression of the symbiotic interaction of male and female, Śiva and *śakti,* the quiescent and the dynamic, and other polar opposites that in interaction produce a creative tension. Consequently, goddesses in Tantrism play an important role and are affirmed to be as central to discerning the nature of reality as the male deities are. Although Śiva is usually said to be the source of the *Tantras,* the source of wisdom and truth, and Pārvatī, his spouse, to be the student to whom the scriptures are given, many of the *Tantras* emphasize the fact that it is *śakti* that pervades reality with her power, might, and vitality and that it is she \(understood in personified form to be Pārvatī, Kālī, and other goddesses\) who is immediately present to the adept and whose presence and being underlie his own being. For the Tantric adept it is her vitality that is sought through various techniques aimed at spiritual transformation; thus it is she who is affirmed as the dominant and primary reality.

Although Pārvatī is usually said to be the recipient of Śiva’s wisdom in the form of the *Tantras,* it is Kālī who seems to dominate Tantric iconography, texts, and rituals, especially in left-handed Tantra. In many places Kālī is praised as the greatest of all deities or the highest reality. In the *Nirvāṇa-tantra* the gods Brahmā, Viṣṇu, and Śiva are said to arise from her like bubbles from the sea, endlessly arising and passing away, leaving their source unchanged. Compared to Kālī, proclaims this text, Brahmā, Viṣṇu, and Śiva are like the amount of water in a cow’s hoofprint compared to the waters of the sea.17 The *Nigama-kalpataru* and the *Picchilā-tantra* declare that of all mantras Kālī’s is the greatest.18The *Yoginī-tantra,* the *Kāmākhyā-tantra,* and the *Niruttara-tantra* all proclaim Kālī the greatest of the *vidyās* \(the manifestations of the Mahādevī, the “great goddess”\) or divinity itself; indeed, they declare her to be the essence or own form *\(svarūpa\)* of the Mahādevī.19 The *Kāmadā-tantra* states unequivocally that she is attributeless, neither male nor female, sinless, the imperishable *saccidānanda* \(being, consciousness, and bliss\), *brahman* itself.20 In the *Mahānirvāṇa-tantra,* too, Kālī is one of the most common epithets for the primordial *śakti/21* and in one passage Śiva praises her as follows:



At the dissolution of things, it is Kāla \[Time\] Who will devour all, and by reason of this He is called Mahākāla \[an epithet of Śiva\], and since Thou devourest Mahākāla Himself, it is Thou who art the Supreme Primordial Kālika.

Because Thou devourest Kāla, Thou art Kālī, the original form of all things, and because Thou art the Origin of and devourest all things Thou art called the Adyā \[primordial\] Kālī. Resuming after Dissolution Thine own form, dark and formless, Thou alone remainest as One ineffable and inconceivable. Though having a form, yet art Thou formless; though Thyself without beginning, multiform by the power of M*ā*y*ā*, Thou art the Beginning of all, Creatrix, Protectress, and Destructress that Thou art. \(4.30-34\)22

Why Kālī, in preference to other goddesses, attained this preeminent position in Tantrism is not entirely clear. Given certain Tantric ideological and ritual presuppositions, however, the following logic seems possible. Tantrism generally is ritually oriented. By means of various rituals \(exterior and interior, bodily and mental\) the *sādhaka* \(practitioner\) seeks to gain *mokṣa* \(release, salvation\). A consistent theme in this endeavor is the uniting of opposites \(male-female, microcosm-macrocosm, sacred-profane, *Śiva-śakti\).* In Tantrism there is an elaborate, subtle geography of the body that must be learned, controlled, and ultimately resolved in unity. By means of the body, both the physical and subtle bodies, the *sādhaka* may manipulate levels of reality and harness the dynamics of those levels to the attainment of his goal. The *sādhaka,* with the help of a guru, undertakes to gain his goal by conquest—by using his own body and knowledge of that body to bring the fractured world of name and form, the polarized world of male and female, sacred and profane, to wholeness and unity.

*Sādhana* \(spiritual endeavor\) takes a particularly dramatic form in left-handed *\(vāmācāra\)* Tantrism. In his attempt to realize the nature of the world as completely and thoroughly pervaded by the one *śakti,* the *sādhaka* \(here called the “hero,” *vīra\)* undertakes the ritual of the *pañcatattva,* the “five \(forbidden\) things” \(or truths\). In a ritual context and under the supervision of his guru, the *sādhaka* partakes of wine, meat, fish, parched grain \(perhaps a hallucinogenic drug of some kind\), and illicit sexual intercourse. In this way he overcomes the distinction \(or duality\) of clean and unclean, sacred and profane, and breaks his bondage to a world that is artificially fragmented. He affirms in a radical way the underlying unity of the phenomenal world, the identity of *śakti* with the whole creation. Heroically, he triumphs over it, controls and masters it. By affirming the essential worth of the forbidden, he causes the forbidden to lose its power to pollute, to degrade, to bind.23

The figure of Kālī conveys death, destruction, fear, terror, the all-consuming aspect of reality. As such she is also a “forbidden thing,” or the forbidden par excellence, for she is death itself. The Tantric hero does not propitiate, fear, ignore, or avoid the forbidden. During the *pañcatattva* ritual, the *sādhaka* boldly confronts Kālī and thereby assimilates, overcomes, and transforms her into a vehicle of salvation. This is particularly clear in the *Karpūrādi-stotra,* a short work in praise of Kālī, which describes the *pañcatattva* ritual as performed in the cremation ground \(*śmaśāna-sādhana*\). Throughout this text Kālī is described in familiar terms. She is black \(verse 1\), has disheveled hair and blood trickling from her mouth \(3\), holds a sword and a severed head \(4\), wears a girdle of severed arms, sits on a corpse in the cremation ground \(7\), and is surrounded by skulls, bones, and female jackals \(8\). It is she, when confronted boldly in meditation, who gives the *sādhaka* great power and ultimately salvation. In Kālī’s favorite dwelling place, the cremation ground, the *sādhaka* meditates on every terrible aspect of the black goddess and thus achieves his goal.



He, O Mahākalī, who in the cremation-ground, naked, and with dishevelled hair, intently meditates upon Thee and recites Thy *mantra,* and with each recitation makes offering to Thee of a thousand *Akaṇda* flowers with seed, becomes without any effort a Lord of the earth.

O Kālī, whoever on Tuesday at midnight, having uttered Thy *mantra,* makes offering even but once with devotion to Thee of a hair of his *śakti*\[his female companion\] in the cremation-ground, becomes a great poet, a Lord of the earth, and ever goes mounted upon an elephant. \(15–16\)24

The *Karpūrādi-stotra* clearly makes Kālī more than a terrible, ferocious slayer of demons who serves Durgā or Śiva on the battlefield. In fact, she is by and large dissociated from the battle context. She is the supreme mistress of the universe \(12\), she is identified with the five elements \(14\), and in union with Śiva \(who is identified as her spouse\)25 she creates and destroys the worlds. Her appearance has also been modified, befitting her exalted position as ruler of the world and the object of meditation by which the *sādhaka* attains liberation. In addition to her terrible aspects \(which are insisted upon\), there are now hints of another, benign dimension. So, for example, she is no longer described as emaciated or ugly. In the *Karpūrādi-stotra* she is young and beautiful \(1\), has a gently smiling face \(18\), and makes gestures with her two right hands that dispel fear and offer boons \(4\). These positive features are entirely apt, as Kālī no longer is a mere shrew, the distillation of Durgā’s or Pārvatī’s wrath, but is she through whom the hero achieves success, she who grants the boon of salvation, and she who, when boldly approached, frees the *sādhaka* from fear itself. She is here not only the symbol of death but the symbol of triumph over death.

Kālī also attains a central position in late medieval Bengali devotional literature.26 In this devotion Kālī’s appearance and habits have not changed very much. She remains terrifying in appearance and fearsome in habit. She is eminently recognizable. Rāmprasād Sen \(1718-75\), one of her most ardent devotees, describes his beloved Kālī in almost shocked tones:



O Kālī\! why dost Thou roam about nude?

Art Thou not ashamed, Mother\!

Garb and ornaments Thou hast none; yet Thou  
pridest in being King’s daughter.

O Mother\! is it a virtue of Thy family that  
Thou placest thy feet on Thy Husband?

Thou are nude; Thy Husband is nude; you both  
roam cremation grounds.

O Mother\! we are all ashamed of you; do put on  
Thy garb.

Thou hast cast away Thy necklace of Jewells,  
Mother, and worn a garland of human heads.

Prasāda says, “Mother\! Thy fierce beauty has  
frightened Thy nude Consort.”27

The approach of the devotee to Kālī, however, is quite different in mood and temperament from the approach of the Tantric *sādhaka.* The Tantric adept, seeking to view Kālī in her most terrible aspect, is heroic in approach, cultivating an almost aggressive, fearless stance before her. The Tantric adept challenges Kālī to unveil her most forbidding secrets. The devotee, in contrast, adopts the position of the helpless child when approaching Kālī. Even though the child’s mother may be fearsome, at times even hostile, the child has little choice but to return to her for protection, security, and warmth. This is just the attitude Rāmprasād expresses when he writes: “Though she beat it, the child clings to its mother, crying ’Mother.’ ”28

Why Kālī is approached as mother and in what sense she is perceived to be a mother by her devotees are questions that do not have clear or easy answers. In almost every sense Kālī is *not* portrayed as a mother in the Hindu tradition prior to her central role in Bengali devotion beginning in the eighteenth century. Except in some contexts when she is associated or identified with Pārvatī as Śiva’s consort, Kālī is rarely pictured in motherly scenes in Hindu mythology or iconography. Even in Bengali devotion to her, her appearance and habits change very little. Indeed, Kālī’s appearance and habits strike one as conveying truths opposed to those conveyed by such archetypal mother goddesses as Pṛthivī, Annapūrṇa, Jagaddhātrī, śatāksī, and other Hindu goddesses associated with fertility, growth, abundance, and well-being.29These goddesses appear as inexhaustible sources of nourishment and creativity. When depicted iconographically they are heavy hipped and heavy breasted. Kālī, especially in her early history, is often depicted or described as emaciated, lean, and gaunt. It is not her breasts or hips that attract attention. It is her mouth, her lolling tongue, and her bloody cleaver. These other goddesses, “mother goddesses” in the obvious sense, give life. Kālī takes life, insatiably. She lives in the cremation ground, haunts the battlefield, sits upon a corpse, and adorns herself with pieces of corpses. If mother goddesses are described as ever fecund, Kālī is described as ever hungry. Her lolling tongue, grotesquely long and oversized, her sunken stomach, emaciated appearance, and sharp fangs convey a presence that is the direct opposite of a fertile, protective mother goddess. If mother goddesses give life, Kālī feeds on life. What they give, she takes away.

Although the attitude of the devotee to Kālī is different from that of the Tantric hero, although their paths appear very different, the attitude a id approach of the devotee who insists upon approaching Kālī as his mother may reveal a logic similar to that of the Tantric hero’s. The truths about reality that Kālī conveys—namely, that life feeds on death, that death is inevitable for all beings, that time wears all things down, and so on30—are just as apparent to the devotee as they are to the Tantric hero. The fearfulness of these truths, however, is mitigated, indeed is transformed into liberating wisdom, if these truths can be accepted. The Tantric hero seeks to appropriate these truths by confronting Kālī, by seeking her in the cremation ground in the dead of night, and by heroically demonstrating courage equal to her terrible presence. The devotee, in contrast, appropriates the truths Kail reveals by adopting the attitude of a child, whose essential nature toward its mother is that of acceptance, no matter how awful, how indifferent, how fearsome she is. The devotee, then, by making the apparently unlikely assertion that Kālī is his mother, enables himself to approach and appropriate the forbidding truths that Kālī reveals; in appropriating these truths the devotee, like the Tantric adept, is liberated from the fear these truths impose on people who deny or ignore them.

Through devotion to Kālī the devotee becomes reconciled to death and achieves an acceptance of the way things are, an equilibrium that remains unperturbed in Kālī’s presence. These themes are expressed well in this song of Rāmprasād’s:



O Mother\! Thou has great dissolution in Thy hand;  
Śiva lies at Thy feet, absorbed in bliss.

Thou laughest aloud \(striking terror\); streams of  
blood flow from Thy limbs.

O Tārā, doer of good, the good of all, grantor of safety,  
O Mother, grant me safety.

O Mother Kālī\! take me in Thy arms; O Mother Kālī\!  
take me in Thy arms.

O Mother\! come now as Tārā with a smiling face and  
clad in white;

As dawn descends on dense darkness of the night. O Mother\! terrific Kālī\! I have worshiped Thee alone  
so long.

My worship is finished; now, O Mother, bring down Thy  
sword.31

Rāmprasād complains in many of his songs that Kālī is indifferent to his well-being, that she makes him suffer and brings his worldly desires to naught and his worldly goods to ruin.



Mother who art the joy of Hara’s \[Śiva’s\] heart, and who dost bring to naught the hopes of men, thou hast made void what hope was left to me.

Though I place my soul an offering at thy feet, some calamity befalls. Though I think upon thy loveliness, unceasing death is mine.

Thou dost frustrate my desires, thou art the spoiler of my fortunes. Well do I know thy mercy, Mother of mine.

Great were my desires, and I spread them all out as a salesman does his wares. Thou didst see the display, I suppose, and didst bring confusion upon me. . . .

My wealth, my honour, kith and kin, all have gone, and I have nothing now to call my own.

What further use is there for me? Wretched indeed am I.

I have sought my own ends, and now there is no limit to my grief.

Thou who dost take away sorrow, to me most wretched hast thou given sorrow. And I must all this unhappy lot endure.32

He complains that she does not behave in the ways mothers are supposed to behave, that she does not hearken to his pleas.



Can mercy be found in the heart of her who was born of the stone \[a reference to her being the daughter of Himālaya\]?

Were she not merciless, would she kick the breast of her lord?

Men call you merciful, but there is no trace of mercy in you, Mother.

You have cut off the heads of the children of others, and these you wear as a garland around your neck.

It matters not how much I call you “Mother, Mother.” You hear me, but you will not listen.33

To be Kālī’s child, Rāmprasād often asserts, is to suffer, to be disappointed in terms of worldly desires and pleasures. Kālī does not give what is normally expected. She does allow her devotee/child, however, to glimpse a vision of himself that is not circumscribed by physical and material limitations. As Rāmprasād says succinctly: “He who has made Kālī ... his only goal easily forgets worldly pleasures.”34 Indeed, that person has little choice, for Kālī does not indulge her devotees in worldly pleasures. It is her very refusal to do so that enables her devotees to reflect on dimensions of themselves and of reality that go beyond bodily comfort and world security.

An analysis of the significance of Kālī to the Hindu tradition reveals certain constants in her mythology and imagery. She is almost always associated with blood and death, and it is difficult to imagine two more polluting realities in the context of the purity-minded culture of Hinduism. As such, Kālī is a very dangerous being. She vividly and dramatically thrusts upon the observer things that he or she would rather not think about. Within the civilized order of Hinduism, within the order of dharma, blood and death are acknowledged—it is impossible not to acknowledge their existence in human life—but they are acknowledged within the context of a highly ritualized, patterned, and complex social structure that takes great pains to handle them in “safe” ways, usually through rituals of purification. These rituals \(called *saṁskāras,* “refinements”\) allow individuals to pass in an orderly way through times when contact with blood and death are unavoidable. The order of dharma is not entirely naive and has incorporated into its refined version of human existence the recognition of these human inevitabilities.

But the Hindu *saṁskāras* are patterned on wishful thinking. Blood and death have a way of cropping up unexpectedly, accidentally, tragically, and dangerously. The periodic flow of menstrual blood or the death of an aged and loved old woman \(whose husband has cooperatively died before her\) are manageable within the normal order of human events. But the death of an infant or a hemorrhage, for instance, are a threat to the neat vision of the order of dharma.35 They can never be avoided with certainty, no matter how well protected one thinks one is.

Kālī may be one way in which the Hindu tradition has sought to come to terms, at least in part, with the built-in shortcomings of its own refined view of the world. It is perhaps best and even redemptive to recognize that the system does not work in every case. Reflecting on the ways in which people must negate certain realities in their attempts to create social order, anthropologist Mary Douglas writes:



Whenever a strict pattern of purity is imposed on our lives it is either highly uncomfortable or it leads into contradiction if closely followed, or it leads to hypocrisy. That which is negated is not thereby removed. The rest of life, which does not tidily fit the accepted categories, is still there and demands attention. The body, as we have tried to show, provides a basic scheme for all symbolism. There is hardly any pollution which does not have some primary physiological reference. As life is in the body it cannot be rejected outright. And as life must be affirmed, the most complete philosophies . . . must find some ultimate way of affirming that which has been rejected.36

Kālī puts the order of dharma in perspective, perhaps puts it in its place, by reminding Hindus that certain aspects of reality are untamable, unpurifiable, unpredictable, and always a threat to society’s feeble attempts to order what is essentially disorderly: life itself.

Kālī’s shocking appearance and unconventional behavior confront one with an alternative to normal society. To meditate on the dark goddess, or to devote oneself to her, is to step out of the everyday world of predictable dharmic order and enter a world of reversals, opposites, and contrasts and in doing so to wake up to new possibilities and new frames of reference. In her differentness, strangeness, indeed, in her perverse-ness, Kālī is the kind of figure who is capable of shaking one’s comforting and naive assumptions about the world. In doing this she allows a clearer perception of how things really are.37

Kālī allows \(or perhaps forces\) better perception by enabling one to see the complete picture. She allows one to see behind the bounteousness of the other goddesses who appear in benign forms. Kālī reveals the insatiable hunger that logically must lie behind their amazing fecundity and liberality. Similarly, Kālī permits individuals to see their overall roles in the cosmic drama. She invites a wider, more mature, more realistic reflection on where one has come from and where one is going. She allows the individual to see himself or herself as merely one being in an endless series of permutations arising from the ever-recurring cycles of life and death that constitute the inner rhythms of the divine mother. As cycling and recycled energy, as both the creation and the food of the goddess, the individual is permitted to glimpse social roles and identities in perspective, to see them as often confining and as obscuring a clear perception of how things really are and who he or she really is. Kālī reveals that ultimately all creatures are her children and also her food and that no social role or identity can remove the individual from this sacrificial give and take. While this truth may appear grim, its realization may be just what is needed to push one over the threshold into the liberating quest for release from bondage to *saṁsāra.*

The extent to which Kālī invites or provokes one over the threshold from order to Anti-structure is seen in the roles she requires of those who would establish any intimacy with her.38 Iconographically, it is Śiva who participates in the most intimate relations with Kālī. In probably her most famous pose, as Dakṣiṇakālī, she stands or dances upon Śiva’s prone body in the cremation ground. His eyes are closed in bliss, sleep, trance, or death—it is difficult to say which. His attitude is utterly passive and, whether he is dead or not, his appearance corpselike. The myth that explains the origin of this pose says that once upon a time Kālī began to dance out of control on the battlefield after having become drunk on the blood of her victims. To stop her rampage, Śiva lay down on the battlefield like a corpse so that when she danced on his body she would stop, recognizing him as her husband. It is thus as a corpse, as one of her victims, that Śiva calms Kālī and elicits her grace.39

In another myth it is the infant Śiva who calms Kālī and stops her rampage by eliciting motherly emotions from her. In this story Kālī again has defeated her enemies on the battlefield and begun to dance out of control, drunk on the blood of those she has slain. To calm her and protect the stability of the world, Śiva appears in the midst of the battlefield as an infant, crying out loudly. Seeing the child’s distress, Kālī stops her dancing, picks him up, and kisses him on the head. Then she suckles him at her breasts.40

Both the dead and infants have a liminal nature. Neither has a complete social identity. Neither fits neatly or at all into the niches and structures of normal society. To approach Kālī it is well to assume the identity of a corpse or an infant. Having no stake in the orderly structures of society, the devotee as corpse or infant is free to step out of society into the liminal environment of the goddess. The corpse is mere food for her insatiable fires, the infant mere energy, as yet raw and unrefined. Reduced to either extreme, one who approaches Kālī in these roles is awakened to a perception of reality that is difficult to grasp within the confines of the order of dharma and a socialized ego.
