title = "06 NIRṚTI"

+++

The Vedic goddesses we have looked at so far are generally benign, protective deities to whom the hymnist typically appeals for wealth, strength, and general well-being. The goddess Nirṛti has no such benign qualities. She is not mentioned very often in the *Ṛg-veda,* but when she is, the concern of the hymn is to seek protection from her or to ask that she be driven away. The scattered references to her seem to equate her with death, ill luck, and destruction. There is just one hymn in the *Ṛg-veda,* 10.59, in which she is mentioned several times, but that hymn sums up very well Nirṛti’s nature. After four verses in which renewed life, wealth, food, glorious deeds, youth, and continued long life are requested from the gods, the following refrain is invoked: “Let Nirṛti depart to distant places.” Decay, need, anger, cowardice, old age, and death: these are the ways in which Nirṛti manifests herself. She thus represents a dark side to the Vedic vision of the divine feminine.

Later Vedic literature describes Nirṛti in far more detail and mentions her more frequently than does the *Ṛg-veda.* Appropriately, she is said to be dark, to dress in dark clothes, and to receive dark husks for her share of the sacrifice,11 although once she is said to have golden locks.12 She lives in the South, the direction of the kingdom of the dead,13 is associated with pain,14 and is repeatedly given offerings with the specific intention of keeping her away from the sacrificial rituals and from the affairs of people in general.
