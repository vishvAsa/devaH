+++





Sarasvatī is one of the few important goddesses in the *Vedas* who remain significant in later Hinduism.1 In the *Vedas* her character and attributes are clearly associated with the mighty Sarasvatī River. She is the earliest example of a goddess who is associated with a river in the Indian tradition. As a river goddess she is praised for her ability both to cleanse and to fertilize. Later Vedic literature \(the *Brāhmaṇas*\) consistently associates her, even equates her, with the goddess of speech, Vāc. Increasingly in her later history her association with a river is deemphasized and her association with speech, poetry, music, and culture in general is affirmed. In classical and medieval Hinduism Sarasvatī is primarily a goddess of poetic inspiration and learning. She becomes associated with the creator god Brahmā as either his daughter or wife. In this role she is creative sound, which lends to reality a peculiar and distinctive human dimension. She becomes identified with the dimension of reality that is best described as coherent intelligibility. Sarasvatī to this day is worshiped throughout India and on her special day is worshiped by school children as the patron goddess of learning.
