Too often, many modern-day interlocutors of traditions, unfamiliar with what the terms mean, are also too quick to denounce the label of polytheism as well. This only feeds the inferiority complex that Hindus have regarding polytheism and make them opt for some version of monotheism, no matter how vacuous it is. 

Saiddhāntikas & Mādhvas have an important role here because both systems have a rich polytheist ritual praxis (worship in accordance with tāratamya) even if we accord Paratva to only one. Even Śrī-Vaișņavas, despite their strong emphasis on ekāntībhāva, have to honour Nityasūrīs and Pāñcarātrika Āvaraņa/Parivāra devatas. 

Notwithstanding all of this, all of these groups + Advaitī Smārtas have to perform vaidika nitya/naimittika karmas, which are premised on the individuality of Devas, since each Deva is the rightful recipient of its own proper honors/offerings. 

It is important to emphasize the multiplicity of gods and that we have real obligations towards real beings. They are not just some metaphors.
