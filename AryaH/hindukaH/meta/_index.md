## प्रवेशः
> The deva-s started unveiling themselves: the upward blaze of agni in the three stations, the power of vAyu, the all-encompassing indra, the natural conservations of mitra, the natural laws whose violations are punished by varuNa, the exhilaration of knowing the natural law in aryaman, the swift transmission of the maruts, the dissolution of natural bonds through their father, the archer rudra, the light of savitA, the warmth of puShA, distribution of energies through bhaga, the flow of time in viShNu, the Milky way and the earthly flows of sarasvatI, the chemistry of the ashvins, the clear reflection by bR^ihaspati, the revolutions and the cycles of the observable cosmos in soma and tvaShTa with the R^ibhus, the world axis and its precessions in Aja-ekapAd and ahir-budhnya, the origins in aditi and then the mysterious prajApati called ka, and national identity in the 3 goddess ilA, sarasvatI and bhAratI.

## असुरः
- हिन्दुकेरानकविभागात् पूर्वम् परस्परम् बह्व् अमन्यन्त देवान् असुरांश् च। असुरा इति पूज्यन्ते केचन देवास् स्पष्टम् - यथा वरुणः, रुद्रः।

## Foreign Gods
Vedas enumerate several *classes* of Gods - vasus, rudras, Adityas, Rbhus, sAdhyas, apsarases ... without enumerating their members exhaustively. That may naturally encompass foreign Gods. If the sages had regard for the *category* of Gods, thought that Gods are natural, and that there are wise members of other tribes (which is rational), they would not consider foreign Gods as worthy of contempt.

As testament to this, some Gods entered our pantheon from outside the IA core, ranging from Altaic Uma to chAmuNDa and gaNapati.
