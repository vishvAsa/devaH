title = "vajra vs Hammer"

Coming to the mace as you may have notice their euhemeric urge springs from the "earthly" representations in the Iranic world of the vazra as a ram-headed mace (again a conflation with the battering ram of indra mentioned in the RV) & Mjollnir of your folks. However, even in this a key Germanic peculiarity which illuminates the matter is ignored: the unexpected cognancy of hammer the weapon with word for sky Ger Himmel & Nordic himinn. Thus, the hammer itself was seen specifically as a weapon of heaven -- wrapping into it the dimension of the heaven bolt or meteoritic bolide. 

On the other hand the cognancy of Mjollnir (which Thor himself calls a hammer) with the Balto-Slavic molnija/milna = lightning and the weapon of Perkunas of their branch of the religion. Thus, even within the north Germanic hammer we have the multiple dimensions of the vajra. This make one wonder about the Greek hero name Mele-(u)agros -- the second part is clearly derived from the greek cognate of vajra but is first after all from a word cognate to milna-molnija-mjollnir.
