## vajra vs hammer
Coming to the mace as you may have notice their euhemeric urge springs from the "earthly" representations in the Iranic world of the vazra as a ram-headed mace (again a conflation with the battering ram of indra mentioned in the RV) & Mjollnir of your folks. However, even in this a key Germanic peculiarity which illuminates the matter is ignored: the unexpected cognancy of hammer the weapon with word for sky Ger Himmel & Nordic himinn. Thus, the hammer itself was seen specifically as a weapon of heaven -- wrapping into it the dimension of the heaven bolt or meteoritic bolide. 

On the other hand the cognancy of Mjollnir (which Thor himself calls a hammer) with the Balto-Slavic molnija/milna = lightning and the weapon of Perkunas of their branch of the religion. Thus, even within the north Germanic hammer we have the multiple dimensions of the vajra. This make one wonder about the Greek hero name Mele-(u)agros -- the second part is clearly derived from the greek cognate of vajra but is first after all from a word cognate to milna-molnija-mjollnir.

## 3 pronged

Throughout the IE world the iconography of the vajra (or cognate) is three-pronged: early on in the Anatolian world, then Greece, then India& Rome. We have held that this is an IE feature even though the RV calls it shataparvan among other things. But in the jaiminIya brAhmaNa it

is clearly mentioned as three-pronged. Thus, we have a vaidika author AruNi clearly recognize this form approximately coeval with Anatolian depictions suggesting that it was indeed an old IE conception of the weapon. A coin of Marcos Aurelios with Jupiter with 3-pronged weapon

This also brings to mind the famous AV (vulgate) incantation of the secret atharvan weapon, triShaMdhi, which can be interpreted as 3-pronged: e.g.,
अयोमुखाः सूचीमुखा अथो विकङ्कतीमुखाः ।
क्रव्यादो वातरंहस आ सजन्त्व् अमित्रान् वज्रेण त्रिषन्धिना ॥
Metal-headed, point-headed, barb-headed, flesh-eating, with the speed of wind, stick to the enemies, together with the three-pronged vajra.
Also:
यां देवा अनुतिष्ठन्ति यस्या नास्ति विराधनम् ।।
तयेन्द्रो हन्तु वृत्रहा वज्रेण त्रिषन्धिना ॥
With the [ritual] the deva-s attend, which has no failure, by that indra, the slayer of vR^itra, shall kill with teh three-pronged vajra.
