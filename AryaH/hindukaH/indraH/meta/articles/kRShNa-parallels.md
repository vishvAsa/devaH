Krishna himself derives from the archetypes of Vedic Indra.  The parallel between Indra/Vrtra and Krishna/Kaliya is obvious. He propounds and reveals the nature of self to Arjuna 'know me only' akin to Indra to Pratardhana Daivodasi in Kausitaki Upanishad. 

Indra is sarathin to to Kutsa Arjuneya is another parallel to Parathasarthy. The defiance of promises for the greater good/Rta are all Indrian. 

Ga-Avindat ie Indra finding the cattle of knowledge from Vala's destruction - in this he is the original Govinda.
