title = "Shrauta downgradation"
+++

That downgrade happen long back within shruti itself. First by prajApati and then by aupanishadic brahman.

In brAhmaNas, prajApati is the creator of devas, time entity, year and yajña. He feeds indra like a mother feeds a child (panchavimsha of samaveda) and other ākhyānas. 

In kenopanishad, brahman bests the important devas - agni couldn't burn a grass, vAyu couldn't lift it and indra came closest to the brahman in the form of yaksha. Also in taittiriyopanishad "bhIShAsmAd vAtaH pavate...", found in kAThaka too - through the fear of brahman wind

Almost all of the stories of indra's "so called negative qualities" are right there in the brahmanas. Slaying trishiras, ahalyAyai jAra, etc..
