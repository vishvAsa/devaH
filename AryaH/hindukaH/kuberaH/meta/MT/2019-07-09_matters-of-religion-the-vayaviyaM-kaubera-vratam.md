Matters of religion: the Vāyavīyaṃ Kaubera-vratam

## Setting
The bus came to halt at the underground stop. Vrishchika of pretty tresses got off the bus and walked up the stairs to reach the over-bridge. She reached the middle of the bridge and stood there looking out expectantly at the road. It was a remarkably clear day and she could see the yonder horizon where the azure heights of father Dyaus met his lover mother Pṛthivī clad in the verdant vesture of the distant woods. Vrishchika passed into a reverie at that sight and remained oblivious to the throng of people who criss-crossed the bridge in either direction. Suddenly, an ugly man sidled up beside her and before she could react to his presence he said: “Ma’am do you visit the Hindu temple at Śukramārga?” Vrishchika: “On rare occasions.” The man responded: “We need wealthy patrons like you to visit the temple more often and make donations. Please do so devī”. So saying he handed a pamphlet to her. Vrishchika wondered: “A soothsayer at the temple of the Vāyu-born vānara had once told my family that I would be the wealthiest of all my sisters. But I’m hardly in that state now. Yet, why does he even think I’m wealthy?” She snapped out of that train of thought and waved the ugly man away saying “śubham astu! It is far way from my place but I’ll try.”

She continued to look out at the road and not seeing what she wanted to see, she turned to the pamphlet. It was crowded with temple events. There was a Rudra-pūjā for the 13th pradoṣa and a Viṣṇu-pūjā for the ekādaśī. There was another event for Vināyaka, for which there was a call for people to join in a mass-recitation of the Gaṇeśopaniṣat. Yet another corner mentioned a Vaṭakini-mahotsava for the fierce ape. 

Then there was some announcements of secular events. A professor of Indian origin, who was popular with the people at the local chapter of the “right-wing debate club”, with a penchant for peddling false etymologies and outrageous counter-factual theories was giving a lecture series covering issues such as the autochthonous origin of Aryans, reading Vedic mantra-s in the Harappan inscriptions, and situating the Mahābhārata at earlier than 5000 years in India. Vrishchika said to herself: “I’m sure the puruṣa would find this buffoon quite amusing where it not for the pernicious consequences it has on our people.” 

Then there was a call for people to attend classes for language acquisition or learning the recitation of five sūkta-s from the Kṛṣṇa-yajurveda. She noticed that the latter was organized by a bābā-crazed young lady who had been her patient.

Just as her eyes wandered to the next item on the pamphlet the corner of her vision lit up with the sight of a bus halting on the road below and Indrasena saunter out of it. Upon meeting midway at the bridge the two walked ahead to towards the station to board the train for a long ride back home. Vrishchika: 

> “Dear Ātreya, when I was waiting on the bridge, I received this temple pamphlet from a man who, if my vague recollection is correct, evidently supplements his income by playing a horoscopist and palm-reader at the temple on Śukramārga. What is interesting is that just as I caught sight of you I was reading this little announcement here.” Saying so she handed it over to Indrasena. Even as he was looking at it she articulated it: 

> “It looks as though this banker Atigupta Sādhu is commissioning the consecration of an image of the Yakṣarāṭ in the northern niche of the temple on the ekadaśī of next month. It reminded me that you have yet to impart to me the rahasya of the ekadaśī-vrata that you had mentioned long ago in your hometown.”

> Indrasena: “That’s quite remarkable. There is actually more than what meets the eye here. Indeed, it was in my mind too that I convey the vidyā to you, O daughter of an Aṅgiras, for after all I’d need a dīkṣita-patnī when I impart it to the ācārya who will be doing that sthāpanā.”

> Vrishchika: “That’s interesting. So you were aware of this?”  

> Indrasena: “Yes Alini. There is a long story here that I’ve not had the chance to tell you.”  

> Vrishchika: “I’m now very curious to hear it all.”  

> Indrasena: “Atigupta Sādhu was the student of a charismatic mantravādinī from the regions of Mahākāla. He had received a magic square of Rājarāja from her and consequently his wealth greatly expanded as befits a V3. He wanted to install an image of Dhanada at the temple at Śukramārga. He employed none other than the initial teacher of mine the vaṅgasiṃha, for whom there is no “tataḥ kim?” after “dhanaṃ meru-tulyam” and he was almost half an Uesugi Kenshin of the prācya-s. 
> 
> But, as I’ve told you before, he only possessed incomplete vidyā-s. Thus, his sthāpanā failed like that of Skanda by the marāṭhā chief Raghunātharāu and the image was damaged when lightning struck the temple. 
> 
> The V3 was distraught and went to his teacher back in Mālava. She happened have studied some śāstra-siddhānta under Lootika. She then consulted your sister, who not wanting to give out my identity publicly told her that if Vitteśa were to be pleased with the said V3 he would find the right V1 who will solve his samasyā. The vaṇij went around for a while until he circuitously got introduced to me by Somakhya. I told the V3 that I could not be a sthāpakācārya at a temple but I could impart a key vrata to the vaiṣṇava sthāpaka at the temple who would then achieve success with the endeavor upon performing the vrata. This, my pretty girl, is the whole story. The vrata is none other than the one of the ekādaśī that I’ll expound to you once we are home.”

## Utpatti
Back home, taking in the good night air and the dark canopy of the nakṣatra-s, Indrasena expounded to his wife the rahasya-s of the Vāyavīyaṃ Kaubera-vratam: 

> “Dear Gautamī, first you must know why it is called the Vāyavīyaṃ Kaubera-vratam and why the ekādaśī is considered the day of the yakṣa lord. In this regard the following has been narrated by the brāhmaṇa Mahātapās to king Prajāpāla in the Varāhapurāṇa:

> महातपा उवाच:  
**शृणु** चान्यां वसुपतेर्  
उत्पत्तिं पापनाशिनीम्।  
यथा वायु-शरीरस्थो  
धनदः सम्बभूव ह ॥  
>
> आद्यं शरीरं यत् तस्मिन्  
**वायुर् अन्तःस्थितो ऽभवत्** ।  
प्रयोजनान् मूर्तिमत्त्वम्  
आतिष्ठत् क्षेत्र-देवता ॥  
तत्र मूर्तस्य वायोस् तु  
**उत्पत्तिः कीर्तिता** मया ।  
>
> तां शृणुष्व महाभाग  
कथ्यमानां मया +अनघ ॥  
ब्रह्मणः सृष्टि-कामस्य  
**मुखाद् वायुर् विनिर्ययौ** ।  
प्रचण्ड-शर्करा-वर्षी  
तं ब्रह्मा प्रत्यषेधयत् ॥  
"**मूर्तो भवस्व शान्तश् च**"  
तेनोक्तो मूर्तिमान्-भवत् ।  
सर्वेषाम् एव देवानां 
यद् वित्तं फलम् एव च ।  
तत् सर्वं पाहि येनोक्तं  
तस्माद् **धनपतिर्** भवान् ॥  
>
> तस्य ब्रह्मा ददौ तुष्टस्  
तिथिम् एकादशीं प्रभुः ।  
तस्यां अनग्नि-पक्वाशी  
यो भवेन् नियतं शुचिः ।  
तस्यापि धनदो देवस्  
तुष्टः सर्वं प्रयच्छति ॥  
एषा धनपतेर् मूर्तिः  
सर्व-किल्बिष-नाशनी ।  
य एतां शृणुयाद् भक्त्या  
पुरुषः पठते ऽपि वा ।  
सर्व-कामान् अवाप्नोति  
स्वर्ग-लोकञ् च गच्छति ॥

>
> The sage Mahātapas narrated this legend to king Prajāpāla:  
Now, listen to that other sin-destroying tale of the origin of the lord of wealth, regarding how the wealth-giver arose from the body of the god Vāyu. Within what was the primordial body, Vāyu came into being situated in its interior. For the purpose of assuming a discrete form the deity of the regions \[Vāyu\] emerged forth. Now, the origin of that form of Vāyu will be made known by me. O sinless and most fortunate you ought listen that narrated by me. Due to the god Brahmā’s creative desire Vāyu issued forth from his face. \[He emerged\] with a tremendous shower of grit/gravel. Brahmā restrained him by saying: “You should take on a pacific discrete form.” He took the form as stated by Brahmā. \[Brahmā said\]: “all this wealth of the gods, whatever they produce, you must indeed protect it”. Thus, due to what was said by Brahmā he became Dhanapati. The pleased lord Brahmā gave the ekādaśī \[as his\] lunar day. On that day, if one with discipline purifies himself and only eats food which is not cooked by fire, then the god Dhanada is pleased and gives him everything. This form of Dhanapati destroys all that is ill. If one verily listens to this narrative with devotion or the person recites it, then he attains all desires and goes to the heavenly realm.

(Continued in vAyu article.)

## tirodhAna
> V: “Dear Ātreya, may be in the regard I should add that this benign form of Vāyu, which becomes Vaiśravaṇa might relate to the magical concealment power of the yakṣa-s, tirodhā that is alluded to multiple times in the śruti. On one hand it connects Kubera with the primordial goddess Virāj. The Puruṣa hymn, echoing the cyclic generation of the primordial god Dākṣa and goddess Aditi from each other, states that the goddess Virāj arose from the Puruṣa and that conversely the Puruṣa arose from Virāj.
>
> The Atharvāṅgirasa-śruti adds that Kubera was a calf of this goddess Virāj in the form of Tirodhā which conferred the concealment (tirodhā) capacity on his folk (i.e. the yakṣa-s). This is again mentioned and worshipped in his ritual in the Taittirīya-śruti. In the AV it is said that he who knows this thing about Kubera causes his pāpaman to vanish, whereas in the TA it makes his enemies disappear, like the prācya Uesugi Kenshin experienced with his devotions. This again reflects the beneficent nature of this deity whose origin is from the primordial being. Perhaps the tirodhā power, which the Taittirīyaka-s describe as coming from the waters represents, the benefic clouds brought by Vāyu as opposed to the destructive sand storm.
>
> Finally, before we go to the ritual, O Atri, I would like to to ask you if you can think of any parallels to the connection between Vāyu and Vaiśravaṇa which might exist in the Iranian world?”

## Iranic echoes
> I.s.: “Firstly, O Āṅgirasī, it is pleasing to see that you have thoroughly acquired the śrauta-siddhānta of Puṇyajaneśa. Regarding your question — I am aware of no direct cognate of Kubera in the early Iranic world. However, we may note the following: interestingly, even in the Avesta the benign Vāyu is described as being associated with gold, a characteristic of the Yakṣarāṭ. Subsequently, among the non-Zoroastrian and para-Zoroastrian Iranics of the Kuṣāṇa empire it appears that the personification of royal power, Avestan Khvarena (Kuṣāṇa: Pharro), came to identified with Vaiśravaṇa. This is not surprising given both their association with royal power. This led to syncretic depictions in the Kuṣaṇa age that appear to have eventually reached the eastern steppes whose new masters were the Turkic and Mongolic people. This greatly influenced the development of the Kubera-like deity Kut-Tengri among the Uighurs and other central Asian Turks.”

## vrata
> V: “Now, O Atricandra, expound to me details of the ritual — the observances, actions and the mantra-s.”  

### tarpaNa
> I.s: “Sure. The vrata, as has been specified, should be done on an ekādaśī, either in the afternoon or in the evening. After having had a bath the ritualists should observe purity and abstain from sexual activity for the entire day. They should eat air-dried fruits and nuts. They should abstain from consuming milk products but they may drink fresh fruit juices. In old Bhārata the ideal spot for the ritual was said to be under an aśvattha or a vaṭa tree but these days such spots are difficult to come by.
>
> First the ritualists should offer tarpaṇa to the key teachers of the lineage: the founder was a sage of the Vaikhānasa clan. That knowledge then passed on to the queen Vāsavadattā. Her son the renowned Naravāhanadatta was next. His minister Gomukha was next. These were the teachers of the lore at Kauśāmbī. 
> 
> Then the lore was taught at the holy city of Mathurā, where all the great dharma-s were expounded by the mantra-vit-s. As you know both Somakhya and I trace our lineages to gharāṃnāya-s of that holy city. There it was taught in the center known as the Yakṣa-guhā, which is today Maholi near the Mathurā city. Here the teachers were Gomitraka and Kunika. 
> 
> From there the tradition moved to Gopagiri (modern Gwalior), where it was taught by your old clansmen, the Gotama Rudradāsa and his son Śivatrāta. From them it was transmitted to Śivanemi, Śivabhadra and Kubhaka.
> 
> From there it was transmitted along the Candravati river (modern West Banas) to the V1 Maṇibhadra who lived in Vāyvagrahāra (a little hamlet near modern Banaskantha) in the Lāṭānarta country. He transmitted it to his students Kuberadatta and Yakṣamitra who lived at Vāyuvaṭa (modern Vayad). All these V1s were special worshipers of Vāyu at his prāsāda-s that were once prominent in the region and the rite we perform takes its form in their teachings.  

> V: “It is indeed rather remarkable that even today we have nearly forgotten remnants of the old cult at these key cultic centers, like the Vāyu temples in Lāṭa and the Vitteśa near a step-well in their vicinity, or the images of Nalakūbara at Gopagiri and the fragment of the old Yakṣarāṭ-prāsāda at Kauśāmbī.”

> I.s: “If the Yakṣa is good to us, may be some day we shall visit those cultic centers to revive our connection. To continue, the ritualist then salutes his teachers: ‘oṃ gurubhyo namaḥ ।‘. 

### The rite
The spot of the rite should be to the north of the trunk of the said tree for indeed the northern line is where Vāyu, Vitteśa and Bhava, all deities of the rite, are stationed. The ritualist begins by uttering the yajuṣ:  

> iṣé tvorjé tvā vāyávaḥ sthopāyávaḥ stha devó vaḥ savitā́ prā́rpayatu śréṣṭhatamāya kármaṇe ।  
> For vigor you; for nourishment you; the Vāyu-s abide, the approachers abide. Let the god Savitṛ set you in motion for the most excellent ritual.

Vrishchika, here you may note the multiplicity of the Vāyu-s reminiscent of the Aeolian plurality seen among our yavana cousins. Then he stands up and recites the following ṛk-s:  
> stóma-trayastriṁśe bhúvanasya patni vívasvad vāte abhí no gṛṇāhi ।  
ghṛtávatī savitar ā́dhipatyaiḥ páyasvatī rántir ā́śā no astu ॥  
dhruvā́ diśā́ṃ viṣṇupatny ághorāsyéśānā sáhaso yā́ manótā ।  
bṛhaspátir mātaríśvotá vāyúḥ saṃdhuvānā́ vā́tā abhí no gṛṇantu ॥  
viṣṭambhó divó dharúṇaḥ pṛthivyā́ asyéśānā jágato víṣṇupatnī ।  
viśvávyacā iṣáyantī súbhūtiḥ śivā́ no astv áditir upásthe ॥  
O you of the 33-fold stoma, lady of the world, with winds set in motion by Vivāsvān, may you be gracious to us.  
Rich in ghee, O Savitṛ, through your overlordship, may the generous space be rich in milk for us.  
Firm among the quarters, wife of Viṣṇu, the benign \[lady\], the strong queen of all, the desirable one;  
Bṛhaspati, Matariśvan, Vāyu, the Vāta-s blowing in unison, may all be gracious to us.  
Stabilizer of the sky, supporter of the earth, ruling this world, wife of Viṣṇu.  
Encompassing all space, invigorating all, prosperous, may the goddess Aditi be auspicious to us in her lap.

### Excavation
He then marks out a square area on the ground with the side equal to his full arm’s length and sweeps it clean. Within it he marks out another square region with a side equal to his span. He does this with the sphya
(the wooden sword) while chanting the formula:  
> ástabhnād dyā́m ṛṣabhó antárikṣam  
ámimīta varimā́ṇam pṛthivyā́  
ā́sīdad viśvā bhúvanāni samrā́ḍ  
víśvet tā́ni váruṇasya vratā́ni ॥  
> The bull has stabilized the sky \[and\] the atmosphere; he has measured the circumference of the earth; he has set him in all worlds as the emperor. All these are Varuṇa’s laws.

He then digs out a cuboidal excavation corresponding to the central smaller square. While doing so he recites the yajuṣ:  
> víṣṇoḥ krámo ‘si  
> víṣṇoḥ krāntám asi  
> víṣṇor víkrāntam asi । 
> 
> námo mātré pṛthivyái  
> mā́hán mātáram pṛthivī́m̐ him̐siṣam mā́ ।  
> mā́ṃ mātā́ pṛthivī́ him̐sīt ॥  
> You are the stepping of Viṣṇu; you are the step of Viṣṇu; you are the stride of Viṣṇu. Salutation to mother Earth; may I not harm mother Earth; may mother Earth not harm me.

The he fills the sruc with ghee using the the sruva and pours out the ghee into excavation uttering the yajuṣ:  
> vāyáve tvā  
> váruṇāya tvā  
> nírṛtyai tvā  
> rudrā́ya tvā svāhā ।  
> vā́yo vī́hi stokā́nām ॥  
> For you Vāyu; for you Varuṇa; for you Nirṛti; for you Rudra, hail! O Vāyu, taste the drops!

He then fills the sruc again with milk pours it into the excavation uttering the incantation:  
> vásur vásupatir híkam ási।  
> kṣatrā́ṇāṃ kṣatrápatir asi ।
> áti divás pāhi । 
> vaiśravaṇāya svāhā॥  
> You are indeed rich, the lord of riches. You are the the king of the kings. From the heavenly realm protect us. To Vaiśravaṇa hail.”

### Burial
Indrasena then brought out a bronze image of a chameleon and showed it to Vrishchika and explained further: 

“The ritualist should have such a bronze image of a chameleon, which as you know is the special animal of the Yakṣapati. Alternatively, he may have a metal plate with the image of a chameleon etched on it. He deposits it in the excavation for the rite and may reuse it over and over, each time he performs the rite. He takes up the image reciting the following incantation:  
> iyaṃ varṇagodhā vaiśravaṇa-rūpā bahuvarṇikā ।  
tirodhā ‘si ।  
hiraṇyavaktro ‘si  
vaiśravaṇo ‘si ।  
kṣatraṃ kṣatraṃ vaiśravaṇaḥ ।  
mahārājāya svāhā ॥  
This chameleon of many colors is the form of Vaiśravaṇa. You are the camouflaged one. You are the golden-cheeked one; you are Vaiśravaṇa. Kingly power, kingly power \[is that of\] Vaiśravaṇa. Hail to the great king!

He then deposits the chameleon in the excavation and with the last mantra of the above he pours out ghee from the sruva on to image. He then covers up the image by filling the excavation. 

### kalasha
To the north of the square he sets up a platform with a silk cloth on it. On that he should place an ornate bronze jar with a lid. 

He should thereafter invoke Vāyu and his wife Śivā in the jar and offers them water for arghya and pādya and incense with the following incantation of Mārkaṇḍeya:  
> vāyum āvāhayiṣyāmi  
sarvagaṃ dīptatejasam ।  
deva vāyo tvam abhy ehi  
sarva-bhūta-jagat-priya ।  
idam arghyaṃ ca pādyaṃ ca  
dhūpo’yaṃ pratigṛhyatām ॥  
> I shall invoke Vāyu of blazing splendor, who can go anywhere. O Vāyu, dear to all beings and the world, you must come here. Please accept this arghya, pādya (water for washing the feet) and incense.

> śivām āvāhayiṣyāmi  
vāyoḥ patnīṃ prabhāvatīm ।  
śive ‘bhy ehi mahābhāge  
varade kāmarūpiṇī ।  
idam arghyaṃ ca pādyaṃ ca  
dhūpo’yaṃ pratigṛhyatām ॥  
> I shall invoke Śivā of great luster, the lady of Vāyu. O highly distinguished goddess Śivā, who can assume any form, the boon-giver, come here. Please accept…

### Image
He then places an image of Kubera inside the jar. The image should ideally be fashioned generally following the teaching in this regard of the Bhārgava Mārkaṇḍeya to Vajra, the great-grandson of Kṛṣṇa, the king of Indraprastha: 

> The image of the wealth-giver Kubera should be painted dark green, i.e., the color of a lotus-leaf. He should be shown as being borne by a naras yakṣa. He should have all kinds of golden ornaments with necklaces resting on his belly. He should be shown wearing a beautiful cloak. He should have four hands and one of his eyes should be yellow. 
>
>  He must have two fangs in his mouth, and a mustache and beard on his face. His head is adorned with a jeweled crown. 
>
> On his left lap, his wife, the beautiful, boon-giving goddess Ṛddhi should be comfortably seated. She should be shown with two hands. One of them should be shown hugging the Mahārāja and the other should display a jewel-pot. 
>
>  In one of his left hands he should be shown holding a jeweled vessel and a gold-spitting mongoose in the other. In his two right hands Kubera should be shown with a mace and a śakti missile. Beside him there should be his dhvaja with the lion-emblem. A palanquin should be shown near his feet and his treasure-chests should be shown beside him in the form of a conch and a lotus filled with treasures.

If he cannot obtain such an image, any other image that is properly made might be used. However, he must use the above teaching of Mārkaṇḍeya for the dhyāna of the great Yakṣa because if he does so he obtains wealth. Mārkaṇḍeya gives the following symbolism for the image:  

>  The lord should be seen as the embodiment of all arthaśāstra-s. It is only by the institutes of arthaśāstra-s does any endeavor of a living-being exist, as was taught by Cāṇakya who devised the overthrow of the barbarous Macedonians. 
> 
> Kubera’s śakti weapon stands for royal power and his gadā represents daṇḍa-nīti.  
> Goddess Ṛddhi represents a full worldly life.  
> The jeweled vessel in her hand is the receptacle of good qualities. The kingdom over which the Yakṣapati rules is the body itself. The lotus and the conch are the reservoirs of all treasures in nature from which wealth perpetually flows. His lion flag is desire. Hence, he is known as Kāmeśvara in the Yajurveda. His two fangs are the reward and the punishment that he metes out. He who mediates thus has Kubera dwell in him.

Having placed the image of the Rājarāja in the jar he invokes him and his retinue and offers them worship with the following incantations:  
> yākṣān āvāhayiṣyāmi  
dhānādhyakṣa-samanvitān ।  
āyāntu varadā yakṣās  
trailokya-viditā mama ।  
idam arghyaṃ ca pādyaṃ ca  
dhūpo’yaṃ pratigṛhyatām ॥  
> I shall invoke the yakṣa-s together with the lord of wealth. Let the yakṣa-s renowned in the 3 worlds come to me giving boons. Please accept this arghya, pādya (water for washing the feet) and incense.

> bhadrām āvāhayiṣyāmi  
dhanādhipati-sundarīṃ ।  
ehi ṛddhi mahādevi  
varade kāma-rūpiṇī ।  
idam arghyaṃ ca pādyaṃ ca  
dhūpo’yaṃ pratigṛhyatām ॥  
> I shall invoke the lucky one, the beautiful lady of the lord of wealth. Come, O great boon-giving goddess Ṛddhi of much desired form. Please accept…

> aham āvāhayiṣyāmi  
tvām eva nalakūbaram ।  
samabhy ehi mahābhāga  
dhanadasya+ātmasaṃbhava ।  
idam arghyaṃ ca pādyaṃ ca  
dhūpo’yaṃ pratigṛhyatām ॥  
> I shall verily invoke you O Nalakūbara. May you, O fortunate one born of Dhanada, come here. Please accept…

> aham āvāhayiṣyāmi  
śibikāṃ paramāyatām ।  
śibike tvam ihā ‘bhy ehi  
sarva-sattva-sukhaṅkari ।  
idam arghyaṃ ca pādyaṃ ca  
dhūpo’yaṃ pratigṛhyatām ॥  
> I shall invoke the wide palanquin of Kubera. O palanquin who generates all good and pleasures may you come here. Please accept…

> naram āvāhayiṣyāmi  
narādhipati-vāhanam ।  
nara śīghraṃ tvam ‘bhy ehi  
tathā nṛpatināyaka ।  
idam arghyaṃ ca pādyaṃ ca  
dhūpo’yaṃ pratigṛhyatām ॥  
> I shall invoke the Naras yakṣa who is the vehicle of the king \[Kubera\]. O Naras may you quickly come here, you have the king as your lord \[Kubera\]. Please accept…

> śaṅkham āvāhayiṣyāmi  
nidhi-pravaram uttamam ।  
śīghraṃ śaṅkha tvam abhy ehi  
dhānādhipati-vallabha ।  
idam arghyaṃ ca pādyaṃ ca  
dhūpo’yaṃ pratigṛhyatām ॥  
> I shall invoke the conch, the foremost of excellent treasures. May you, O conch, quickly come here, the one dear to the lord of wealth. Please accept…

> padmam āvāhayiṣyāmi  
nidhi-pravaram uttamam ।  
padmaṃ śīghraṃ tvam abhy ehi  
mahāvibhava-kāraka ।  
idam arghyaṃ ca pādyaṃ ca  
dhūpo’yaṃ pratigṛhyatām ॥  
> I shall invoke the lotus, the foremost of excellent treasures. May you, O lotus, quickly come here producing great prosperity. Please accept…

### Adoration
Then he offers flowers, honey and bhakṣaṇa-s to the image of Kubera with the famous incantation from the Taittirīya-āraṇyaka:  
> rājādhirājāya prasahyasāhine । namo vayam vaiśravaṇāya kurmahe । sa me kāmān kāmakāmāya mahyam । kāmeśvaro vaiśravaṇo dadātu ।  
kuberāya vaiśravaṇāya । mahārājāya namaḥ ॥

He should thereafter make the triple-arghya offerings as ordained by the gāyatrī-s of Vaikhānasa-s:  
> rāja-rājāya vidmahe  
dhanādhyakṣāya dhīmahi ।  
tan no rājā pracodayāt ॥  
rudra-sakhāya vidmahe  
vaiśravaṇāya dhīmahi ।  
tan naḥ kuberaḥ pracodayāt ॥  
yakṣeśvarāya vidmahe  
gadā-hastāya dhīmahi ।  
tan no yakṣaḥ pracodayāt ॥

### Bali
Then he offers bali to Dhaneśa and Nalakūbara meditating upon them traversing the heavens in the Puṣpaka space-station made by the god Tvaṣtṛ which is alluded to in the mantra. This is as per the Aruṇa-ketuka-vidhi with the incantations:  

> अद्भयस् तिरोधाऽजायत ।  
तव वैश्रवणस् सदा ।  
तिरोधेहि सपत्नान् नः ।  
ये अपो ऽश्नन्ति केचन ।  
त्वाष्ट्रीं मायां वैश्रवणः ।  
रथँ सहस्र-बन्धुरम् ।  
> पुरुश्-चक्रँ सहस्राश्वम् ।  
> आस्थायायाहि नो बलिम् ।  
> यस्मै भूतानि बलिम् आवहन्ति ।  
> धनङ् गावो हस्ति-हिरण्यम् अश्वान् ।  
> असाम सुमतौ यज्ञियस्य ।  
> श्रियम् बिभ्रतो ऽन्नमुखीं विराजम् ।  
> सुदर्शने च क्रौञ्चे च ।  
> मैनाके च महागिरौ ।  
> शत-द्वाट्टारगमन्ता ।  
> सँहार्यन् नगरं तव ।  
>
> इति मन्त्राः । कल्पोऽत ऊर्ध्वम् ।  
> यदि बलिँ हरेत् । हिरण्य-नाभये वितुदये कौबेरायायम् बलिः । सर्वभूतधिपतये नम इति ।  
> अथ बलिँ हृत्वोपतिष्ठेत ।  
> क्षत्रं क्षत्रं वैश्रवणः । ब्राह्मणा वयँ स्मः ।  
> नमस्ते अस्तु मा माहिँसीः ॥

After that he makes bali offerings to the rakṣa-s, yakṣa-s and yakṣī-s in the entourage of Kubera with:  

> मिश्र-वाससः कौबेरका  
> रक्षो-राजेन प्रेषिताः ।  
ग्रामँ स-जानयो गच्छन्तीछन्तो परिदाकृतान् ॥  
> Wearing mixed clothes the agents of Kubera, directed by the king of the rakṣa-s together with the \[yakṣī\] consorts go as they please to the villages granting protection.

### होमः
There after he sets up a sthaṇḍila in the square he has marked out. He strews darbha grass with the shoots facing north. He installs the fire therein from his aupāsana or āhavanīya altar or kindles it afresh. 

#### पूर्वाङ्गम्
He recites this ṛk:  

> वैश्वानरं कवयो यज्ञियासो  
> ऽग्निं देवा अजनयन्न् अजुर्यम् । 
> नक्षत्रम् प्रत्नम् अमिनच् चरिष्णु  
> यक्षस्याध्यक्षं तविषम् बृहन्तम् ॥  
> The gods, the poets of the ritual, generated the unaging Agni Vaiśvānara,  
the primordial star, wandering but not violating \[the natural law\], the mighty and great lord of the yakṣa.

He makes an oblation of ghee with: 
> agnaye vaiśvānarāya svāhā ।  
idam agnaye vaiśvānāya na mama ।

If he is a purohita performing it on behalf of a yajamāna other than himself, like at the temple it would be done with the V3, then the yajamāna must recite the tyāga-mantra ‘idam…na mama‘ as the oblation is offered. 

Then he recites:  

> dhātā́ rātíḥ savitédáṃ juṣantām  
prajā́patir nidhipátir no agníḥ ।  
tváṣṭā víṣṇuḥ prajáyā saṁrarāṇó  
yájamānāya dráviṇaṃ dadhātu ॥  
> May Dhatṛ the giver, may Savitṛ, rejoice in this \[oblation\], Prajāpati, the lord of treasures, and Agni, for us; may Tvaṣtṛ and Viṣṇu generously give wealth with offspring to the ritualist.

He makes an oblation of ghee with:  
> devebhyaḥ svāhā । idam devebhyo na mama ।

#### मुख्यम्
He then prepares for the core oblations of the yajña by deploying the nigada recitation as in the vaidika rite calling upon the god Agni who is of the brāhmaṇa-s and the Bhārata-s to bring the gods of the rite for receiving the oblations:  

> ॐ अग्ने महाँ असि ब्राह्मण भारत ।  
> देवेद्धो, मन्विद्ध घृताहवनः, प्रणीर् यज्ञानां, रथीर् अध्वराणाम्, अतूर्तो, होता, तूर्णिर् हव्यवाट् ।  
> त्वं परिभूर् अस्य् आ वह देवान् यजमानाय ॥  
> वायुं नियुत्वन्तम् आ वह ।  
> कुबेरं वैश्रवणम् आ वह ।  
> रुद्रम् पशुपतिम् आ वह ।  
> देवाँ आज्यपाँ आ वह ॥

He then offers in the northern side of the sthaṇḍila with the sruva:  

> prajāpatye svāhā । idam prajāpatye na mama ॥

##### वायवे
He utters the call ‘astu śrau3ṣaṭ ।‘ and starts filling he sruc and as he does so he recites:  

> तव वायव् ऋतस्पते  
त्वष्टुर् जामातर् अद्भुत ।  
अवांस्य् आ वृणीमहो३म् ॥  
> Vāyu, lord of the natural law, of wondrous form, Tvaṣṭṛ’s son-in-law, your protection we choose.

Then he recites:  
> प्र वायुम् अच्छा बृहती मनीषा  
बृहद् रयिं विश्ववारं रथप्राम् ।  
द्युतद्यामा नियुतः पत्यमानः  
कविः कविम् इयक्षसि प्रयज्यो३म् ॥  
वौ३षट् । इदं वायवे नियुत्वते न मम ॥  
> \[Our\] great meditation (goes) forth to Vāyu; with great wealth and all that is excellent, he fills his chariot;  
> on the brilliant path, master of horse-teams, you the poet seeks to reach the poet \[i.e. the hymn-composing vipra\], you who are worshiped at the forefront of the ritual.

At the vauṣaṭ call he makes the oblation and then utters the tyāga-mantra. He makes the oblation facing whichever direction the wind blows at the time he is reciting the this mantra. 

#### कुबेराय
He utters the call ‘astu śrau3ṣaṭ ।‘ and starts filling he sruc and as he does so he recites:  

> रायस् पोषायायुषा त्वा निधीशो भ्रातृव्याणां महसां चाधिपत्यो३म् ।  
> \[I invoke you\] for riches and prosperity with a long life. The lord of wealth \[is worshiped\] for taking over the glory of our rivals and for overlordship.

This peculiarly-formed mantra is that of the old Jambhala-vit Vaikhānasa, the master of divine rituals. Then he recites:  

> दूरे पूर्णेन वसति, दूर ऊनेन हीयते ।  
महद् यक्षं भुवनस्य मध्ये  
तस्मै बलिं राष्ट्रभृतो भरन्तो३म् ॥  
वौ३षट् । इदं कुबेराय वैश्रवणाय न मम ॥  
In fullness he dwells in the distance, is left behind in distance on diminishing;  
A mighty Yakṣa is in the center of the universe:  
to him the tributary rulers bring tribute.

At the vauṣaṭ call he makes the oblation and then utters the tyāga-mantra. 

I should mention that this is the mysterious mantra is of the Bhṛgu-s by knowing which one becomes the complete Jambhala-vit. It was taught to me by Somakhya on a dark new moon night as we were wandering in a beautiful mountainous region. This completed my learning of the tradition and conferred on me the ability to perform this ritual. The thing which dwells in distance in full and then diminishes is an allusion to the moon. This disappearance of the moon is in turn indicative of tirodhā, the famed concealing power of the Yakṣa. 

#### रुद्राय
He then utters the call ‘astu śrau3ṣaṭ ।‘, starts filling he sruc and as he does so he recites:  

> कद् रुद्राय प्रचेतसे  
> मीऌहुष्टमाय तव्यसे ।  
> वोचेम शन्तमं हृदो३म् ॥
> 
> What might we say to Rudra, the wise,  
> the most generous and mighty one;  
> what might we say that is most pleasing to his heart?

> उप ते स्तोमान् पशुपा इवाकरं  
रास्वा पितर् मरुतां सुम्नम् अस्मे ।  
भद्रा हि ते सुमतिर् मृळयत्तमा  
ऽथा वयम् अव इत् ते वृणीमहो३म् ॥  
वौ३षट् ।  
> इदं रुद्राय पशुपतये न मम ॥  
> 
> Like a cowherd, I have driven these praises close to you.  
Grant your favor to us, father of the Marut-s,  
for your benevolence is auspicious, most merciful.  
It is indeed your aid that we choose. \[translation after Geldner\]

At the vauṣaṭ call he makes the oblation, then utters the tyāga-mantra and then touches water.

#### स्रुवाहुतयः
Then with the sruva he utters the following mantra-s and makes an offering of ghee at each svāhā followed by the tyāga-mantra ‘idaṃ na mama‘:  

> इन्द्रः स्वाहा ।  
> मरुतः स्वाहा ।  
> सर्व-निधिदो रत्न-धातुमान् स्वाहा ।  
> तिरोधा भूः स्वाहा ।  
> तिरोधा भुवः स्वाहा ।  
> तिरोधा स्वः स्वाहा ।  
> तिरोधा भूर्-भुवः-स्वः स्वाहा ।  
> कामेश्वराय स्वाहा ।  
> कुबेराय स्वाहा ।  
> धन्याय स्वाहा ।  
> वैश्रवणाय स्वाहा ।  
> यक्ष-राजाय स्वाहा ॥

#### स्विष्टकृत्
He then initiates the expiatory sviṣṭakṛt-yāga by reciting the mantra of my ancestor Vasuśruta Ātreya:  

> ॐ जुष्टो दमूना अतिथिर् दुरोण  
इमं नो यज्ञम् उप याहि विद्वान् ।  
विश्वा अग्ने अभियुजो विहत्या  
शत्रूयताम् आ भरा भोजनानो३म् ॥  
> 
> As the satisfied lord of the house and the guest in the home,  
journey to this our yajña, the learned god,  
Having demolished all assaults, O Agni,  
bring here the sustenance of our enemies.

He utters the call ‘astu śrau3ṣaṭ ।‘ and fills the sruc. He then recites:  

> अग्निं स्विष्टकृतम् अयाड्  
> वायोर् नियुत्वतः प्रिया धामान्य् अयाट्  
> कुबेरस्य वैश्रवणस्य प्रिया धामान्य् अयाड्  
> रुद्रस्य पशुपतेः प्रिया धामान्य् अयाड्
>   
> देवानाम् आज्यपानां प्रिया धामानि यक्षद्  
> अग्नेर् होतुः प्रिया धामानि यक्षत्  
> स्वं महिमानम् आयजतामेज्या इषः कृणोतु,  
> सो अध्वरा जातवेदा जुष्टाँ हविर् मार्जाल्यो मृज्यते स्वे दमूनाः  
> कवि-प्रशस्तो अतिथिः शिवो नः ।  
> सहस्र-शृङ्गो वृषभस् तद् ओजा  
> विश्वाँ अग्ने सहसा प्रास्य् अन्यान् वौ३षट् ॥

At the vauṣaṭ call he makes the offering from the sruc and utters: ‘idam agnaye sviṣṭakṛte na mama।‘ 

The terminal mantra of the sviṣṭakṛt-yāga is also composed by my ancestors Budha Ātreya and Gaviṣṭhira Ātreya:  

> Fit to be kindled, he is kindled in his own (house) as master of the  
house, praised by poets, our auspicious guest.  
A thousand-horned bull having its virility,  
O Agni, in might you excel all others.

#### रौद्रशमनम्
Then he offers a homa to the Vināyaka-s, Skanda, and other anuyāyin-s of Rudra which include the Yakṣapati himself so that the yajamāna-s rite might be successful and he and his family not be harmed. He utters the tyāga-mantra ‘idaṃ na mama‘ after each svāhā call:  

> ओँ शालकटङ्कटाय विनायकाय स्वाहा ।  
> कुष्माण्डराजपुत्राय विनायकाय स्वाहा ।  
> उस्मिताय विनायकाय स्वाहा ।  
> देवयजनाय विनायकाय स्वाहा ।  
> विमुखाय स्वाहा ।  
> श्येनाय स्वाहा ।  
> बकाय स्वाहा ।  
> यज्ञाय स्वाहा ।  
> कलहाय स्वाहा ।  
> भीरवे स्वाहा ।  
> यज्ञविक्षेपिणे स्वाहा ।  
> कुलङ्गापमाराय स्वाहा ।  
> यूपकेश्यै स्वाहा ।  
> सूकरक्रोड्यै स्वाहा ।  
> 
> उमायै हैमवत्यै स्वाहा ।  
> जम्भकाय स्वाहा ।  
> वीरूपाक्षाय स्वाहा ।  
> लोहिताक्षाय स्वाहा ।  
> 
> वैश्रवणाय स्वाहा ।  
> महाराजाय स्वाहा ।  
> 
> महासेनाय स्वाहा ।  
> कुमाराय स्वाहा ।  
> विशाखाय स्वाहा ।  
> शाखाय स्वाहा ।  
> नेजमेषाय स्वाहा ।  
> षष्ठ्यै स्वाहा ।  
> रुद्राय महादेवाय स्वाहा ॥

He then touches water. Thereafter he takes up some grain and throws it in the south-west direction for the rakṣa-s uttering: ‘rakṣasām bhago ‘si ।‘ Then he touches water again and takes up the darbha grass and casts it into the fire reciting:  

> Om̐ sáṃ barhír aṅktām̐ havíṣā ghṛténa  
> sám ādityáir vásubhiḥ sáṃ marúdbhiḥ  
> sám índro viśvádevebhir aṅktāṃ  
> divyáṃ nábho gacchatu yát svā́hā ॥  
> idaṃ divyāya nabhase na mama ।  
> 
> rudrāya paśupatye svāhā ।  
> idaṃ rudrāya paśupataye na mama॥  
>
> Auspicious \[is\] the grass smeared with offerings and ghee. Let Indra together with the Āditya-s, the Vasu-s, Marut-s, and the Viśvedeva-s go (having been honored). Let svāhā-offerings rise to the heavenly ether.
> 
> Hail to Rudra Paśupati.

#### समाप्तिः
Then he recites the following to conclude the yajña with the recitation of Agastya:  

> अग्ने नय सुपथा राये अस्मान्  
विश्वानि देव वयुनानि विद्वान् ।  
युयोध्य् अस्मज् जुहुराणम् एनो  
भूयिष्ठां ते नम-उक्तिं विधेम ॥  
> O Agni, lead us to wealth by an easy path:  
you know all the rituals, O god.  
Keep us from ritual transgression.  
May we offer you the greatest reverence.

He finally recites the śānti-mantra-s: ‘tac chamyor…‘ and ‘namo vāce yā coditā…‘ 

He then goes to the jar with the image of Kubera and utters the formulae: 

> वायुः सुप्रीतः सुप्रसन्नो  
> यथा स्थानं तिष्ठतु ।  
> वैश्रवणो राजा सुप्रीतः सुप्रसन्नो  
> यथा स्थानं तिष्ठतु ।

He and his family drink some of the honey offered to the yakṣa and he distributes the bhakṣaṇa-s to the beholders of the ritual. He gives a toothbrush, sandals and umbrella along with a hefty ritual fee if he is a yajāmāna who has employed a purohita to do the rite for him.”

## Comments
> V: “I must remark that the final homa has a set of rather remarkable deities. Perhaps we are seeing the worship of Vārāhī for the first time in Sūkarakroḍī. I also wonder if Yūpakeśī is some early version of Cāmuṇḍā. Beyond that I’m most inspired by this account of the rite and feel that I have become a Jambhala-jñā”
