      <description>&lt;p&gt;A Nepalian image of kAlachakra and vishvamAtA. While the emanation of the primordial cosmic buddha, the two deities were modeled after the shaiva bhairava-bhairavI-yAmala. The kAlachakra tantra, promulgating their worship, was the last great bauddha tantra to be composed (=revealed for insiders) in India. It is believed to have been composed in ~1000s-1100s as the ravages of the Meccan demons, which it records, started unfolding in the north of the subcontinent. As the well of the bauddha-mata was being defiled in the subcontinent (to paraphrase Andre Wink) and its vast Central Asian lands were falling to the tAyin-s or mlechCha-s, it was a religion in crisis (especially its vajrayANa stream).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
