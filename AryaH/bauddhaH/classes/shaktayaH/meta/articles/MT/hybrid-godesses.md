As an aside I was looking up the Tibetan book of dead, ~1300s; 1 encounter numerous avi-/thero-cephalic iconographies of H goddesses absorbed by the vajrayAna from shaiva tradition. There we have: 

- the wolf-headed bluish-green vAyudevI
- brown ibex-headed agnAyI
- sow-headed vArAhI
- the brownish crow-headed chAmunNDI
- darkgreen elephant-headed bhUjanA
- snake-headed blue-green varuNAnI

Some of iconographies are not TMK seen in a surviving H text but could have once been there.
