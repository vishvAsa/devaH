The Orphic tradition preserves some interesting motifs that are not found in the mainstream Greek theogonies.

**Zeus and Demeter** mate as a pair of snakes. They engender the awful goddess **Persephone (Kore)** as a result. She is said to be two-headed and horned. Demeter is so alarmed by her appearance that she flees from her without suckling her. However, Demeter later takes her back to her house and hands over the overladyship of the goddesses to Kore. 

Persephone consorts with **Apollo** to give birth to the nine glorious fiery-faced children known as the **Eumenides** (a possible link to the Rudra-class deity generating a multiplicity of fiery offspring). 
   
In a parallel myth, **Persephone and Zeus** mating again in the form of snakes engender **Dionysus**. Zeus bears him in his thigh (another old motif) and finally hands him over to the nursing goddess Hipta and he is guarded by gods known as the Kouretes. Zeus then makes him the king of the gods, but the Titans decide to kill him. They whiten their faces with gypsum to look like gods, and deceiving him cut him into seven pieces (the paurāṇika **Marut** motif).

However, **Athena** saves his heart which is still beating – because it was palpitating she got the name **Pallas**. Zeus with the gods attacked the Titans and he kills them with his thunderbolt and forced Atlas to carry the sky. 

From the soot of the Titans burnt by his thunderbolt, Zeus generates the living beings with a soul that will keep reincarnating passing from body to body of these beings, & are meted punishments/rewards as per their deeds by Hermes. 

Apollo inters the remains of Dionysus & from the heart Zeus creates a new Dionysus to rejoin the pantheon.
