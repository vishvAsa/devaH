Erikepaius is a likely ortholog of none other than our Vṛṣākapi, who is celebrated in RV 10.86. He is described as a friend of Indra and was later identified with Viṣṇu (we do not know if that identification already existed in the RV). The great patriot Tilak identified him with the Orion region of the sky that is more commonly associated with the Hindu protogonic deity Prajāpati. We agree that this is a valid identification, and it suggests a link between the two in the ancient past. We believe that Vṛṣākapi is a rare surviving memory of a protogonic entity linked to Indra in the RV and incorporated into Zeus in the Greek world. The watery haviṣ +++(mentioned in the sUkta)+++ might be linked to the carrying of the seed of the gods by Erikepaius.

A memory of the engulfment of Erikepaios and the regeneration of the universe from Zeus, is implied in this  fragment of laud of the god in the Orphic tradition:

> Zeus was born first, Zeus last, ruler of the thunderbolt.  
Zeus is the head, Zeus the middle, from Zeus are all things made.  
Zeus is the foundation of earth and starry heaven.  
Zeus was male, Zeus was an immortal nymph  
Zeus is the breath of all, Zeus is the thrust of tireless fire.  
Zeus is the root of the sea; Zeus is the sun and moon.  
Zeus the king, Zeus the ruler of all, ruler of the thunderbolt.  
For after he had hidden them all away,  
again into the glad light from his holy heart he brought them up,  
performing mighty acts.

The importance of the heart in this tradition is paralleled  by an incantation in the soma rite, where the essence of the universe is said to be distilled into indra's heart via soma:

One may also consider the triShTubh incantation of our ancient clansman, the kAvya describing indra as the heart of the gods:
