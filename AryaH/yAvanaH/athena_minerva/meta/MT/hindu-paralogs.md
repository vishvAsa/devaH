One could call the +++(minervaâ†’)+++ manyu motif a paralog of the Athena motif -- the two come together in the H world as vIrabhadra and bhadrakAlI -- but now from rudra (one version of this shaiva myth explicitly states that they were generated from a lock of hair on rudra's head).

Talking of the Athena motif one *might* be able to read it in the mantra: uSho yad adya bhAnunA vi dvArAv R^iNavo divaH | ushas (the daughter of dyaus) today with her rays pushed apart the doors of dyaus. Like the ushas, Athena is a prominent as charioteer goddess; one e.g. (vase pic).

sA no rathena bR^ihatA vibhAvari shrudhi chitrAmaghe havam | With her great chariot. or

acheti divo duhitA maghonI vishve pashyanty uShasaM vibhAtIm |
AsthAd rathaM svadhayA yujyamAnam A yam ashvAsaH suyujo vahanti ||
