      <description>&lt;p&gt;The yavana deity Hephaistos is a cognate of tvaShTR^i &amp;amp; like him forges the various weapons of the gods, including the arrows of Zeus as we saw before. He had 3 assistants the Cyclopes known as Brontes, Steropes and Arges who specifically made the thunderbolt of Zeus. In addition to these 3, he is said to have made several robots that assisted him in his forge. The 3 Cyclopes may be seen as the cognates of the 3 R^ibhu-s who augment the productions of tvaShTR^i in the Arya world. The specific act of making the thunderbolt appears to have been transferred to these 3 in the yavana world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
