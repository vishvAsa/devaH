The yavana deity Hephaistos is a cognate of tvaShTR^i & like him forges the various weapons of the gods, including the arrows of Zeus as we saw before. He had 3 assistants the Cyclopes known as Brontes, Steropes and Arges who specifically made the thunderbolt of Zeus. In addition to these 3, he is said to have made several robots that assisted him in his forge. The 3 Cyclopes may be seen as the cognates of the 3 R^ibhu-s who augment the productions of tvaShTR^i in the Arya world. The specific act of making the thunderbolt appears to have been transferred to these 3 in the yavana world. 

The son of Apollo, the medicine deity, Asklepios, was killed by Zeus with his thunder because he had angered him & Hades by making mortals rise from the dead. In revenge, the 3 Cyclopes were killed by Apollo for making the thunderbolt for Zeus. This is what is depicted on the sealing at the beginning of this thread. 

Interestingly, the 3 Cyclopes are shown like the tricephalic trishiras tvAShTra, who were slain by indra in the shruti. This seems to be a paralogous version of that mytheme in the yavana world: the killing of the 3-headed demonic son of tvaShTR^i, the divine engineer, was transferred to the killing of triadic Titanic assistants of Hephaistos, the yavana divine engineer.
