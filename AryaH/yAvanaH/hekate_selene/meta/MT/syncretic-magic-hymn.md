The opening of a hymn used in yavana equivalent of ShaT-karmANi to 3-headed rudra-class goddess seen as a combination of Artemis, Persephone & Selene from Roman age Egypt (depicted on a seal). The "trika" convergence between the H& yavana worlds are rather notable.

> I offer to you in sacrifice this spice, child of Zeus, shooter of arrows, Artemis, Persephone, deer-huntress, who shine in the night, thrice-resounding, three-voiced, three-headed Selene, [of] three-pointed [weapon?], with three faces and three necks, of the crossroads, you who, in triple baskets, hold the indefatigable fire of the flame and attend to the crossroads and rule the triple decades, with three forms and flames and dogs;  
for this reason, indeed you send a sharp yell from toneless (throats), when you, goddess, raise your voice in a horrid sound with triple mouths.

Another opening of a hymn used in a yavana vashIkaraNa rite. Note the association with the ghosts of the crossroads. Kore->kumarI & the goddess being named Hekate. She is said to be gigantic: The yavana Eucrates gives precise measurements of his vision of her 300 f height& a 30 f sword.

> Come here, Hecate, giant, protectress of Dione, Persia, Baubo, toad, shooter of arrows,
untamed, Lydian, unsubdued, daughter of a noble father, torch-bearer, guide, who bends down haughty necks, Kore, listen, you who have separated doors of indestructible steel, Artemis, who were once overseer, mightiest one,  
mistress, who burst out from the earth, dog-leader, all-tamer, guardian of the roads, three-headed, light-bringer, revered maiden;  
I call you, deer-slayer, cunning, of Hades, with many forms:  
come here, Hecate, goddess of the crossroads, with fire-blowing ghosts,  
to whom have been assigned dreadful roads and harsh witchcrafts.  
I call you Hecate with those who died untimely,
and those among the heroes who may have died without a wife and children, hissing wildly, with animosity in their hearts
[others say: with the appearance of winds].

The hymn with the nAmAvalI of the yavana rudrian goddess with many familiar themes --especially, note the cemetery association

> Hail, goddess, listen to your names.  
I offer you this spice in sacrifice, child of Zeus, shooter of arrows, heavenly, goddess of the harbor, who wander through the mountains, guardian of the roads, infernal, nocturnal, of Hades, gloomy, calm and horrible, who have your meal among the tombs, Night, Erebus, vast Chaos: for you are inevitable Necessity, you are Moira, you Erinys, torture, you destroyer, you Justice. You hold Cerberus in chains, you with scales of dragons;  
dark, with serpent-like locks and girded by serpents,  
blood-drinker, death-bringer, born from destruction, you who eat hearts, flesh-eater, who devour the ones who died untimely, who resound in the graves, who spread frenzy, come to my sacrifices and fulfill this matter for me.
