## pUShA connection 
pUShan also had a caduceus-like rod in the shruti; and goat is the animal of pUShan; and is associated with the dog of agohya. ([details](/devaH/AryaH/hindukaH/pUShA/meta/articles/MT/pUShan-goat-dog/)).

Hermes is one of the yavana cognates of the Arya puShan. The homology here is split between Hermes & his son Pan. While Hermes is a cognate of H puShan, his name might also be a cognate of saramA the mother of the hell-dogs in the H tradition. 


> प॒थ एकः॑ पीपाय॒+++(←प्या वृद्धौ)+++ तस्क॑रो यथाँ  
ए॒ष वे॑द निधी॒नाम् ॥
>
> One makes the paths prosperous, like a thief this one knows the sites of treasures.

This connection with paths & thieves is shared plainly with Hermes.

### Wealth
> Socrates: Is it not well to pray to the deities here before we go?  
Phaedrus: Of course.  
Socrates: O beloved Pan and all ye other Gods of this place, grant to me that I be made beautiful in my soul within, and that all external possessions be in harmony with my inner man,  
> May I consider the wise man rich; and may I have such wealth as only the self-restrained man can bear or endure.  
> Do we need anything more, Phaedrus? For me that prayer is enough.  
Phaedrus: Let me also share in this prayer; for friends have all things in common


> Pūṣā is associated with acquisition of wealth & particularly with recovery of lost wealth (naṣṭadravyaprāpti) (RV 6.54.7, 10) as well as making a stingy man’s heart soft (RV 6.53.3) & in general impelling a man towards the vedamantra (6.53.8). (yām pū̍ṣan brahma̱coda̍nī̱m...) - GA

### All

A yavana sealing showing god Pan with a goat before the fire altar surrounded by the zodiacal belt. In the Greek tradition Socrates in this theological exposition associates Pan with "all" -> pan -- a wordplay. He says: "Then Pan, who declares and always moves (ἀεὶ πολῶν) all..." This is reflected in the sealing as the zodiac. 

Thus, the "all-ness" of Pan in the Socratic discourse has deep roots with a reflex in the vaidika ritual. [Details](/devaHAryaH/hindukaH/pUShA/meta/articles/MT/puShA_all-paths-realms/) 

## Hermes and Pan
In the H world the Ashvin-s, bhava & sharva, skanda& vishAkha are reflexs of the same old IE deities reintroduced by different Aryan streams that entered India. Just like that we hold that Hermes & Pan are to distinct introductions of same puShan-class deity by different streams of Greeks. Following the multiple introductions in both traditions the multiple layers are reconciled as distinct deities through reassignment of syncreticism.
