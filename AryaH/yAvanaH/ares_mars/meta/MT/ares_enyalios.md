title = "Ares Enyalios"

The oldest surviving yavana tradition, Mycenaean separates Enyalios from Ares. I have wondered if there was a skanda-vishAkha kind of pairing even in the yavana world. In support of such a twinning he was identified with Janus Quirinus of the romaka world. The goddess Enyo also might have been a faint reflex of the devasenA like deity whose echo we seen in the romaka world.
