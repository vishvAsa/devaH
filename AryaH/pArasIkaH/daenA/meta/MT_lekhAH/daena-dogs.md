(Pic of an amphora)

A brief discussion of some old IE motifs: Here is Herakles (left) seizing the dog of the netherworld Kerberos (note 2 headed here). Behind the dog is the god Hermes with his caduceus. To the right is the awful Persephone, the goddess of the realm of the dead. While Hermes is a cognate of H puShan but his name might also be a cognate of saramA the mother of the hell-dogs in the H tradition.

Comparable to the Attic amphora, the 2 dogs are depicted here in Iranic iconography from the kuShANa age gandhAra. Here the urvan of a dead Iranian is seen meeting the goddess daenA with the two dogs as he crosses over the bridge cinvato peretu to the realm of the dead. 

daenA has the features of a benign manifestation of Persephone as Kore, reminding one of her favoring Herakles by giving him Kerberos as shown on the above amphora. The H cognate of the dogs appears in the funerary incantation:

> अति॑ द्रव सारमे॒यौ श्वानौ॑  
> चतुर॒क्षौ श॒बलौ॑ सा॒धुना॑ प॒था ।  
> अथा॑ पि॒तॄन् सु॑वि॒दत्राँ॒ उपे॑हि  
> य॒मेन॒ ये स॑ध॒मादं॒ मद॑न्ति ॥
> 
> Speed past the two dogs, sons of saramA, four-eyed and brownish yellow, along the good path. Then approach the benevolent ancestors who are in joyful revelry together with yama.
>
> यौ ते॒ श्वानौ॑ यम-रक्षि॒तारौ॑  
> चतुर॒क्षौ प॑थि॒रक्षी॑ नृ॒चक्ष॑सौ ।  
> ताभ्या॑म् एनं॒ परि॑ देहि राजन्  
> स्व॒स्ति चा॑स्मा अनमी॒वं च॑ धेहि ॥
> 
> Your two dogs, o yama, who are the four-eyed guardians of the path
looking upon men, to them deliver him, o king, and give him weal and a disease-free existence.
>
> उ॒रू॒ण॒साव॑सु॒तृपा॑ उदुम्ब॒लौ य॒मस्य॑ दू॒तौ च॑रतो॒ जनाँ॒ अनु॑ ।
> ताव॒स्मभ्यं॑ दृ॒शये॒ सूर्या॑य॒ पुन॑र्दाता॒मसु॑म॒द्येह भ॒द्रम् ॥
> 
> The 2 broad-nosed, life-stealing, reddish-yellow agents of yama, track down the folks. May these two [dogs] grant an auspicious life again here today to us, to keep seeing the sun.

One notable point is their description as being four-eyed -- a duplication within a duplication. Their duality expressed in the ancient mantra is captured in both the yavana & Iranic iconography. The former further hints an internal duplication in showing them as 2 eyed.
