      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1515398460823977993.html&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(Pic of an amphora)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A brief discussion of some old IE motifs: Here is Herakles (left) seizing the dog of the netherworld Kerberos (note 2 headed here). Behind the dog is the god Hermes with his caduceus. To the right is the awful Persephone, the goddess of the realm of the dead. While Hermes is a cognate of H puShan but his name might also be a cognate of saramA the mother of the hell-dogs in the H tradition.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On 3rd day after an Iranian dies he is said to arrive at the bridge of the dead known as the cinvato peretu.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There if has performed puNya-s he is met by the goddess daena with her dogs in the form of a beautiful woman who gives him a divine drink: shown on seal from gandhAra.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If he has performed pApa-s instead she arrives as dreadful harridan+++(=hag)+++ and he is borne away by the dogs to be judged by raShNu and sraosha. The dogs may be identified with constellations of Canis Major and Minor and the Chinvata bridge with the Milky Way. Was there a constellation with which daenA was identified?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
