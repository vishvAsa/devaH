As a Heathen parent, what will I teach my kids about Santa…

I will teach them that Odin was syncretized with St. Nicholas of Myra in the Netherlands, who was known as an anonymous gift giver, which gave rise to the softened caricature we now know as Santa.

I’ll teach them that while there’s no jolly old man who will literally come down the chimney and leave presents, what lies beneath this caricature is absolutely real; Odin riding through the night sky with our ancestors in winter, the Álfar/Elves, in the Wütende Heer,

And they will bestow the kinds of gifts that are blessings you may not immediately be able to see, and reason he’s able to visit all the children of our folk is because underneath this caricature is a God.

I’ll also teach them that leaving out milk and cookies is a modern remnant of pagan Jólablót sacrifices and leaving out offerings for the Wild Hunt in winter, and we’ll leave out an offering with a proper a blót ceremony before bed.
