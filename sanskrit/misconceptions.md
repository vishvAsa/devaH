## Sanskrit Phobia
- Other analyses:
    - \[Rajiv Malhotra does a [more thorough job](http://rajivmalhotra.com/library/articles/geopolitics-sanskrit-phobia/).\]

### Sanskrit is a dead language.
- Some limited decline:
    - [Q15](https://www.quora.com/Why-isnt-sanskrit-used-anymore).
- Lay use
    - Despite contrary socio-economic forces, it is vitally alive. For numbers, see [this thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/#%21msg/bvparishat/QFqoGrD-KrA/R8NvUSDoWwsJ).
    - Just search Youtube for Sanskrit videos - even omitting ancient hymns, you will find a lot.
    - "Sanskrit villages" -
        - mattUru [1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0I8h5oCbrQ).
- Thriving literary scene and scholarship
    - 200-300 Mahakavyas composed in Sanskrit since independence. Total literary output is much more.
    - I myself am in regular contact - in person and electronically - with a quite a few sanskrit scholars of the very high caliber - even more if you consider second degree contacts.
    - Interesting account of sanskrit use from the perspective of western academics, with references: [NLL](http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=23412).
- Immortality due to early and respected standardization by the grammarians.
    - As suhAsa says [here](http://swarajyamag.com/columns/verses-which-produce-magic-when-re-read/): "The Rāmāyaṇa is atleast 2500 years old. The hanumannāṭaka came more than 1500 years after it. And more than a millennium later came Rāma Śāstrī. And half a century later came Bacchu Subbarāyagupta. This literary chain may not seem unusual at first glance, yet it is an extraordinary thing to happen in a language. Languages come with lifetimes of less than a millennium. Old English is as intelligible to me as Hebrew. Reading Geoffrey Chaucer is like wading through quicksand. Time will ensure libraries move Shakespeare from the literature section to history section. But frozen in time by the spell of Pāṇini, only Classical Sanskrit will remain untouched. A few hundred years from now, a young boy (or girl), having taught himself Sanskrit, may decide to write a work to top Rāma Śāstrī. The poet to top Kālidasa may well be born a thousand years from now. My own descendants may spend a sunday afternoon, sipping soylent, and laughing at their ancestor’s metrical misadventures. How absurd it is to label such a language dead! Immortal is more like it."

### Sanskrit is a hard language.
- Not so - the "grammar translation method" introduced and imposed by the British causes this wrong impression. See this [detailed speech](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZoS1nA8RVko). With an immersive approach, conversational Sanskrit is as easy as any other language. Of course, advanced/ masterful usage requires serveral years of dedicated effort - like in any other language. \[Funny "Hitler learns Sanskrit" [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xv87qb1is9M).\]
- If the right register ([Simple Standard Sanskrit](https://archive.org/details/simple-standard-sanskrit/mode/2up)) is used, sanskrit is quite easy for all Indians. \[chamu [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr8iB6cscjM)\]

### Restricted social role
- Accusation: Sanskrit is the language of Brahmins, and that too male brahmins. Further, it was only used for shAstra-s and kAvya-s.
- In the past - see note on "history" above, which indicates clear usage outside ritual.  
    
- There are plenty of Sanskrit scholars (right from upaniShadic seers such as Aitreya mahidAsa to dArA-shikoh / [Abdul Rahim Khan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdul_Rahim_Khan-I-Khana)) who were not brahmaNa-s or kShatriya-s. Eg: mAtanga-divAkara the chaNDAla \[[TW](https://twitter.com/blog_supplement/status/632370949975883776)\]. bhartRmENTa the mahout.
- Sanskrit is also a liturgical language of buddhism, jainism: even Zoroastrians used it when they came to India and recognized the sanskrit-avestan-monophyly! ([Q1](http://www.quora.com/Why-did-Buddhism-and-Jainism-adopted-Prakrit-instead-of-Sanskrit/answer/Vishvas-Vasuki), [YT15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NRLdoV_Vw8&index=69&list=WL))
- shatAvadhAnI gaNesh on this: [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ff6mVQ_yn2s). Other examples: Abhinavabharatasarasangraha  Mummadi Cikkabhupala (= sippgowDa, a chieftain of Madhugiri, Karnataka), Pedakomati Vemareddy, who wrote an extensive vyAkhyAna to Amaru Shatakam.
- Now foreigners speak and chant Sanskrit quite comfortably ([G15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQg5k1RHitU)). 
- rAjashekhara clearly says in Kavyamimamsa 10th chapter:
    - "पुरुषवद्योषितोऽपि कवीभवेयुः । संस्कारो ह्यात्मनि समवैति, न स्त्रैणं वा पौरुषं वा विभागमपेक्षते । श्रूयन्ते दृश्यन्ते च राजपुत्र्यो महामात्रदुहितरो गणिकाः कौतुकिभार्याश्च शास्त्रप्रहतबुद्धयः कवयश्च ।"
- An excerpt from the education of Princess belavADi mallamma, as recorded by Shesho Srinivas Muthalik in 1705 \[[KPP](http://www.kamat.com/database/books/kareducation/appendix_a.htm#_ftnref1)\] \- "When Mallamma reached five years of age, her education began, along with that of her brother Sadashiva Nayaka. Both of them were taught Kannada, Marathi, Urdu, and Sanskrit . It took them ten years to learn all these languages. The brother and sister were very close and studied together. A school was built for their education and ten senior shāstris were appointed as teachers. In the classes there were boys and girls belonging to various castes (Havyaks, Gouda Saraswats, Nadavars, and Madhwas) in about equal numbers. Shankar Bhat was the principal of the school and was a great scholar. Mallamma was a very good student and an intelligent girl. Everybody admired her intellect. She was drawn to poetry when she was about twelve years old. Sadashiva Nayaka was also fond of poetry and wrote poems in Kannada. Their father, king Madhulinga Nayaka arranged for all the boys to undergo military training and appointed a brave man called Ranavir Singh as the trainer. Mallamma showed an interest in fencing and archery. She also equalled the boys in horse riding and throwing the javelin."
- Modern experience with dalits acquiring sanskrit scholarship shows more support than deprecation.
    - Kumud Pawde (Mahar 1960-s [GB](https://books.google.com/books?id=NN48WUBx_54C&lpg=PP1&pg=PA85#v=onepage&q&f=false)) 

### Sanskrit literature reinforces the hindu caste system.
- Why single out Sanskrit epics for this analysis? What about Hindi, Tamil, Kannada, Telugu epics that also reinforce that system? All ancient scholarship (irrespective of language and country), was to a huge degree, elite scholarship.
- Why would you turn a blind eye to mountains of Sanskrit works which talk nothing about caste or gender roles in a way you dislike?

### Money
- Sanskrit is not the optimal language to learn in order to earn more money. So, we should ditch it and teach German, Chinese, etc.. \[[FP](http://www.firstpost.com/india/speak-german-smriti-iranis-hindutva-agenda-dims-prospects-kendriya-vidyalaya-students-1802783.html)\]
    - Earning more money is not the only reason to teach languages to our children. There are very strong humanistic and aesthetic reasons to favor Sanskrit. If we want diversity in the international languages taught to our children, that is welcome - let them compete with English - not Sanskrit.

### Sanskrit suppresses other (Indian) languages.
- Some languages have an oppressor - oppressed relationship. Eg: Arabic vs Egyptian. English vs Iniut. Though Sanskrit was a link language across Asia, this was not the case with Sanskrit and other languages. Rather, their relationship was of the nourisher-nourished type.
- Ancient local language poets acknowledged their debt to sanskrit and sanskrit literature.
    - Again and again, the Tamil shaiva saints speak of how shiva revealed truth in Aariyam and Tamil. [1](http://www.thevaaram.org/thirumurai_1/songview_en.php?thiru=10&Song_idField=10103&padhi=%20&startLimit=8&limitPerPage=1&sortBy=&sortOrder=DESC), [2](http://thevaaram.org/thirumurai_1/songview.php?Song_idField=50180&limitPerPage=1&padhi=018&sortBy=&sortOrder=DESC&startLimit=3&thiru=5), [3](http://thevaaram.org/en/thirumurai_1/songview.php?thiru=11&Song_idField=11033&padhi=040&startLimit=72&limitPerPage=1&sortBy=&sortOrder=DESC&Submit=Please+go)
- Linguists say that Sanskrit \*borrowed\* from as well as lent words to other languages (a hallmark of living languages).
    - Sanskritization is often involved in the process of borrowing.
        - This involves coining newer more Sanskrit words that sound similar to the alien word.
            - Eg. sultan → सुरत्राणः chocolate→ चाकलेहः mughal → मौद्गल। (Hammira-kaavya)
        - Inspiration is drawn from the nirukta and the uNAdi sUtra-s of grammar to legitimize the use of these new words.
    - Examples
        - Borrowed words from farsi - कलम। दीनार। (both used by kShemendra)
        - Borrowed from prAkRta-s .
            - भर्ता (Sanskrit) → भट्टा (Prakrit) → भट्ट (Later sanskrit - kShemendra). Similarly, (gRha, geha) and (mUDha, mugdha).
            - kumarIla bhaTTa seems to have argued how words like pika come from prAkRtas.
        - English words and etymological inspiration
            - 92 Hoch study [here](https://archive.org/download/ANoteOnEnglishAndModernSanskritHansHenrichHock).
            -  English words appearing in arjunwadekar's poems
- In classical sanskrit aesthetic works (eg: rAjashekhara) the poet is esteemed by his ability to compose in Sanskrit as well as prakrits; and aesthetic quality is considered to be not-very language-dependent. Most examples of very high-quality poetry (dvani-kAvya) in Sanskrit works came from Prakrit, even if the author chose Sanskrit examples for mediocre and poor poetry!!
- In south India there works composed in a mixture of Sanskrit and the local language (eg: maNipravaLa).
- Sanskrit enriched local languages - with its special ability to coin new words.
    - A grateful acknowledgement of influence on Thai - [YTTh2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWp-xyBxWQg).
    - Sanskrit enrichment of telugu - [IF15](http://indiafacts.co.in/samskrutandhramulu-a-symphony-down-the-ages/).
- Works were composed for the study of Prakrits and apabhraMsha-s in Sanskrit (of course, with an intention of \*preserving\* the prAkrits and their treasures). Examples: Hemachandra's 8th chapter, kAshmIra-shabdAnushAsanam, etc..
- References: Balram Shukla's [answer here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvEmb8p0oZA&list=PLPYaOgCOpkjxI0DnNHK9M5e0T8lbTp7h-&t=1545).

### Modern tech terms
- Accusation: You cannot do or teach modern technical subjects (eg. maths, physics, chemistry, biology...) in sanskrit.
- False - You can, and it will be quite precise, meaningful and fun. Example of a brief description of titration and stellar chain reactions - [MT16](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2016/05/21/svabha%E1%B9%A3aya%E1%B9%83-sastriya-sik%E1%B9%A3a/) ([TW16](https://twitter.com/agnimaan/status/769049896922013697)).
- Chinese, Japanese, Israelis and Germans do science in their own languages. Among them, Hebrew is a revived language.
- That said, we can still concede that we can expediently use English for such subjects while retaining sanskrit for the soft sciences.

### Impractical to switch
- It is impractical to switch to using sanskrit as the link language of India.
    - Hebrew example: [WP15](https://agnimaan.wordpress.com/2015/09/12/link-language-question-hebrew-revival-and-sanskrit-revival/).

## Superficially pro-Sanskrit falsehood

- NASA uses Sanskrit.
    - False. NASA website does not any mention such program.
- Sanskrit is the best suited for interacting with a computer. (Originally [proposed by](http://www.aaai.org/ojs/index.php/aimagazine/article/view/466) Rick Briggs.)
    - Semantic context-freeness is different from syntactic context-freeness.
        - Example by suhAsa - "मित्रं कलत्रम् अपश्यत्" – Did the wife see the friend or did the friend see the wife?
    - There is some truth to the continued value of the kAraka-analysis of Sanskrit grammar (same concept was presented in [this](http://www.ted.com/talks/ajit_narayanan_a_word_game_to_communicate_in_any_language?language=en) Ted talk).
- Other languages don't have a finite set of root words. Other languages don't gave a finite set of grammatical rules.
    - There is no doubt that pANini's vyAkaraNa is a marvel, but consider the below.
    - Sanskrit literature - right from veda-s through vAlmIkI, vyAsa and kAlidAsa to modern times - has shown plenty of irregular forms.
    - छन्दोविषये - 
        - कृपया "[व्यत्ययो बहुलम्](http://sanskritdocuments.org/learning_tools/ashtadhyayi/vyakhya/3/3.1.85.htm)"  इति पाणिनीयस्य सूत्रस्य विवरणं जानीहि। तेन स्फुटं मन्ये महर्षेर् अन्ते पराजयाङ्गीकारः \- यथा कथमपि विचित्रशब्दा भवन्तीति। पुनश्चान्यान्य् अपि भवन्ति सूत्राणि (छन्दस्युभयथा) ये इतोऽपि पोषयन्ति भावमिमम्।
        - Observe the explanation of "छन्दसि दृष्टानुविधि" [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxnNReA-1u4#t=2398).
    - पाणिनीयव्याकरणं केवलं साधुत्वप्रदर्शनाय स्यान्नाम छन्दस्सु बहुशः, न पुनः निश्चप्रचं साधुत्वनिश्चये। एवमन्यान्यपि सूत्राणि "बहुल"\-शब्दयुक्तानि भवन्त्येव लक्षणग्रन्थस्यास्य सीमाबोधकानि \- अन्ते लक्ष्यमेव शरणम् तेषु स्थानेष्व् इति तदभिप्रायः।
- Sanskrit texts reveal that ancient hindu-s had flying machines, atom bombs etc.. There is plenty of "undeciphered scientific knowledge" in Sanskrit texts.
    - puShpaka-vimAna in the Ramayana and the vaimAnika-shAstra merely show the excellent imagination of their authors. \[[MT](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2007/07/23/vaimanika-shastra/)\]
    - This is not to deny that ancient hindu scientists and mathematicians expressed themselves using Sanskrit.
- Sanskrit is the mother of all languages / most languages/ Indo European languages.
    - As suhAsa says: _"She’s just one of the close relatives of the actual mother - The Proto Indo-European Language. Calling Sanskrit the "Mother of Languages" is like saying "The Chimpanzee is the father of man""_

## Known sources of errors

- As of 2016 - some Samsrita Bharati books including "Pride of India" \[[TW16](https://twitter.com/sudarshanhs/status/774433418515849216)\] and "kovida text". \[[TW16](https://twitter.com/blog_supplement/status/774418049642487810)\]

## Negative Impact, addenda

- Falsehood in favor of Sanskrit damages the respectability of both the language and its lovers.
    - As suhAsa says: "Word-offerings of praises (read lies) will do nothing to revive the language. Learn the language, speak it, enjoy its literary richness and then proudly wear the badge of Sanskrit on your chest."
- Other analyses:

## Who are the anti-sanskrit campaigners?

- General anti-intellectual idiots. Eg. [NE16](http://kathmandupost.ekantipur.com/news/2016-09-08/tongue-tied.html)
- Anti hindu groups
    - Various communist groups. Eg. [NE16](http://kathmandupost.ekantipur.com/news/2016-09-08/tongue-tied.html)
    - Various muslim groups.
    - Various Christian groups.
- Regionalists who are afraid (without much basis, and shortsightedly) that sanskrit popularization will reduce the influence of their regional language.
-
