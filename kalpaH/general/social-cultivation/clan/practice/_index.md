## Correspondence of theory with practice
- Frameworks always exist and make sense once defined - irrespective of how closely they were practiced. Whether or not one writes in the hindu decimal system, it exists.
- What matters to us (and the creators and interpreters of the many many dharmashAstra works) is - how useful is the framework in **organizing** or systematizing the society to make it function smoothly.

## Overlay of varNa-s on jAti-s
- varNa-s were overlaid on/ mapped to many many pre-existing jAti-s (which could vary). These jAti-s and sub-jAti-s had their own hierarchies and restrictions on marriage and inter-dining beyond what the varNa-system required.
- These myriad jAti-s were hypothesized to have arisen from the main varNa-s mixing together in various ways.
- brAhmaNa-s learned in the dharmashAstra-s adjudicated disputes regarding varNa-assignment.
- More details in [varNa subpage](varNa/).

## Sentimental life, rituals and Ananda pursuit
- This closely followed the theory described [here](../varna-theory/) (search term: Ananda).
- In some cases, brAhmaNa-s accepted non-brAhmaNa saints as honored gurus.
    - There are cases like a shrIvaiShNava brAhmaNa carrying a dalit on his shoulders so that he could visit the deva without violating temple rules, falling at their feet, insisting on eating food leftover after serving them ( [rAmAnuja](http://www.iskcontimes.com/archive/ramanuja-chides-his-wife) ).
    - madhusUdana-sarasvatI initiated many sannyAsins from other dvija-varNa-s with the intention of protecting brAhmaNa sannyAsins as suggested by bIrbal \[[IMG](http://i.imgur.com/WLSY6VL.jpg)\].
    - matsyendranAtha's 1k year old tradition initiates non-brAhmaNa sannyAsins as well.  

## jAti position relative to mlecCha-s
- mlecCha-s were in practice treated better than the lowest strata of the native society. This made sense since they brought with them military and economic power which hindus wanted to deal with, and since they were located outside India.
- This proved mal-adaptive when the mlecCha-s started living and breeding in the Arya lands. For example: A low-jAti person converted to a muslim or christian would be treated much better. This contributed to their increase in numbers. (../More [here](future/).)
