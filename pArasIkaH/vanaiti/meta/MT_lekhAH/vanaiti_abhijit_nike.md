A kuShANa coin showing the Eastern Iranic deity of victory vainaiti. In Zoroastrian branch of the tradition, the deity is the male vanant associated with the star Vega (ùõº Lyrae). This evidently goes back to the proto-I-Ir period in the least as the vedic abhijit has an identical connotation & etymology; e.g. the taittirIya shruti states: ‡§Ö‡•í‡§≠‡§ø‡•í‡§ú‡§Ø‡•ë‡§§‡•ç ‡§™‡•í‡§∞‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡§æ‡•ë‡§¶‡•ç ‡§Ö‡•í‡§≠‡§ø‡§ú‡§ø‡•ë‡§§‡•ç | The change in gender in the Eastern Iranosphere seems to be a departure from the ancestral state. 

The iconography is clearly influenced by the cognate Greek deity Nike. Hence, 1 wonders if the gender shift was also influenced by the Greek deity who appeared in the region during the yavana conquests & is often shown as being held by Zeus in the Indo-Greek coins. However, it may not be so simple as the H tradition as a female abhijiti going along with abhijit. For e.g. the taittirIya shruti has: ‡§Ö‡•í‡§≠‡§ø‡§ú‡§ø‡•ë‡§§‡•ç‡§Ø‡•à‡•í ‡§∏‡•ç‡§µ‡§æ‡§π‡§æ·≥ö ‡•§ 

From the YV tradition abhijiti is generally understood as the star Œµ Lyrae beside Vega. Thus, it is not impossible that the E Ir tradition already had a female variant of vanant paralleling the Vedic abhijiti. The worship of vanant or vanaiti in the E Ir world is indicated by a toponym -- the place close to what is today Bukhara in Ozbekistan was likely the seat of his/her cult. Unfortunately, little remains after its destruction by the marUnmatta-s.
